1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
city right now I am head of customer
strategy for ionic but tired of a day

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,780
was a city for nine and a half years
where Iran's security strategy and

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,829
standards for both enterprise and
consumer the bank it was easily the

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,840
greatest job ever had with the most
responsibility and the farthest reach

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:25,119
every day I got to sit and in addition
to my team writing standards and

6
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,289
basically how the bank would operate
from a data security perspective but on

7
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,119
top of that I got to define the strategy
where we were going to be in the next 5

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:38,129
10 15 years I had a great team had an
amazing mentors and visibility at the

9
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:44,809
highest levels of the bank to talk about
what made me believe we have to go back

10
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:48,218
a little bit but it's just a disclaimer
this next flight is not pretty

11
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:57,219
me 1989 when I joined the Air Force and
got my first taste of cryptography I was

12
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:01,890
working on it for Sunday tens and part
of the job was to every morning take the

13
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,420
keys out of all loadout

14
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,880
communications and identify friend or
foe systems for the stories of the day

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,360
at the end of the day with 0 lights out
planes and we would take the keys and

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,630
effectively revoke them what that really
meant was putting them into a coffee can

17
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,289
enlighten them on fire so that was
almost thirty years ago and key

18
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,650
management has not really is that it's
digitized but it has really gotten any

19
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:32,740
better since then I've spent most of my
career focusing on cryptography and

20
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,570
identity essentially trying to enable
the business trying to get businesses to

21
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,110
be able to use their data while keeping
the data safe keep data safe to encrypt

22
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,060
to encrypt it you have to deal with keys
so essentially what ever the solution

23
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,790
was whether it was forced to carrying
online payments or email our healthcare

24
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,430
records it was always about key
management it was always about

25
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:01,170
encrypting and decrypting the data under
the right circumstances event

26
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,509
chilly when I made it to city and it
started working on that job I found out

27
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:15,800
what it really means and a large large
enterprise so as my boss is telling me

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,760
the things that I need to take care of
it essentially still boils down to key

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,920
management but key management on a
massive scale we had thousands of

30
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,040
commercial off-the-shelf software and
thousands and thousands of customized

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,519
applications as well as completely
home-grown application built by over

32
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,280
40,000 developers with scores a regional
regulators in a hundred and eight or

33
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,030
more countries is a massive undertaking
and within that it was things like

34
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,870
publications and reports internal and
external secure collaboration mobile

35
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,860
cloud secure storage custom apps
everything all of that was my job to

36
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,900
solve from a strategy perspective
nothing bad grade while doing what any

37
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,510
good security person dead I first went
to our policies and our standards and I

38
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,720
started to look at how do they work and
change them so we changed our standards

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,579
and made them very much believe they
told you everything you needed to know

40
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:20,600
key sizes algorithms hashing where to
store your keys how to use the keys what

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,100
kind of data needs to be protected how
it has to be protected how to keep it

42
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,519
all the good stuff

43
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,130
dishes are done right that's it I got a
policy should not to do anything else

44
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:36,040
but it turns out in reality is what
happens is somewhere within the

45
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,048
institution something has to get done
right and a boner wants to make money or

46
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:44,510
enable something with it is that so he
says hey I'm gonna do the school thing

47
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:49,480
with social security numbers for example
and security says that's awesome you

48
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,420
should totally do that here is the
policy yet to secure it and after being

49
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,690
sworn at a lot and given some obscene
finger gestures they go off and they

50
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,139
ever talk to their vendor or the
application engineers and say security

51
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,340
says I have to secure my I can use to
careless and if it's a vendor they'll

52
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,370
say absolutely sinus and if it's your
engineers they'll ask the policy and

53
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,280
then go do it what that really means
though

54
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,910
is crypto and data protection tools are
built into the application and even

55
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,120
though the policy says how to do things
there's still room for interpretation

56
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,940
and so the individual developers looking
at things like encryption algorithms and

57
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,919
hashing and key size random number
generation all about and on top of that

58
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,159
it's where do you store the key and most
likely are not using HSM because there

59
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,280
are thousands and thousands of apps and
that's a lot of money so they had to

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,549
struggle and software for policy says he
can't story key in the clear and

61
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,980
software so you have to encrypt ok well
im crept into a password

62
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,870
all right we're gonna password you can
store a password in the clear how well

63
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:59,970
encrypt the password but because I okay
well we'll use a secure system that you

64
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,940
can buy that stores passwords and
applications can check them out how do

65
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:10,389
you do that just how well his password
so you end up with this catch-twenty two

66
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:15,660
turkeys or passwords some form of
another being stored in the Cliq there

67
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,890
is no real solution for that at the
moment so within large institutions is

68
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,039
usually waivers for that there are ways
to get through it but it's difficult an

69
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,760
ugly one off thats not back right i
contain my data right inside that app so

70
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:38,120
insecure desired at 11 that up only is
it created used Hyundai their know your

71
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,669
data goes everywhere it's in BYOD to
mobile devices at the cloud and hybrid

72
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:47,849
cloud application sharing data with each
other you have users exporting data to

73
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,080
manipulate in Word or Excel and
importing it into another application

74
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,229
for reports your data is everywhere it
doesn't live in that little box so why

75
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:00,349
do we spend all that money just on the
little box and right now we're just

76
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,620
looking at one at one little thing

77
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,000
if we scaled back up to even a small
line of business for looking at maybe

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,750
fourteen little things

79
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,699
14 little places where I had to spend
money and resources individually

80
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:19,570
designing and implementing these
security walls to contain my their

81
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,889
secure the data is secure inside those
containers but is it enable are you

82
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,460
getting the most value out of it I don't
think so

83
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:33,169
so if we step up earlier in the
organization I realized that looks

84
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:37,340
complicated than its supposed to
demonstrate the scale and a large

85
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,580
organization like city it doesn't I
tried to do it accurately and I broke

86
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,340
PowerPoint so I had to scale it back
down to a much smaller amount of notes

87
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,349
but that's essentially what we do that's
what we do as an industry that's what we

88
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:56,389
do as a data security professionals as
we see cracks and systems and things and

89
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:01,210
containers but we don't secure data the
data is still locked up in those places

90
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,780
that get shared

91
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,250
shared badly you haven't enabled it and
you haven't gotten to the place where

92
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,639
you need to be to let your day to
flourish because what we end up with is

93
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,650
this centralized security policy model
our methodology that is created and done

94
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:23,650
central right but it's implemented and
interpreted at the individual

95
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,989
application and vendor spaces netscape
has their own version of crypto that

96
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,990
they did it using standards but they do
their thing

97
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:35,930
hi does there are message does its thing
but they're all independent and they're

98
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,460
all individual they're all done second
day when I said and they come into my

99
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,400
office to pitch their products and I
hear or start to grow them about key

100
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,330
management and how they're handling the
important aspects of that data the

101
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,859
answers are bad practice not that they
are doing it and not doing it securely

102
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,330
but they're not doing it in a way that
lets me share my data to move things out

103
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,698
to rotate keys to swap out vendors if I
need to know my data is still confined

104
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:05,820
in those applications of those sweet for
those services so how about protecting

105
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,129
my data we haven't

106
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:13,339
we're still stuck we're still using the
same technologies the same methodologies

107
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:22,619
that we've been using for more than 20
years where if I go back to this model I

108
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:26,819
don't have a hundred different LDAP
directories I don't have a hundred

109
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:31,649
different implementations of access
control and authentication I get SAML

110
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:38,500
OpenID Canet I don't have point-to-point
encryptor anymore because I have open

111
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,839
standards for VPN and TLS where's my
innovation for data protection

112
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,219
this is what we end up with because
within a business you can get your data

113
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,720
effectively shared throughout all the
different areas that he needed to him in

114
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,959
ways you need to enable them

115
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,649
guess what neither can your partners for
your businesses for their businesses and

116
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:02,449
their customers none of them can so this
is the world we live in

117
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:08,589
we have all these silence and containers
of data and scrapping and the businesses

118
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,380
the ones that we're all here to support
the ones that we're trying to enable

119
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,949
because they're the ones that make the
money and they're the ones that

120
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:22,439
eventually find our budget are not happy
because they just want their Dana and

121
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:29,040
despite all of our efforts we are still
just a cost center security and almost

122
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,910
no organization is a benefit for not
making money when I bring it into the

123
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,969
bank were taking it away so we don't
show anything from the value of their

124
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,870
and hopefully not being in the news so
seeing all that and realizing it from

125
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,740
that fifty thousand foot level at what I
needed to take care of within the bank

126
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,819
to really do my job I had to start over
I had to think of a new way to approach

127
00:09:54,819 --> 00:10:00,349
the whole thing because the past 20
years what we've been doing all this

128
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,089
time isn't working and so

129
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,629
what I tried to do a step back and look
at what we're trying to accomplish what

130
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:09,329
does the security policy do what does it
say

131
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:14,498
and really what it's trying to answer
these five questions about data line is

132
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:19,449
your data when is it valid but when
should people be able to see it if

133
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:24,339
you're doing a financial report to the
SEC I don't want that data leaked before

134
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:30,079
it supposed to be leaked where's my dad
about it if I have confidential PII on

135
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,170
South Korean citizens I shouldn't be
able to look at that data from

136
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:40,099
Uzbekistan should only be viewed within
South Korea hasn't who is allowed to

137
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,540
look at my data that's pretty self
explanatory and how what can be done

138
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,839
with my data under what circumstances of
the basics right that's what we're

139
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,089
trying to accomplish with our data
protection strategy on top of that it

140
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:56,899
used to be good enough to just know who
has access to stuff you used to be able

141
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:00,800
to tell the regulators here's the people
who have access to or can change

142
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,209
financial data for example that's not
good enough anymore because now what

143
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:10,550
they want to know is not just who has
access to it but who is accessing it

144
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:16,679
where they accessing it from what are
they doing with it the same basic sets

145
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:21,870
of questions from a visibility
perspective so as I'm looking at those

146
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,699
pieces I start to think that if I'm
going to have that visibility peace and

147
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:31,859
that awareness of data in every aspect
that I then can get what has to be said

148
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,249
in every 2016 presentation is behavioral
analytics so because I have visibility

149
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:42,759
into the who what where when and how my
data I should also then be able to act

150
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:48,319
on that date and I see that Alice got a
bad review last week and the next day

151
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:52,550
she's downloading the customer database
and the AHR records for payroll which

152
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,540
she normally doesn't do black so I
should be able to act on that I should

153
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,129
be able to do something with that data
the only way I could see that something

154
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:05,410
like this could happen was data
protection as a service

155
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:11,800
so I started trying to come up with a
way that you could take this data policy

156
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,910
and turn it into action and control one
of the things my boss asked me to

157
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,709
accomplish and I completely ignoring me
they had no idea what he was talking

158
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:26,290
about he said he wanted human language
machine enforceable policy and I didn't

159
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:33,149
get it until I started dryness and what
it really means is I want a central

160
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:37,939
point but not only has the policy and
control and rules about my data and

161
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:41,670
everything that goes along with it but a
centralized place where apps and

162
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,449
services and devices can ask questions
about can say I need a key for this or I

163
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:54,680
need to access that so how about one on
the left hand side you would have a data

164
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,479
protection as a service enabled a phone
BYOD device a server that's processing

165
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,629
credit card data whatever it right and
it would be unable to support data

166
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:12,509
protection as a service so if I take the
example of a Word document and I'm

167
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:16,589
creating a word document for my employee
base to say here's what their reviews

168
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:19,800
are what their bonuses should be in
their raises and I'm gonna send it to my

169
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,889
boss so I just create this word document
and I just click Save in the background

170
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:30,649
the application itself for the plugin or
whatever that is enabled says ok I see

171
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,230
that this is sensitive data this is a
short day 2 I'm gonna call up the

172
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,750
service I've got payroll information
what should I do with it and the service

173
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,790
is gonna say ok I'm going to put these
tax on it you're gonna tell me

174
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,649
everything I know so the application is
going to say this is Mike bass he's on

175
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:51,019
the network he's on his laptop its 4:02
p.m. and is in North Dakota so the data

176
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:54,680
protection as a service now has
information metadata about the data that

177
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,138
was created it then in turn is gonna
stay right here is kiid number 2010 I

178
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:05,639
want to protect that data the app gonna
take Eid number 27 know that the app

179
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,990
didn't have to generate keys they didn't
have to figure out where to store keys

180
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,750
it didn't have

181
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:14,820
to do any of that just asked for key the
service created the key sent to the at

182
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:21,720
the abuses in RAM only encrypt the data
deletes the key saves the file so I now

183
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,310
have a single key which is encrypted a
single block of Dana in this example is

184
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,349
word of it could be a single cell in
Excel spreadsheet or field in a database

185
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,990
or a field in a web application and it
saves and now I'm a lot to Alice was the

186
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,200
manager and I say here's what I want to
pay my employees please check the doc

187
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,010
she opens up the doc just double
clicking on it in the background data

188
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,569
protection as a Service enable that
calls up the service and says hey I'm

189
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:55,770
Alice analysis machine on the network
its 4:45 p.m. and I'm in North Dakota

190
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:02,350
can I have access to key number 27 the
data protection as a service takes all

191
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,260
that metadata stories so that we get
analytics invisibility decides based on

192
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,720
policy is Alice my manager is she in a
jar is she on the corporate network is

193
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,220
it within the time frame which normally
does stuff and it makes a decision yes

194
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,530
or no

195
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:22,180
can alice have access to key any number
twenty seven if so release the key key

196
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:27,449
idea over 27 comes down to it is
decrypted Ramli Alice now has access

197
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:33,570
messed up I want to have an extra $1,000
she makes a change quick safe same

198
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,290
process the applications of crap I have
to save this which means I have to

199
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,250
encrypted I'm gonna call up the service
a service this was written with caddie

200
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:50,250
number twenty seven key and services
sure his caddie number 28 and then the

201
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,339
same basis repeats it saves it now
something amazing happened there whether

202
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:54,010
you know it or not

203
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:59,710
not only did I just automate key
rotation but I'm actually done a lot

204
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,200
more so first of all key rotation is a
massive pain point in any company of

205
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,110
scale whether you know it or not

206
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,300
anybody in here trying to deal with
shower on getting rid of any

207
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,300
organization to pay

208
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:18,850
to see if I can give you a new key on
demand any time data has changed and I

209
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,130
can rotate or change those keys at any
time

210
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,760
than my policy decides what it's quick
cryptic if tomorrow

211
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,920
quantum computing comes out and I
realized that all of my a symmetric keys

212
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,750
are dead and a yes 256 is no longer good
enough to make a change in policy if I

213
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,160
don't you show one anymore make a change
in policy every key issues from that

214
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,550
point on uses the new policy not the old
policy any time data is written Newquay

215
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:48,069
in south korea says from now on only
south korean data can be viewed within

216
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,480
South Korea and the keys will only live
in South Korea I can either use the old

217
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,810
way in which case I had to change every
application I home within South Korea to

218
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:04,250
respect that or I can use this model and
make a checkbox that say from now on

219
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,199
using geolocation only allowed access to
South Korean data key access within

220
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,209
South Korea if you look at it from the
next step up this is what it looks like

221
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:20,100
an alien within the applications within
the vendor space across the board what

222
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:25,800
matters here is the bomb the bottom is
the data it is not application specific

223
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,030
that data can go anywhere because the
key is tied to the data not the apt not

224
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:36,190
the place not the thing not container
the data is free to go wherever as long

225
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,420
as whatever you have

226
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:43,820
understands data protection as a service
this is not harm in theory we can stand

227
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,310
up against some of our 40,000 developers
and built this city but does that solve

228
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:52,020
the problem it doesn't because even if I
deploy this completely throughout my

229
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,200
organization I haven't solved it because
I just made a bigger silent now I'm big

230
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,690
silo his city I got all my crap covered
but my data doesn't just stay in my

231
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:06,900
organization I'm got aggregators like
Menton into it and whoever else and we

232
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,540
share data with other banks and the
government and consumers with statements

233
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:17,070
and mobile apps so I still haven't
really solve the problem because I don't

234
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,470
work if they did we'd all be using our
mess right now na na can Microsoft in

235
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,340
our mass

236
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,990
but that doesn't work it cannot be a
single vendor cannot be a single

237
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:33,590
solution what we need is a standard what
has to happen is the evolution of data

238
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:39,340
protection the same way that we had the
evolution idea of identity and

239
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,309
authentication and authorization
entitlements all of it because you don't

240
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:46,320
build those things you go out and buy
and you have your choice of vendors to

241
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,230
choose from because it's an open
standard what we need for data

242
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,980
protection as a service is an open
standard open source SDKs and tools to

243
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,990
enable the sharing of data and the
understanding of policy between

244
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:04,330
organizations so that a city doesn't
break the compliance policies of Bank of

245
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,370
America as an example currently I could
easily encryption and secure PDF and

246
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,668
send it to Bank of America people and
they can open it by Bank of America

247
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:16,990
compliance doesn't like that because
they can't open it so we have to have

248
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,120
the interoperability and the standard
that things can build from this is the

249
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:30,668
way that things have to go what we get
on top of that is data about data so it

250
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:36,490
used to be that it was just about your
data right how do I enable him but now I

251
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,299
could actually provide a value I could
provide a cost safe because I have a

252
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:45,799
cryptographic representation I don't
ever see the data service just these

253
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:47,389
keys and metadata

254
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,210
because I have that metadata I have a
cryptographic representation so I can

255
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:56,120
know every duplicate file for example
your organization its usage where it

256
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,120
lives where it is how often has been
opened its expiration period

257
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,830
retention how much money can you save
just knowing back I'm a crypto person so

258
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,230
I don't even know all the value of the
data about the data I just know that it

259
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,779
brings up a new issue which is the next
thing with businesses will scream for

260
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,190
his house my data being used and what
can I do with it

261
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:24,480
that was my goal was getting this level
of data protection as a service and I

262
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,510
thought I was hot and I came up with the
greatest thing ever and I was excited

263
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:35,410
about it and so I went to the venture
capitalists city and the various artists

264
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,670
that we talked to and said we need this
this is what we need to do find me

265
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,680
somebody that does it had never heard of
anyone that does it I didn't think they

266
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:49,350
would find anyone that did it but they
did and so I met with those people and I

267
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:53,120
met with those organizations and as soon
as I realize that anybody was even close

268
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,739
I called my boss and said i'm not today
but I'm going to because this is bigger

269
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,120
than me and it's bigger than city and I
want to be a part of solving this is my

270
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,520
grass this is what I've been doing since
1989 is trying to solve key management

271
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,960
but in a prettier way that doesnt make
it sound like a management this is Dan

272
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,250
enablement and so after I told him I was
leaving I met with companies that were

273
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,300
closer to solving this problem and found
the one that was willing to make it open

274
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,010
to make it an open source and open
protocol that can be shared

275
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:36,800
so that that reality that I show can
happen and that is why was he questions

276
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:27,649
so specific product information than the
first thing I wanna make sure is clear

277
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:32,939
is the application that's doing the work
that's encrypting did not generate the

278
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,559
key key came from the service the
service maintains all keys so yes

279
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,779
absolutely has to maintain all keys and
has to be a built Google scale kind of

280
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:45,469
cloud solution that covers this the one
thing I didn't talk about and this

281
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:49,299
should be a priority for anybody is even
though this needs to be a cloud-based

282
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:53,129
service because you have to have things
that BYOD and mobile and consumer facing

283
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:58,689
the keys themselves should be owned
controlled and in the possession of the

284
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:04,029
organization using it right so I'm City
stand-up sure there's a cloud service

285
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:08,589
but there must be an on premise key
service cookies stay here cloud service

286
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:12,690
cannot have access to the keys period
they can orchestrate so he can be

287
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:17,089
encrypted from here to Alice and passed
through the orchestration but the

288
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:20,379
orchestration engine that cloud service
cannot have access to keys but yes it's

289
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:47,109
a massive key database product the
company I work for is solving this they

290
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:49,639
are most of the way there there's a
couple of pieces I would like further

291
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:53,408
like the open-source bit but it's coming
essentially the way that it reaches

292
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:58,099
every piece of data is tied to a key
every kazakh Eid Eid hasn't leave a 64

293
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:03,499
bit key space in the name which means
the kiid supports a trillion keys per

294
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:08,309
user 10 it so a single tenant could have
a single case base that supports a

295
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:12,379
trillion keys you can have multiple case
basis so that data on that logic is all

296
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:15,379
within the data structure

297
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:38,040
that is much more complicated slide but
I don't have with me there is a

298
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,610
registration process that takes place
it's something we called their hardline

299
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,919
exchange and someone that registration
process happens there is a sharing of

300
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,050
secret keys between the end point that's
being registered and the on premise at

301
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:57,129
the city-owned in this example now just
to be clear city 25 as he had anything

302
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:02,120
like that this is an example and that
registration process dusky Sharon

303
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,510
separate to that after the registration
process so now you're on premise has a

304
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,750
key your agent has a key they can't read
data for each other there is also an

305
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:15,150
additional pipe so everything is done
over SSL TLS but there is also an

306
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:20,270
additional 80 S type that is created
within the TLS donald manning the middle

307
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:24,590
so if you just blew culture example in
front of it to do a song collection it's

308
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,820
not gonna see it and even if it did the
data within the pipe itself is also

309
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,330
encrypted to the key that the agent
asked and vice versa when the agent has

310
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:36,649
sent its metadata back its encrypted to
the on premise separate to that there's

311
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:41,600
another key agreement basically between
the cloud service and the on premise key

312
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,050
services in the cloud service and client
you know that's a lot single answer

313
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:56,409
thanks

314
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,090
really went
