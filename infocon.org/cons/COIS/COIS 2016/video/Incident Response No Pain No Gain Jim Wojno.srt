1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,450
increase sure is a response gave how you
can make this is painful and it's kind

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,730
of hard is no longer being want to do is
try to use the tools and capabilities

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:18,730
and follow framework and you'll see the
framework of because large that you can

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:25,310
use to compare it gets your heart it
cool if your valuation for instance

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,210
responds to view this is sort of a good
framework for a good I keep in mind it's

6
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:39,350
true that two ways to improve your
current processors and without making it

7
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:46,340
as far as possible that sort of the
lands in the balance of power as it is

8
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:52,530
between the adversarial responder the
balance of horrific attack attack

9
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,230
participate the place and time format it
can be very patient persist in fact if

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,419
you're dealing with a professional
adversarial they're very patient very

11
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:10,299
distant just as you come into three
operations center or work or network

12
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:13,950
security of where your role is within
the different organizations you

13
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,409
represent a hardship in and their role
their job is to break your network

14
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,320
fielder David whether that's for
intellectual property or with this for

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,179
financial gain

16
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,479
regardless there that's their job that's
what they do they're professionals and

17
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:38,000
they know how to do this because the day
this is their job they will take their

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,600
time

19
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,100
gathered a lot of information about
their target so that they can understand

20
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,729
exactly what we present in an
organization and then uses weaknesses to

21
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:52,689
get the environment and once they're
inside the environment they have a plan

22
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:57,110
for what they want to do and how they go
about executing as quickly as possible

23
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,510
so you know the fact that matter is the
sad fact of the matter is that

24
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:08,600
never resided traditionally been a
member of the blue jeans so pain you

25
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,669
know to succeed

26
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:15,769
time to tackle really only has two and
so you know

27
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:23,120
balance of power definitely does not
favor so this is for the typical stock

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,180
analysts

29
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,300
stop hurting my network so you stop
attacking my heart systems because they

30
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:37,690
just basically again now that somehow I
think so the idea here is this shift the

31
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:44,329
balance of power on this and what are
some strategies the way we use to

32
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,160
increase the pain on the adversary were
some ways that we can make this

33
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:59,680
difficult as possible for Siri
recognizing that I T securities

34
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,240
Appellate me to some degree intrusion is
going to be inevitable alright I know

35
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,310
that there's some contention around that
I actually do agree with the concept

36
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:17,360
that we should be able to defend
networks and systems where it becomes

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,610
practically impossible I do think that
there are systems that you know you

38
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:27,130
reflect that I think however on the
whole enterprise systems and networks

39
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:33,160
are so complex that it is a very very
difficult task in from security vendor

40
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,630
Cedar Point which you know I represent
the fact of the matter is nobody's come

41
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:45,170
out with a silver corset and so on some
level I think that you know which are

42
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,609
organizations have adopted the
irrational now have it down to the

43
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,190
posture that intrusions are inevitable
they are going to happen and so what do

44
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,890
we want you to know what steps will
hardly steps to ensure that the

45
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:06,059
adversaries job is difficult as possible
for one of the big things is reducing

46
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,060
that awareness window reductions in
Spokane

47
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,400
arising from other organizations that
track trends in this area you'll see

48
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,310
that actually being rude to you but it's
still really hot we're still seeing you

49
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:30,830
know average response time in the
hundreds a day which you know that's a

50
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,280
very very long time

51
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,919
right-hander Syria clothes inside
network so basically if if they have

52
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,970
that kind of time to get into your
network or lateral that time her time so

53
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:50,680
they can basically execute on whatever
their plan to use your network very

54
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:59,780
easily so he is trying to repair it for
Windows possible that one of the

55
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:05,710
approaches that organizations are
adopting World War is the concept that

56
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:18,060
you know people were around four or five
certainly worked with a number of

57
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,620
organizations represented different
vendors are you space where you know the

58
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:29,010
approach has traditionally been this
idea you respond to a red light starts

59
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,890
blinking then something happened let's
go response and certainly you can't

60
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:40,030
ignore those red lights when the red
lights are blinking but organizations

61
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:45,549
that have increased their maturity level
understand that for those again for that

62
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:51,910
professional adversary that's trying to
get your networks you that individuals

63
00:05:51,910 --> 00:06:01,220
good you everything there it is it is
their goal in life is so you can't just

64
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:09,020
wait for that really is oftentimes too
late by the time interior house that is

65
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,810
probably too late to get at the damage
has already happened in the same is true

66
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,070
so with continuous hard as he takes the
posture that you do not appreciate

67
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:28,300
search for evidence that with either
support or deny that proposition and

68
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,970
quite honestly the hope of that activity
to pull quite your your hunters were his

69
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:39,630
situation is normal traffic they're
going to see a movie but that's good

70
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,310
because it gives you a big slide you
understand what is happening in the

71
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,980
environment on a normal basis

72
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:52,230
case in point for my systems and talking
to you

73
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:58,020
websites you write something that should
worry that something it's normal it's

74
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,880
happening all the time because we got
that part of the world and that's where

75
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,640
you know some of these applications or
where the banking and that's fine that's

76
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,520
not something we need to spend some time
working with the only way you understand

77
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,650
and you have a baseline

78
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:21,109
should look like going forward you
should have some hopefully have some

79
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:29,180
idea of what's normal and what is it and
how to spot as a novelist with a crop

80
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:38,540
and that's really 2012 that there's no
single method doing that but you know

81
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:46,450
it's crucial to view to being effective
at that continuous in this article does

82
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:54,640
security basis not sex ed universities
all the accidents that happen throughout

83
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,810
Thursday's here on time that's not to
say that you know there are indeed there

84
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,760
are 10 days you know the fact that
matter is you talk to any sense has

85
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,530
rents here they will tell you that you
know they don't have to reach that that

86
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:17,570
the package there's so many of our
abilities so many ways to really get

87
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:22,280
that sophisticated most times to get
into a network and so it really comes

88
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,030
down to you security basics of hygiene

89
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,960
you know you think of it like the
watertight doors on a sober right you

90
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,840
can't 51 networkers

91
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:42,810
magic cure is watertight doors are
suffering you don't have a single

92
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:47,140
watertight door they went to start
taking on water holes breach

93
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:53,060
they close it hey we're not going to see
a lot and there is a strategic places in

94
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,949
there for different reasons in the same
sure when we're addressing you know

95
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:08,050
things like hygiene basic Senior Buyer
catches two factor authentication a lot

96
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:16,030
of this back to where it was and you
know having the proper tools and proper

97
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:21,370
expertise you will understand what's on
your network that sounds so basic sound

98
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:27,310
so obviously that work do you really
know most enterprises are actually

99
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:35,810
surprised when they start work areas
realized we were running

100
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,610
five-year-old Cruz with some codes got
seventy bilities in it you know they

101
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:48,750
won't face and that's been running out
here or me and it's you a fireman that

102
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:55,520
they never expected to be connected to
their projects and so you know that's

103
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:04,800
one of those areas where then where do
these flying and the security basics and

104
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,910
it finally hit in this is where you have
to work your way up the majority said

105
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,199
not every organization and this level of
maturity but it is definitely something

106
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,450
that every organization should fire to
do that is to build it tell the operator

107
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:26,060
capability that the most brother then
threatened help comes from inside your

108
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,859
network there are some really awesome
threat in tow companies that have come

109
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,130
out in the last five to six years in
particular and they have some really

110
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,120
good information

111
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,890
but to be perfectly honest you know a
lot of cases what they're selling

112
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:47,150
releases data points there are some
organizations they have traded

113
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,170
intelligence and you know anybody would
like to discuss it afterwards you know

114
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,839
we can talk about that its kind outside
of this particular presentation but by

115
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:03,130
and large a lot of his what passes as an
Intel is really just information or

116
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,360
we're gonna try to talk about what this
data points are just a moment but I

117
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:15,240
thought a really interesting statistic
was at last the horizon I did reach

118
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,330
response report but most reason why they
showed only a three percent overlap

119
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:28,350
between providers do you think about
that for a minute there was only a three

120
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:34,860
percent difference between magazine's
first I mean that's huge

121
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,089
usually the differences between those
companies are you know they can be

122
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:45,260
measured as 347 different but only have
three percent overlap that shows there's

123
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,439
a wide margin

124
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,430
information is out there and other
things you to think about with providers

125
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:58,969
it's great that they have information
about its financial fraud operators

126
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:06,360
Belarus uses these particular schools
and I'm not saying that that is a good

127
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,440
information but the question is is it
relevant it relevant here and you know

128
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:20,800
relevant partners for immediate be
amazing toys which you know your

129
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:28,979
position right stocks have a lot of
noise so it just becomes more

130
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,990
information about the process that
doesn't really had a lot of valujet

131
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:41,890
doing but taxing the things that are
happening there is no more relevant and

132
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,830
tell them what's happening here

133
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:50,180
I mean completely relevant for this
happening to you now have correlations

134
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,430
with other campaigns that are happening
elsewhere

135
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:59,599
correlations and ask for some of these
dreading tell friends sharing websites

136
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,630
and things of that nature can really
come in handy but if you're not an

137
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:10,180
Information Agency she's very same
response plan is to just like the box

138
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:17,560
and move on and there's lots of
information and facts and its health

139
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:24,000
system and we're gonna talk about any
details as we go through this day

140
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,050
hopefully as that maturity scale that's
what process was fired two that's what

141
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:40,939
you should be moving and and it isn't
but the payoff is when you start to see

142
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:49,090
some of these things happening you start
to recognize that the ball and it gives

143
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:54,790
you a different perspective on how you
might describe that just simply white

144
00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:03,349
box and chances are really good that
adversaries got insurance and the box

145
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:09,010
you're aware of who's probably five or
ten others were not aware of just by

146
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:17,439
white box out haven't stopped them so
that leads us into what I was making

147
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:25,850
before data is not the same disease
Intel requires in order to create data

148
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:37,900
but what's important to you is the
analysis that you guys have fun size 3-5

149
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,569
will be available for download from the
highest safety but that's a quote from

150
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,560
the CIA documentary CIA

151
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:54,839
days it's basically defining when using
colleges and their information knowledge

152
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:02,390
about an adversary observation
investigation and now faces or so again

153
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:15,810
getting action during a bad there's
value in that is so fresh and so it's

154
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,930
all really is the analysis of that and
understanding how it actually you know

155
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:26,160
applies where doesn't apply to your
environment and the only way that you

156
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,160
really have gathered that is by
analyzing that and it is the best source

157
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,719
for Disease how really is inspired your
environment

158
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:48,180
talk about increasing the adversary
roots hakama incident response British

159
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,569
sorry twists and Cole what it is that we
need you and what we really need to be

160
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,460
very quickly is a review said exposure
renews that goes back to what we talked

161
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,750
about where he wants you identify that
this is happening as quickly as possible

162
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:10,930
then again reduced at voter window yet
that attackers minimal amount of it for

163
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:11,540
her

164
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:21,930
environment to be able to determine this
goes so goes back to when I met him

165
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:27,170
before we meet you quickly be able to
identify all of the affected systems

166
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,920
it's important when you have it here on
one system to be able to identify dances

167
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:44,750
there is tension compromise me you have
to be able to then be able to hand out a

168
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:50,680
lot of organizations just don't have the
expertise to be able to do that and

169
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,079
there are a lot of living good open
source tools they're out there that

170
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,760
allow you to see

171
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,880
commercials that are out there that
allows you that if anybody would like to

172
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,430
have a deeper discussion on what some of
those tools sets are happy to have that

173
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:11,040
discussion after after the presentation
but determining the scope is really

174
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,899
really important and it's easy to the
next good idea of limiting damage you

175
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,970
know if the stove with his usual once we
know what the scope of the impact these

176
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:26,050
were fired at it we have to deal with
the limit the damage and again this many

177
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:32,950
system there may be some way putting a
firewall rule in Europe River event that

178
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:39,750
researchers really is going to be
determined on a case-by-case basis but

179
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:47,940
you course needs in france you have to
make sure that you understand his before

180
00:17:47,940 --> 00:18:05,550
you attempt to start investigating so
there are in there are ways you it was

181
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:13,730
happening in terms of your exposure for
all rules different response that

182
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:19,140
there's still maintained those are back
and allow you to take a deeper look

183
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,870
what's happening on this end points in
order to gather that televisions in

184
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:32,649
order to gather those data points that
you use for your apology for us to be

185
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:39,650
able to review the decision would be
that the rejection thats right after

186
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,150
retrieval systems normal

187
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:48,710
completely expelling the environment but
it is also continuously monitoring this

188
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:54,530
is a professional adversary against
their job to get into your fire and so

189
00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:01,540
it's not enough simply to bail them out
of it because they will back so back to

190
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:07,789
this particular sort of process where we
had that continuous hunting

191
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:16,989
something of interest that needs to be
investigated is reliving the damage we

192
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:23,509
investigate gather that information and
then there's this constant search that

193
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:29,359
they go through that and then all of
this up to you you have any lessons

194
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:37,908
learnt the older five future attacks so
for instance you know that the adversary

195
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:48,570
that they are creating encrypted files
something along those lines here you can

196
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,950
put into place different tools or
different automated functions devil

197
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,619
looks for those and you're fired it and
when you spot them particularly if they

198
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:05,668
have unusual unusual babies unusual
locations that could lead you to that

199
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:15,009
need to be investigated voted again goes
back to that cyclical cycle where we

200
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:22,700
understand that they have someone what
happened from these tax so that we

201
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:32,749
retain information forward and we can
use that spot so then the question of

202
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:38,830
what did you eat less and ideally in a
recurring back to our our psyche analyst

203
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:44,489
here if we have the proper tools we have
the proper processes in place for

204
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:49,409
collecting the proper information you
know it goes for a situation where the

205
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:52,440
person is leading please now

206
00:20:52,440 --> 00:21:04,789
networks you never come out so just as
painful as possible for the adversary

207
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:13,190
this is the con- structed I mentioned
earlier on my talk where this is

208
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:19,050
referred to in this is a great tool for
understanding what the different levels

209
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:26,149
are a response what level of the
adversary and idea is to move up the

210
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:33,150
most places for that adversary or those
am series to change and to understand

211
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:40,840
you know where your careers where your
response processes you are in terms of

212
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,490
this maturity and hopefully you know
again get up to the top of this period

213
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,250
for your operating at the highest level
possible and this was actually created

214
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:55,610
by an individual happy Indian by the
name is David Bianco and what it doesn't

215
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:02,439
models from top to bottom with trivial
to change aspects of different syntax

216
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:12,720
malware or you know you will be
difficult with data at the bottom and it

217
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,880
ends with because in order to get to
that top tier talk about that in just a

218
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,420
minute

219
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:27,320
you know it takes more than just the
individual data on a different layers so

220
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:35,610
we look at the bottom layer has values
this is what a lot of refuse to my and

221
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:42,149
this is good information useful
information I can say that from an

222
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,450
operational standpoint this is also
something that most companies

223
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:51,910
organizations kind of struggle operation
get a list of passes then how do you go

224
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:56,180
out and look at all the disk drives in
the environment or look at all the right

225
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:03,050
processes environment identify whether
or not that some organizations are able

226
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:12,990
to do that there are some school year to
all of them very strongly that if your

227
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,340
best against a particular system

228
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,480
particular sample there certainly easy
come in high school

229
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,840
pretty much every platform in order to
generate a hat and then there are a

230
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,959
number of different can see along the
bottom Firestone

231
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:35,540
being probably the most well-known
foreign sources you used to determine

232
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:42,720
whether or not that hashes positive
thing I there are several benefits has

233
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,160
values in terms of being able to
identify whether or not just read it is

234
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:54,440
a very valuable tool but there are also
very significant limitations and need to

235
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,440
be understood so very

236
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:04,399
having a hash or really really low I
won't say it's impossible but it's

237
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,890
really really so if you get a trigger

238
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:16,830
chances are really good positive we're
just problematic is trivial change

239
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:24,720
absolutely so you know anybody in 10
year old kids how to access Google

240
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:33,840
create customized yes you will see you
change that has well and so there's a

241
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,980
really fast portrayed an idea that you
see the Packers are obvious gatien

242
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:49,380
schools format where he's not exactly
difficult to do anybody who has access

243
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:55,160
to Venice ploy and it's a great show for
all day long so you know something that

244
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:01,480
has never been seen before so porous
that has seen as benign even in cases

245
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:12,110
where it is so it can be a very valuable
to Dillards right that are there are

246
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:17,280
suspicious your environment for
certainly is it datapoint together what

247
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,170
should be your intelligence gathering
but but it does have some limitations

248
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:27,330
and and again it should be remembered
that invention

249
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:32,070
organizations kind of struggle with
operation so that's something that we're

250
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:40,679
looking at you when you're looking at
certain you know how would I wouldn t

251
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:49,220
hashes from aside from every borrower or
any number of different places and

252
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:56,170
actually operationalize that in mind he
can answer to that question is now you

253
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:01,670
really should ways and tools that have a
wide-scale

254
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:12,470
another layer IP addresses begin you
know this is a really good thing to be

255
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:18,300
able to trigger on you can find these
your firewall logs web server logs I

256
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:24,830
guess laws as a whole list of places
where you can identify these are the

257
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:36,350
problem is I hear dresses prom and bad
guys burn through them quickly

258
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:42,260
fast burn rate so unless something is
hard coded by unless something is hard

259
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:48,570
coded you they're attacking
infrastructure those in the burn rate on

260
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:55,460
IP address is very rare and pastry
tribute to use something like playing

261
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:02,440
for us age to be able to talk about
traffic through another location using

262
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,900
this was sort of the following us on
Twitter and other social media outlets

263
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:16,920
when something happened and not in any
way there are certain people who

264
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:22,240
question whether or not simply because
originated from north korea night he

265
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,340
doesn't necessarily mean north Korea
launches a very high I'm saying that

266
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:34,679
there was a tribute to be able to you

267
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:45,260
traffic through another IP and so while
this is this poll statistics there are

268
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:55,660
significant limitations for domain names
are the next layer here made in again

269
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:02,410
here are some useful and we start to get
you a little bit more you know

270
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:09,640
identifying some of the difficult to
change features an attack sequence of

271
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,780
you will depend on your part of what it
is that we're talking about it's very

272
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:19,230
easy to change and there was out
routines that are out there they

273
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:28,580
generate you know literally thousands
and so you know it's generates reached

274
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:36,399
my response we're seeing things then he
sure where they're using generated

275
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,980
domains it is very difficult it's almost
impossible

276
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:47,820
blacklist your firewall to be a few
isolated and there's also a fat burn

277
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:54,260
rate you can see here's where you would
actually find the lot of those artifacts

278
00:28:54,260 --> 00:29:04,240
history firewall DNS cache server logs
so are usually pretty surprised as to be

279
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:12,570
able to identify the overall back but
that's a browser just a laptop offers of

280
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:17,090
a laptop with operating outside the fire
and let's face it it's good but it did

281
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:23,730
you know can you actually pull browser
history that well if you don't have the

282
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:28,370
tools in place to be able to do that
something you want to explore looking at

283
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:32,840
different schools to be able to hold an
awful the browser is because in there

284
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,409
may not be something that would be your
proxy voting may not be something it

285
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:44,180
would be nice if we're on your side of
things to look for when you're looking

286
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:49,870
through these artifacts is a very
fractious would use

287
00:29:52,400 --> 00:30:03,330
the difference between what you doing to
me yes I politics that number one there

288
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:11,860
plan looks at that looks like it's the
surreal sights and yet a single

289
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:19,179
character like that changes into
thinking this is just received this

290
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:26,240
again there were forthright actors in
Russia had used this technique to make

291
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:35,290
sure that your e-mail that makes their
work erecting machine out into what

292
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:40,149
appear to be legitimate government or
military sites in reality what they've

293
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:47,190
done to me they changed the spelling one
cares her characters he said of it and

294
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:59,240
they had it and and for middle it was
our service you look at it and it looks

295
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,800
like there is one of those things and
just sort of tricks doing something

296
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:13,480
that's the OpenDNS are you ready for
some of the things they're doing

297
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:20,540
transporting shoe they had a brief
presentation here and immature online

298
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:27,750
that crashing now ask what they did was
they were actually able to use the pros

299
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:33,060
with the frequency and time to live
there was a whole long list

300
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:39,530
artifacts they looked at to determine
whether or not he'd only with armed

301
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:45,020
militias not whether or not it's going
to be malicious but has never been seen

302
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,050
before it's never been used before it
never seeing on your firewall they can

303
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,490
predict with writing actors whether or
not that

304
00:31:53,490 --> 00:32:01,030
days old this course there's a number of
different sources

305
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:09,590
whether or not they're being sketchy
information you're seeing systems that

306
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:17,428
are acting over usual or or or believe
it or not there was one of us right hand

307
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:21,980
along time ago rather work for a
different company and we were doing a

308
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:38,609
POC started looking at your traffic is
going to carry fits into the reasons as

309
00:32:38,609 --> 00:33:04,509
we approach giving it your network
studio to change hashes turnover change

310
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:18,869
IP addresses trivial changed it means
but it's still speech there but anyway

311
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:29,519
how they operate and artifacts some of
these artifacts

312
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:45,830
very very good or bad guys you change so
few texts or so we're in memory is a lot

313
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:54,460
of fire whether or not now we're sorry
bro that's one of the ways that bad guys

314
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,400
understand we're not premised

315
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:08,159
or reading text whether that systems are
compromised and situations that's

316
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,350
something that would be very difficult
for them to recode that attacks all

317
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:20,980
around it a lot of really good
information about the church Trojans and

318
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:31,360
sometimes it does can see you know some
of the ways to identify his were

319
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:38,750
operationalized stacking frequency
analysis looking for suspected it runs

320
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:46,168
very effective means of identifying the
collected information future use

321
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:57,860
giving schools that's where we started
moving to where specific attackers

322
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:10,410
specific mention it raw files for
instance in 05 and because of that

323
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:16,160
they're lazy so they tend to use the
same things over to review or something

324
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,399
is working why would you change so in
this case what we're looking at or just

325
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:41,190
a certain type of community chargers for
structure to use attacks me web self and

326
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,660
other tools and things of that nature so
if you start to see some things again

327
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:53,759
and again with different reasons that
this is the same attack a very different

328
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:05,600
approach to getting our factories and
again indicators are rare these

329
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,190
different things and we look for these

330
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:15,240
particular areas which is very very
difficult for the adversaries change and

331
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:29,189
it makes it easier to be able to spot in
there so this is where it's very very

332
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:41,260
difficult so that the attack in some
cases the window size you know what was

333
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:46,160
the what was so languished for answers
to some of the things some of the

334
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,970
attribution it was done with white
papers where the localization various

335
00:36:51,970 --> 00:37:01,000
statues certain Asian country's foremost
thing for Asians media particularly

336
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:09,410
hungry operation lateral movement scary
techniques they used to save and share

337
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:17,368
their lateral root thing that again very
very difficult for them changed macy's

338
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:22,450
has the following we're all in the same
techniques over and over and over again

339
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:32,509
as they enter into these networks and
this is where the ultimate goal but to

340
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:36,569
be perfectly frank operations have this
level of operational maturity this is

341
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:46,569
where third-party commercial friend and
tell content and that's that Intel based

342
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:53,640
upon so better understand it or not

343
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:25,750
so bility there's more haitians five
potentially the same family and so if

344
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:32,170
you see for instance particular hash
values associated with particular tony

345
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:38,630
is associated with associated with
particular filtration techniques you

346
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:43,680
know you can then they'll different
indicators of compromise or artifacts

347
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,419
with told you have here to identify when
this is happening and different segments

348
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:56,350
of that or modify which team will you
still have a much higher accuracy rate

349
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:03,150
in terms of identifying where
potentially new so the wage hike

350
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:08,250
mentioned with any fears if you're not
ingesting IOC

351
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,000
something better number of different
sources for that and again

352
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:18,290
racially motivated crimes should be
trying to aspired to get to a place

353
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:23,580
where they can operationalize indicators
compromise directly out of there there's

354
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:33,630
a number of their friends and for this
most notably open IOC or six Yara Yara

355
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:40,380
is great but it's a process-oriented it
was much more limited terms of what we

356
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:48,110
can identify over 90 °c define what
seemed like every single we're talking

357
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:57,130
about here you can see the question is
how your operation out there that will

358
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:02,160
allow you to do this on a single system
basis there's a number of regional

359
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:13,349
single system basis of the enterprises
restarting again outside around this

360
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:20,900
particular sales talk but if you want to
talk about ways that we work with you

361
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:29,270
know operationalize I was seized that
certain something deep dive announces it

362
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:37,480
again now we're looking at you know
you'll never be compromised systems that

363
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:43,290
have been called the campaign and
there's a whole different artifacts that

364
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:50,820
are available the Greens we've got the
right crosses the network connection

365
00:40:50,820 --> 00:41:05,589
different handle that handles texts go
through the whole list total tax areas

366
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:17,290
where you get this information from his
regions with capabilities understand

367
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:25,339
when you see this and then once you
reach that point for operationalizing it

368
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:33,259
then becomes much easier when there's no
light blinks first and that bad guys

369
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:39,380
gonna do everything possible not to trip
you up and probably one of the most

370
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:47,560
effective meant that most responders
that I've worked with your feedback on

371
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,380
this whole process

372
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:55,770
hunting and data stacking and we're
looking for looking across all of your

373
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:00,210
host here this is where you really start
getting to you unless you're somebody

374
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:09,030
really just absolute God can create
things for yourself and if you can I

375
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,150
would recommend the right holiday season

376
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:20,470
there's a lot of good commercial sold
out there that will allow you to do this

377
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:27,000
and that's where you start really
getting to me start looking for those

378
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,039
outlines looking for those persistence
and shit out of 20,000 system only seen

379
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:41,609
only on this number it's got a
particular program that a group of

380
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:42,750
people

381
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:50,029
master boot record and should lead
against cyclical cycle talk about

382
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:56,140
understanding the basic understanding
and the only way to do that

383
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:04,390
capabilities hiring process for this
type of treatment and you know by now

384
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:14,368
and not very take me is it's a legit and
service associate director should never

385
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:23,450
be running for help protect you just
look at a school system it appears that

386
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:34,288
the reality you know but do keep
challenges this is the most organization

387
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:45,079
is this ability to easily search think
about being able to 2000 system

388
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:52,680
daunting task and so again if your
organization has not been position to be

389
00:43:52,680 --> 00:44:00,490
able to do that today they think about
how we were raised that I can use my

390
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:01,759
bosses

391
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,040
fish
