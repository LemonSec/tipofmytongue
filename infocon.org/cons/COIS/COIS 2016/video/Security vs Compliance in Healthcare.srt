1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,859
wedding welcome to talk about security
forces compliant in health care

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,910
first is a general disclaimer views and
opinions are my own and not those of my

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:25,320
past curtain or post apocalyptic
employers just a general review of one

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,308
of their talk about mainly involves the
use shared with those accounts in

5
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:38,530
medical facilities and risks that come
with that and what can be done to

6
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:46,030
mitigate those risks while still
maintaining ease of access to medical

7
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,510
environment that is very important that
you know doctors nurses and whoever they

8
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,820
need to access that can access the
system very quickly

9
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:13,040
my background and what kind of inspired
me to give this talk which is why am I

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,610
work primarily as a defender Antonio
Morales very very much on the defensive

11
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:28,080
side of things I haven't WP interesting
professionally but I do think a lot

12
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,539
about the offensive side of things
because that's how do you have you have

13
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:44,040
to do is defend you have to know how to
attack so as I go and medical centers

14
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,770
and soon as the AC and unmark machine my
criminal mind kicks in and I think oh

15
00:01:51,770 --> 00:02:00,390
things somebody could do with those kind
of giving the inspiration for this type

16
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:10,360
and so whenever you go to a doctor's
office or hospital

17
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:19,600
chances are you see a situation like
this where he was seen in the doctor's

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:28,430
office there is sitting unlocked when
does sessions logged in but the medical

19
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,770
program is in that session is locked

20
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,160
that that particular medical program
that's running right now is I think the

21
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,370
most popular in the United States that's
hyperspace by Epic Systems and you

22
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,420
probably can't tell when the picture but
what it's showing on the machine retail

23
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,100
is a method that this session is secure

24
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,760
to remarry

25
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,989
reassuring message ok you know I help
professional and quick secure but I'm

26
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:14,049
good and that situation is so common I
felt that if you google computer in exam

27
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:27,070
room that's what will come up when you
visited doctor or specialist especially

28
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:32,410
your writing going to be sitting in an
exam room alone with that computer

29
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:40,430
private I'm actually took me a long time
to find any kind of study that looked

30
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,560
exactly how long from when animals a
room alone I double other studies that

31
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,709
examined the overall time that Putin's

32
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,170
in an appointment and what can be done
become a speed that up but that was the

33
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,030
only study then I found very big butt

34
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:06,319
anecdotally based on my experience going
with different special risks talking

35
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:13,500
with our perform their way that matter
but pretty well you can sample size on

36
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:25,090
the study was marred they would apply to
the so how can someone attacked this

37
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,719
machine when they've got that much time
on their hands and I talked to your pen

38
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,610
testing but if you're somebody here at
the conference and you know tell that to

39
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:44,370
happen our own machine what would you do
with all kinds of different ways that

40
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,700
they can attack the machines they have
physical access to systems are marked it

41
00:04:49,700 --> 00:05:02,669
logged in and so you know the most
obvious things where people could just

42
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,700
be messing with machine that because
their record better you're trying to

43
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:14,030
hack into things could just be because
they're brought I talked to people I

44
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:19,960
know about this talk just trying to be a
general feedback on what people outside

45
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,640
batf you think about this topic and I
was really shocked when one person is

46
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,620
talking to the like are you hope they
leave the metals and I like to get in

47
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:37,710
there through their writing about me and
I G and then you know I find out that

48
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,810
these things P systems often have
completely unfettered access to the

49
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,650
internet so chances are there probably
is somebody who isn't there

50
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:55,900
get really bored and just start browsing
through been you open yourself up to

51
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:01,000
potentially drive-by attacks when you
know someone just trying to pass the

52
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,080
time they're bored

53
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,310
and they don't see anything wrong with
what they're doing because the medical

54
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:12,599
record programs locked hopefully the
best another situation where they'd be

55
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:20,199
content with that can still cause major
problems with bright drive-by attacks

56
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,810
ransomware fake antivirus that kinda
thing that exploits the border with four

57
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,789
games to play with your organization has
at some point in that systems existence

58
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:42,979
and talk to people in the medical
industry trying to get their feel for ok

59
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:51,199
if I'm telling you it's pretty easy
what's your reaction to this issue as a

60
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,560
non-technical person but as someone in
health care who's you know kind of

61
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:07,779
managing these records and talk to me
why would someone do that so I when I

62
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:11,039
realized I have to go back to my top
down and that a slide

63
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:20,839
why would someone do that and you know
there's all kinds of different things

64
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:28,650
that you can do with this information
you could just be because your nose in

65
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,960
your went to poke around and see what
else is going on with you or with

66
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,888
somebody else it could be because you
have a personal grudge against somebody

67
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:44,599
you find that they had some medical
conditions that may be there wrote in

68
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:45,800
her significant other

69
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:55,810
find out or do you cert falsifying and
if that you can do that all easily

70
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,620
without malware without me damn thing if
they don't bother to lock the medical

71
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:07,539
record program emphasizes rocking the
medical record program does nothing

72
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:11,810
really to deter an attack her with

73
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:18,060
a decent level of technical moans didn't
have to be anything too sophisticated or

74
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:25,460
crazy and as we've seen at the
healthcare industry is being attacked

75
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:32,380
more and more for various reasons some
of them opportunistic some of them not

76
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:45,320
for example with the the opium hacks you
saw major health insurers right after

77
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:56,320
opium by many reports claim is the same
work very closely related groups so we

78
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,450
kind of group wisdom is that these
attackers are creating a huge database

79
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:09,270
on people with clearances and other
sensitive roles so you take their

80
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:16,610
background investigation you take all
their hope so now you know who maybe has

81
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:24,839
a lot of medical bet you know if you
were to conduct espionage that's

82
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:31,980
extremely valuable the only person in
the town of medical that we can offer to

83
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,930
make that go away we compare

84
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:40,949
maybe just something with us or you know
maybe we can both defy their records or

85
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,870
find something that they don't want
explosive the world and blackmail works

86
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:52,500
toward them so there's a bunch of things
you can do with medical records and so

87
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,060
how you know it's not just health care

88
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,279
Kyocera part of i'm talking about health
care specifically because

89
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:10,920
I see this problem frequently and over
the years it never has seemed to be

90
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:17,560
gotten better and there's a network
defender that that bothers me but he

91
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,748
also count are not unique to health care
at all there are tons of industries that

92
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:29,139
account YouTube account system accounts
whatever the key difference with

93
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:38,959
healthcare is most of the other systems
are facing the public if you've got a

94
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:46,819
machine in a warehouse that's got a
kiosk account for example or pharmacy or

95
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:51,248
something like that that's at least
behind the desperate locked or something

96
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:57,559
like that with a medical center or
doctor's office I could just make an

97
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:07,069
appointment with whatever Dr 102 get a
referral to whatever doctor and and and

98
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:13,639
I'm home with a computer for 30 minutes
so that's what makes health care you

99
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:23,240
need when compared to these other
industries and let's talk about

100
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,709
exceptions because a lot of times
organizations will have policies that

101
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:35,469
things like should accounts are
discouraged or you know shared accounts

102
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:41,660
we you know we should invest practice
tonight you sure to count and then you

103
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,120
put in an exception because the staff
will be able to access $30 right now

104
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,639
anywhere anytime and get better at the
hospital for medical center

105
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:01,509
second count we were I did you have a
schedule or you're dealing with a

106
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:03,360
medical emergency

107
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,060
you know timing is important but
thinking back to the CIA try and

108
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:18,248
industry seems to be almost 100% focused
on availability and company share data

109
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:31,009
integrity of the data so when the
emphasize is that are shared accounts

110
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:40,209
provide no accountability and to
continue the talk with CIA trying if you

111
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:46,699
cannot trust integrity of your systems
and your records there being a few

112
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:54,258
stories that the media reports of
employees stealing medical record a turd

113
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:59,680
doing something nefarious with medical
record deal and when I would Smith to

114
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:08,620
you is how can you be sure to log that
you have a medical record systems if

115
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:17,309
anybody can go in and run a keylogger
and I have tried to but it missed out

116
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:24,309
various different ways that I thought it
would be held in Packer game install

117
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:29,680
malware on a system that unlocked
whether it's health care kiosk warehouse

118
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,599
kiosk whatever depending on what
controls you have a place it could be

119
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,050
something as simple as downloading the
next keeping the Etsy or keep that

120
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:45,649
application whitelisting in place I can
run up PowerShell scripts because

121
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:50,980
PowerShell part of Windows you can do
all kinds of crazy powerful stops and I

122
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:58,189
could do with the USB rubber ducky that
the new research on because if you block

123
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:03,899
USD the USB rubber ducky is a virtual
keyboard which will dont the script

124
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:13,170
22 a file as as if it were keyboard
typing so you're blocking frustrates ok

125
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,769
great but this is the keyboard that
looks like a flash drive that scripted

126
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:25,100
I'm running it and in bed or two and a
half minutes I've got a script that can

127
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,360
start taking screenshots and modern okie
logs of your Citrix session yet whether

128
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:42,069
I want and but having a block windows
session would prevent that so with that

129
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:48,910
in mind let's talk about countermeasures
and talk about how we can actually bring

130
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:54,199
back that balance about three atriz
provide more confidentiality and

131
00:14:54,199 --> 00:15:01,709
integrity while maintaining that either
Texas you to access that is essential in

132
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:10,729
health care so we have some current
authentication options

133
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:18,119
your passwords are terrible for the
Kings who works for a rather different

134
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:23,660
application health care is not one of
them because you know doctors and nurses

135
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,290
go from room to room became very systems
throughout their day throughout their

136
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:34,399
rounds who's gonna have to enter raining
Boehner look at a text message every

137
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:42,429
every 30 minutes to drive you mad same
thing with RSA token still waiting for

138
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:47,529
that token to cyclic it's about to
expire and then what if the token get

139
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:52,410
that its think not to mention RSA tokens
are incredibly expensive when you're

140
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,260
trying to do

141
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:59,220
large print your paper the hardware
keyboard be properly think the server

142
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,630
stand up to new servers and that's an
increase you know people using

143
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:15,400
biometrics words with a solution before
RFID became popular biometric popular

144
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:21,350
until I realized that biometrics aren't
so great when you're constantly washing

145
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,010
your hands like they do in the medical
field lots and lots of clothes positive

146
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:33,439
and sees me postal both negative which
which causes lots of aggravation and

147
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,740
rightfully so

148
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:42,080
for the healthcare professionals so that
leaves pretty much only one option that

149
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,940
i could think of and that's smart cards
and there's lots in months advantages to

150
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:56,620
using smart cards also known as tax
depending on if you have experience in

151
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,240
the government may have different terms
for this kind of standard that the

152
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,970
government help to develop and
governments across all federal agencies

153
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:11,579
since it was mandated idly by executive
order in about 2005 so this is a very

154
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:17,680
mature technology it's been deployed to
very very large enterprise networks and

155
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:34,810
it works really well because you have
smart card in the in the keyboard if you

156
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:39,830
get a keyboard reader that works well
because you can use the smart card as

157
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:49,510
your idea badge so you can have a smart
card with regular RFID on it they can

158
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:55,020
use for four door access and that kind
of thing but it can also be used for

159
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,570
authenticating to the computer and the
reason

160
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:05,080
I'm suggesting contact smart cards
instead of contact with RFID smart cards

161
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,168
that will block with a perscription
there like that where doctors who use

162
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:16,000
that as their second factor for issuing
prescriptions for a couple reasons the

163
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,389
image of the Contact Card we have to
physically in the reader is it can be

164
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:27,469
configured such that through GPO so that
when you remove the card the system's

165
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,179
totally walked off so many who have
separate accounts for everything when

166
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:37,500
your employees tied to their I D type of
their smart card in order to go to the

167
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:43,100
next system they have to pull that card
in total you log the system out to worry

168
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,259
about the system rockingham and somebody
not being a block but you also have to

169
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:55,259
worry about having that totally unlocked
window session that anybody could just

170
00:18:55,259 --> 00:19:04,639
play around and it is it's really hard
to lose your ID be because their faces

171
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:10,740
staring back at you as you type in and
for me when I work for the defense

172
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:17,620
department it became reflex just go in
and pull that card to the point where

173
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:23,809
when I got into organizations that use
these kinds of authentication that's why

174
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:32,720
I would just kind of reflect oh yeah we
know that you know but it works really

175
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:41,669
really well it can be complicated to set
up if you don't have a good PKI system

176
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:51,100
in place however there are really good
managed PKI services particularly

177
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,809
the organization that i work with one of
them used a semantic in the process with

178
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:03,090
incredibly slick and agree with your IDM
and service now and I'm truly grateful

179
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,889
bunch of other things and will issue
certificates for you it will have to be

180
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:16,110
entire lifecycle from location Twitter
us and because symantec is a recognized

181
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:21,209
yay instead of having your own internal
CIA your certificates will be recognized

182
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,429
by other entities so they can be used
for example s mind signed and encrypted

183
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:36,149
email to other organizations that do to
you beyond just session authentication

184
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:42,779
you can used to authenticate 22 your
internal mobile app through internet new

185
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:46,740
single sign-on for just about anything
and in addition to the email

186
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:57,909
communication piece of the basic things
you know restrict removable media that

187
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:05,250
won't help with the USB rubber duckies I
mention but why make it easier on the

188
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:12,620
attacker if you can help it keep systems
physically away so but it it's much more

189
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:19,279
difficult for someone to reach most of
the medical facility that I've been in

190
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:24,179
don't have been the system just mounted
a new desk were drunk and immediately

191
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:29,559
like every other modern computer even if
it's a thing quiet then USB ports right

192
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:38,678
in the front thank you to keep that
system I somehow walked up for an

193
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,620
account under some sort of physical
security controls around that system

194
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,020
definitely does help to

195
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:52,320
application whitelisting again a
powershell script could get around this

196
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,780
but it also help prevent large number of
attack when I'm trying to say here is

197
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,680
there is no magic bullet you gonna have
to do defense in depth to secure this

198
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:10,430
system and use a series of control but
once you get these controls in place you

199
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:17,200
have a very very secure kiosk and most
of these have health care systems are

200
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:24,110
key off systems they're basically meant
to run one or two applications so if you

201
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:32,990
know the application windows up Parker
can automatically inventory all be

202
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,630
applications over the system you can use
a known good system and then pushed out

203
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:48,230
by a GPO and apply it makes you should
be able to execute any random sex scene

204
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,470
they started downloading freeware sites
or something that your web proxy mister

205
00:22:53,470 --> 00:23:01,330
path to download and run random
installers though the thing with

206
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,399
application whitelisting that sometimes
news

207
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:16,070
listing does not protect against
exploits because the experts brother

208
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,460
export from things like that will run
under the context of the browser or the

209
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,480
Office program or whatever application
they're running so they may not spawn a

210
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,750
new process exact same way be up with me
and expecting and it won't be blocked

211
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:43,020
for example Citrix 45 applications

212
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:50,320
and citric sessions can actually be
vulnerable to web compromises even if

213
00:23:50,320 --> 00:24:00,070
you have been executed because it's
running in the context of the brother so

214
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:04,340
restricting Internet communication so
they're couple different ways to go

215
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,280
about doing this

216
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,920
depending on what your organization is
comfortable with some organizations are

217
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:18,350
leveraging next-generation firewall
power out unlike what you don't get

218
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,840
anything particularly fancy

219
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:36,000
to design your security controls well
does your medical record really need to

220
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,460
access the internet for anything other
then web browsing and your internal

221
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:51,980
probably not restricted so that just
your web proxy and no external email her

222
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,620
way back

223
00:24:52,620 --> 00:25:00,439
go out and you could have lots of
organizations are now using video to

224
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,870
deploy their in charge systems and
honestly I'm I'm not sure what the

225
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:13,060
advantages of deploying your client over
it a Citrix application with a client

226
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:20,810
box that you've got sitting up somewhere
anyway but if you turn that around where

227
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:28,750
instead of virtualizing the medical
record Upper Canyon a browser that in

228
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:35,780
Citrix that people can use to access to
access public Internet and then you

229
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,379
restrict the actual browser on the
system to just your internet that mean

230
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:47,840
that they can you use that virtualized
browser to do the unsafe browsing the

231
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,139
Internet at large

232
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:56,470
so it does get compromised all baked
compromise with the virtual machine

233
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:03,790
fashion they didn't compromise the
system that actually running the EHR or

234
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:12,649
other sensitive programs and so some
other critical controls I am a huge fan

235
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:19,260
of Microsoft and they may have heard
recent publication that they can be used

236
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:27,150
to attack and it came out right as soon
as Microsoft pets do in burdened by 53

237
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:30,150
about that anymore and also with version
5

238
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:37,760
they created PPO's so you can centrally
managed in the policies and you also may

239
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,190
have heard that breaks applications but
by two if you leave the settings at

240
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:47,790
DePaul and import the recommended
profiles in that will only provide

241
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:52,340
additional applique additional
protection to the applications that are

242
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:58,060
most frequently targeted that it knows
how to protect for example Drogba Adobe

243
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:04,060
Reader office products your browser's
those sorts of things so if you just

244
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,030
leave it the default and don't turn up
to 11 which I still would recommend

245
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:13,840
trying to digital security protections
but women should not drink applications

246
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,330
even legacy applications with its
default setting and Microsoft is really

247
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:26,740
used for user guide for later versions
for deployment details some other good

248
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:36,090
control is a multi-factor authentication
anytime you have a system that can be

249
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:41,639
accessed remotely such as your webmail
there are attackers out there who will

250
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:48,630
look for organizations to have one
members of users such as schools various

251
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,730
enterprises

252
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:56,500
and have open public access webmail with
single factor authentication because all

253
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:03,220
they have to do is send out this really
looking for Mrs hey righty we update

254
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,400
your password

255
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,200
they steal passwords from the pitching
for and varying quality they will

256
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,090
probably find someone in the
organization who want them about four

257
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:17,639
and a lot of these attackers they don't
care who it is they did they just get an

258
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,540
account that can access webmail they can
spew out there

259
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:30,020
519 scams whatever is there when you out
and next thing you know my end up on a

260
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,020
million block west or at the very least
might damage organization's reputation

261
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:39,000
that's the minimum of what people can do
with publicly accessible web service

262
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,560
since they can do a whole lot more if
you have single factor authentication

263
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:49,570
Citrix for example now they've got a for
computing social on your network so

264
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:58,110
think about what services you got there
are probably extremely easy still in a

265
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:05,179
way that it still have a good I P Es in
Placer County is open source you can

266
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:10,380
have an open source was built in the
commercial rule set from emerging

267
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:19,630
threats is extremely cheap as security
so that may be something worth looking

268
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,060
into

269
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:26,730
to your antivirus I hear ya mean that
goes along on a time bomb various

270
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:33,900
vendors saying a few dead it's not dead
just can't depend on how to block a

271
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,930
hundred percent of every things like you
can't depend on any control control to

272
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,910
do that

273
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,110
tuning it

274
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:46,399
major in human terms have pretty good
heuristics they're just not turned on

275
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,530
and turned up by defaults 00 around the
booths selling see how high you can

276
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:59,059
without breaking things and I think
you'll be surprised that it's going to

277
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:07,750
be extremely rare or never if things
break when you do that so the next big

278
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:15,190
trend by touchstone this little bit is
media and I've seen a lot of medical

279
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:21,929
organization who will deploy very
sensitive applications and likes it

280
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:28,830
wraps or Citrix desktops I saw one
organization who actually deployed

281
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:36,139
windows 7 Citrix session running epic
but the hopes to sell that was marking

282
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:45,809
on the Citrix with Windows XP so if I
can compromise the host is really like

283
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:51,000
answer key logging on Citrix Systems I
can third taking screenshots and keep

284
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:01,299
doing whatever I want to do to the horse
that connect to Citrix and and spy on

285
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:10,700
that just like I would grow packaging
severely I doesn't provide you with

286
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:16,010
additional protection but it does help
like an earlier for browsing activities

287
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:21,799
and things that are untrusted unsafe in
Thunderbird realizing things that are

288
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:36,418
sensitive like you are so in conclusion
right now from what I've seen most of

289
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:41,410
the controls in the risk of pressure and
multi-factor are focused on electronic

290
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,580
prescription because thats whats
mandated by law

291
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:51,190
and it's mostly focused around
protecting guns prescription fraud but

292
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:57,539
as a patient i cant much much more about
the confidentiality integrity and

293
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:05,049
availability of my medical records I
really cannot think of anything that is

294
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:12,668
more personal to me more important to me
to my health safety and privacy in my

295
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:21,529
records and as a security professional I
would like to see those well protected

296
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:30,360
and I understand the needs of hospitals
and things that change takes time

297
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,959
especially something of major ass ok now
you will have separate accounts and you

298
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:44,659
gotta use this thing called a smart card
and a big change but when I would

299
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:57,019
emphasize to managers and department is
if you had a root for anybody it's not a

300
00:32:57,019 --> 00:33:06,690
matter of if it's memorable win
everything from the same account how can

301
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,110
you know which employs

302
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:15,229
was the one that creek bed officially
start that data which system was

303
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:22,419
involved with user account if you
occasionally occur in the investigator

304
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:26,399
no matter what outside service you hire
they're going to have their work cut out

305
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,699
for them

306
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:34,620
for that reason whereas if you have
separate accounts you've met eliminating

307
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:41,820
the bed extremely possible deniability
of you know we've got your your epic

308
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,200
drugs for example that thing you access
this page in this patient this patient

309
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:54,870
record if I'm a defense attorney and you
know I'm sitting there thinking well if

310
00:33:54,870 --> 00:34:03,139
I can go up to any system installed and
Mike Ryan is on at least five different

311
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:13,210
systems of a walking around examined
exam room as a prosecution you disprove

312
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:18,859
that there is not a trojan or some kind
of malware they could be stealing

313
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:24,190
passwords on any one of these machine
that's it's next to impossible and it's

314
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:32,730
extremely plausible deniability so
managers are wondering why it is this is

315
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:39,800
a good idea even just a matter of
perspective a British perspective having

316
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,040
serious counts is the harassment by most
powerful one of their first few role

317
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:59,009
right now would it be 1230 accountants
system account will not be used in the

318
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:04,500
of course their poems an exception but
there really shouldn't be because there

319
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,599
are solutions

320
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:12,260
smart cards very quick access to systems
you can make Windows logon really

321
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,359
cricket you turn your Windows desktop
right and you'll have your car program

322
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,520
automatically start that kind of thing
so you can still maintain that either

323
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:28,200
back visit spinning back fist and give
everybody a little bit more security in

324
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:33,770
the process from India and here's my

325
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:42,509
reference to that one study if you're
interested in and then the time the

326
00:35:42,509 --> 00:36:30,660
patient's been in an appointment with
any questions right when I am talking

327
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:36,859
isn't the kind of breach that thing
happening maybe been coming from outside

328
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:42,150
engine networks in the mostly been
opportunistic attacks mostly they

329
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,799
haven't been targeted attacks they've
just been you know fine financially

330
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:53,180
motivated attackers and gotten lucky and
targeted a large organization like where

331
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:58,890
this is more about with someone being on
the inside with its patient doctor

332
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:03,460
whatever Mb knows you manipulated record
but yeah but that transition I think

333
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:09,609
would take time because you know the
doctors and nurses are used to him to go

334
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:14,769
up whenever system may want and just be
able to open up in many cases in

335
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:20,808
civilian just do things and then used to
doing that for years and now the news

336
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:24,680
they know you got this new plant the
idea badge and use what you do you have

337
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:30,868
a pen you login it's really not that
much additional effort but because it's

338
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:33,869
so new and people have been doing it for
so long

339
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,590
nothin but a few but in general in
ninety whenever you have that kind of

340
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:45,180
situation there's going to be a little
computer pushed back so explain to

341
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:51,680
people why this needs to be done I i
think is important and PKI can be

342
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,899
incredibly complicated a few
organizations not used to dealing with

343
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,310
certificate issue in summer vacations
and management lifecycle that's why

344
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:03,440
these the card services like Symantec

345
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,700
PKI can be reused and help you take your
clothes off I talked with couple

346
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,540
colleagues who used to work for
hospitals and one brother two very good

347
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:23,060
point which is who pays for this and i
can reply came up with no idea if this

348
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:27,270
would work in practice because I can
send it I never worked for a hospital

349
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:39,130
myself but I IMG badges on normal realm
of security and access control might

350
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:47,890
suggest them again practical resist is
physical security to pay for the smart

351
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:53,410
cards themselves I T or whoever manages
your desktop to retro Department

352
00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:02,220
the reader the Reader keyboards and the
weather PKI solutions whether internal

353
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,580
or external

354
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:08,759
they manage all these software controls
and you can get smart cards with RFID on

355
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,990
them so they work with your existing
physical access controls are magnetic

356
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:18,379
stripe or whatever it is you're you so
they can be kind of a bad and just kind

357
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,940
of fit into your regular that just
hearing process is the best way to do

358
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,010
that with a reorganization that known as
smart cards do they have kind of 192 Lal

359
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:33,270
and it's just their regular badge issue
in process is a smarter

360
00:39:36,430 --> 00:40:16,790
part of my reason for giving the stock
is I think security is security is kind

361
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:24,020
of on the back burner medical personal
and no way should be security is

362
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,500
everybody's responsibility but I don't
expect a doctor or nurse know the

363
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:35,450
information security I don't think most
patients or doctors or nurses or anybody

364
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:41,620
involved recognizes that the number of
computer and that extremely huge

365
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,799
security problem

366
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:49,290
up when it up to my doctors and nurses
as a patient and their response was over

367
00:40:49,290 --> 00:41:05,340
I should leave your home with the
computer right absolutely and I think it

368
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:12,230
more patients were aware of it like
heard this talk if I were a non 990

369
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:16,170
security person and I'm telling somebody
I can start spying on your medical

370
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:20,880
records in two and a half minutes at the
majority of hospitals I would be saying

371
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,100
to my health care operator what he was
doing about this but I think it's

372
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:31,259
because that you know I care I T has
just been done the same way for so long

373
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:37,379
a messenger in ninety whether the
patient or in

374
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:44,100
or health care provider that doesn't
really crossed their minds and even when

375
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:49,580
it does when I talk to doctors nursing
about this reaction I get our why would

376
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:54,440
anyone do that and my paper ones that
make people mad

377
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:05,950
discussing this you know you know you're
talking about how easy it is to get him

378
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:13,480
to do things and it's like that but I'm
talking about this risk I had a doctor

379
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:20,230
tom has met its like what would make me
mad at the patient is finding out there

380
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:24,330
the data breach because someone was
browsing through Facebook game and go

381
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:30,420
home with a flashing on and now every
single subsequent doctor nurse who has

382
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,619
their credential store and bipolar or
something like that that just drives me

383
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:39,670
insane so I just think there needs to be
a wider education and awareness of this

384
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:45,770
whole issue from across the spectrum
from patients and doctors and management

385
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:54,660
and whoever took them all together and
realize this is an important issue it's

386
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,440
only is to me as somebody with chronic
health problems

387
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,869
goes into a bunch of different medical
facilities and I see the same thing

388
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:08,040
happened every single one and I really
don't know you know how to bring that up

389
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:17,540
so bring it up to my you know
practitioners and it is you know

390
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:44,319
actually hopefully operates and
practical solution does have been

391
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:51,849
implemented for years now for over a
decade now it's a very well understood

392
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:56,660
standard smart cards are if you use
something like a crowd PKI service like

393
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:03,828
your federal government will trust your
certs 4 producer Mike food murder vol

394
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:09,630
with variants health care agency the
federal government nor signatures for

395
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,059
companies that are interested

396
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:18,690
PKI breeds kinds of us might affect
benefits to having this kind to you

397
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:24,869
through the walk the positive and
negative campaigning and after that you

398
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:48,369
get a lot of good benefits for security
and for a just general communication a

399
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:56,670
really really good question and I and
not just health care if it is it

400
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:06,930
regulated doesn't happen but I am Not
sure I a hundred percent plus group of

401
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:12,169
politicians who may not be that
tech-savvy to do it right and not make

402
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:16,200
it overly burdensome and just have it as
a mandate from her

403
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:24,200
without any put without either without
without enough detail or too much detail

404
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:36,109
where it's very very rigid or $0.02 tell
you should do that thing did you he does

405
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:45,348
have a message directly via the point of
lying to you I think this really needs

406
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:49,619
to be a private sector kinda push I'm
just not sure how to get there

407
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:30,430
rescinded really percent you know PCI is
also regulated of the payment card

408
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:35,500
industry I think there are mostly to be
some sort of health care consortium put

409
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:45,950
that best practices by health care for
healthcare yes when high-tech ur

410
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,830
purpose we are a little bit
