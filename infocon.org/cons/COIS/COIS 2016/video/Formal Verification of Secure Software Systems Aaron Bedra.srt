1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,990
the idea to start this problem assets
done this class is done any anywhere in

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,849
public so goal is to actually formally
prove that what you've done works or

3
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:18,420
works intended we're gonna go into that
space walking all the way into it but

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,320
that's kind of the goal of this this
concept stop is to teach you some ideas

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,590
around 40 modeling following methods as
applied to scary we're gonna go like

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,738
this D there is a lifetime of learning
that's involved in making this really

7
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:37,280
work and dozens and dozens of years of
effort to make even the simplest things

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,030
so we're going to discuss the service
but I want to show you kind of some

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,160
techniques you can take away that are
kind of steps away from Real Palo proof

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,309
that also kind of baseball modeling that
can help verify programs of residence

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,030
categories that matter here the lowest
level of all modeling of our method

12
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,190
specification just simply having
specification that still doesn't if not

13
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,070
executable not verifiable but it is
actually a formal specification for

14
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,639
modeling is is just thats what you think
about us and we'll talk about shortly

15
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,240
there's an algorithm that you can
specify as we leave the specification

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,158
for the heads up there that a base level
is just that specification it's just

17
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,490
math in the crypt of it when you think
about if you have a suspect or suspects

18
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,298
something that there are these can be
comes back as well there's some talk on

19
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,549
whether that's true or not but you can
use that method that the lowest level

20
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:41,150
and has developed once you start you
actually implements a suspect you have

21
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:47,860
things you can do during the nation's
base specification things as as simple

22
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,990
as a type system still count as
momentous compiler can formally been

23
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,679
formally prove that the tapes are so
much better than others and we'll get

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,240
into some of that as well

25
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,589
but that's kind of the next game and
then finally those verification will

26
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,119
begin to solve areas and there is an
actual real chromatics behinds what's

27
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,560
going on we're gonna talk about all of
these but probably in varying degrees of

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,200
detail I'm gonna go have your on the
specification and development side and

29
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,429
I'm gonna touch the verifications I but
I'm gonna give you some references on

30
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,060
things that really actually spence you
know dozens of man years during this

31
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:32,650
time around afterwards talk I'm gonna
sell a bunch of stuff and assuming no it

32
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,390
wasn't it wasn't true but I wanted you
guys something to walk away with and

33
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,700
then to kind of research in your letter
above the stuff you probably have never

34
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,450
seen before

35
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,268
hands maybe it might be familiar but
some of the toughest maybe not seen

36
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:46,780
before

37
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,780
totally okay don't worry about it

38
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,310
references hasn't things go really did
you like this one read more

39
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:00,630
how much wud there before before we
start we have talked about why you tons

40
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,310
of effort goes into this is not
something you have to have a reason to

41
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,820
do you don't have a reason to do this
don't do it it will take it will cost

42
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:13,060
you your job was like but wasn't that
much right now we're not gonna get us

43
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:21,060
there was one of my favorite ones which
ends and get the most out of it but this

44
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,780
is actually important right before we
justify doing this we're starting to get

45
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,000
a little ridiculous right if we're gonna
be testing something that doesn't really

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,120
matter then you know maybe a bunch more
medication isn't

47
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,760
wheelhouse but if we're going to protect
against you know nation states real

48
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,450
adversary attacking you really have to
be sure that actually matter how about a

49
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:47,078
project that did that and and that was
something that actually is what they're

50
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:52,940
talking about now becomes ever seen or
read about the second project from

51
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,030
director really really cool

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,620
absolutely watch the video I took some
drones

53
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,470
and they gave into the red team and they
of course destroyed them to control them

54
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,040
in various ways to come just a few
minutes and they reimplemented OS for

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,480
the drone and a fully verified runtime
and then they give a clergyman gave him

56
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,760
access and everything they couldn't
touch and then they moved us into the

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,030
Boeing unmanned aerial drones and have
since its right so when you talk about

58
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,448
that level of assurance and that level
of safety critical at this up actresses

59
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:32,690
by now most of us in the room I'll be
aren't gonna go that deep but this is an

60
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:42,680
awesome example of applied for a couple
of recent one is that crypto is really

61
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,430
small compact and precise right it
specified so you can see the work

62
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,080
inspecting make one up and wanna do
really rinky dink nonsense crypto so

63
00:04:53,080 --> 00:05:00,490
it'll be really really easy to kind of
be before we start some languages are

64
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,240
better at modeling so when it comes to
go there's kind of one language of

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,430
people usually go to what's most of the
people used

66
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:19,720
see ya see is for lots of reasons that
one of the best language did you do you

67
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,700
use it like it's also one of the worst
model because of all the stuff you do in

68
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,930
between memory management manipulation
in the things you do against 2010

69
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,349
comparison and other stuff to get it
right as a bunch of implantation details

70
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:37,479
actually don't matter at all to the
model of what the conditions look like

71
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:40,880
when it comes out the other side so you
can actually take you know you

72
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,479
implementation language and your modern
languages separate them what you end up

73
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:53,050
doing is creating a nice Easter read
patient-specific remodel and that in a

74
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,840
you know all the way down to the meat
potatoes invitation to figure out

75
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:06,590
whether or not they did you so we're
gonna see here is we can do go can use

76
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,729
both and we can actually based on his
mother's model

77
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:12,539
inflation and we'll go to that exercise

78
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:18,200
so I don't have one described her lovers
and you have to wonder sometimes but

79
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:27,860
this is not gonna do this do this
because it really is one of the simplest

80
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:34,930
things simple very easy model very
simple and the good news it looks like

81
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:44,050
that's the kind of thing this paper and
actually make sure it's correct have two

82
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:51,820
tests for it but I really wanna go
further hike I really have to type in so

83
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:57,010
i guess im all information on this model
is written in a language called has

84
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:05,909
anybody seen one so don't worry about it
I'll explain the basics everything that

85
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,590
has gone that everything but most cases
that was fighting which is the name of

86
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,849
the function what types of attacks in
the output type it returns and ask a

87
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,980
particular injury which is the shifts a
string of the message and returns the

88
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:22,780
fighters were given the important we got
crossed every character who make sure

89
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,039
that in the range of the upper case
alphabet which is our are constraints is

90
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,500
very important when you model something
to make sure your constraining it to the

91
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,080
real world

92
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,640
whenever you don't properly concerned
model application is very difficult in

93
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,370
this case when I say they say he is
ready to take the injured diana is

94
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:46,560
characters and do the March 26 which is
part of this kind of returning character

95
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,689
is part of the story

96
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:52,129
that's that's that's the model that
seems like that's the whole thing so

97
00:07:52,129 --> 00:08:06,789
that's cool it's you know now so we
didn't see our C code is buggy for

98
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:11,369
various reasons if you have a sec you'll
spot at you quickly you may not because

99
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:16,739
he doesn't some bugs in the presence of
some functions here will probably look

100
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:36,889
you immediately if you use that there's
one of the half-dozen bugs in here yet

101
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:39,889
but the big one

102
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:50,079
well i can tell you believe it leave it
to the surprise of a little bit right so

103
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:57,339
I have a model has to have a thing and
see how do I know I do it because

104
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:01,490
property-based debts which attracted
about their own kind of models in and of

105
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,899
themselves into property based testing
is likely to show you a couple of them

106
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:11,170
even see what can do is stated that you
know my Cesar function that are unhappy

107
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,870
with the same as the C function

108
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:19,040
the problem is that he thinks it's not
exactly what tests both code and safe

109
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,209
environment we actually use how schools
that calls shared objects and she can

110
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:28,439
read out to the compiled objects

111
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:38,710
we do rap R C code again asked you what
you doing here is importing the symbolic

112
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:50,060
go into a file type C 63 and returns a
string when you use interfaces so seat C

113
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,630
code code

114
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,030
stringency you're characterizing season
converting yet to do that

115
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,079
checking to make sure that the types are
irregular property donated it to

116
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,650
function as a rapper again when I talk
about tyson's being part of the formal

117
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,350
specification part of our modeling type
system can do that kind of work right

118
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:16,000
she's typing jobs types ok then they do
some do some some ok stuff when you get

119
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,210
into a type system that really is is
after a correctness a lot more than any

120
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,620
other fun stuff they're not relevant to
talk whatsoever including a kind of

121
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,890
wrapping the secret to making sure all
the munching an internal manipulation or

122
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,090
you just talked about in terms of your
house on the outside

123
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,560
up our environments and asking actually
called both the first one at the house

124
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,160
of code

125
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,459
ship it to you in a latex attack at dawn
and then it was called the C code and

126
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,450
shipped it to you in the same time we
can see that they're right on the basic

127
00:10:53,450 --> 00:11:01,830
tests by ramit see you in its
environment right that's cool now we

128
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,650
have some stuff to address so if you
wanna run this is a test we actually

129
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,910
have to go all the way through and make
sure it runs all the way through to us

130
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:15,069
so we're going to have to fix the types
who has to work I'm gonna skip this is

131
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,270
irrelevant right now

132
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,949
went to the property

133
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:24,510
property says that any of that I
generate the output of calling this one

134
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,870
of these to you about these functions
with the same shipment same string

135
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,540
should give me the same message telling
me that the cipher texts the same in

136
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,360
both cases which is about to tell me
that the same thing right

137
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,650
having a discrepancy run this I could
see no discrepancies that's my that's my

138
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:45,420
statement against a string is generated
constraints go down to just uppercase a

139
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:51,650
disease that makes it the impetus
satisfied just like that work with his

140
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:59,790
ass kicked by that that's more just some
transportation the generator so we got

141
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:06,349
some tests properties at a school in
2012 show you that is what happens if we

142
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:18,920
run that with our current budget so
right now I have is a failure when I

143
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,620
tested this string whatever you know
planes acts produced a different value

144
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:31,650
in both cases so what I would do is say
she's a function of the ship tattoo and

145
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:43,880
I grabbed that and I see this and then I
wanna do this again and something is

146
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,120
going on here may not be obvious

147
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:59,410
but there's definitely got it something
something in the memory it is a memory

148
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,040
now it's great to see like a file path
show up or something that's obviously

149
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,939
president but here was saying we're
seeing here is a memory issue exposing

150
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,600
our test without really digging into the
code or understanding it would expose

151
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:22,180
things like this is just got in there
but I get one that lets us do is run

152
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:29,650
back fix our code and keep going I can
go back to a model under the cheating

153
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,430
way which is actually fix all the bugs
fixes the general bounced check did that

154
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,930
fix the overriding the pilots

155
00:13:46,380 --> 00:14:00,860
environments and everything works right
so what I'm seeing is a rapid pace right

156
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,140
so if you're looking at this I can just
quickly to her writing code to make sure

157
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:10,699
that things are not pregnant but I'm not
running 1 test I'm running a whole bunch

158
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:16,270
of tests generated in this kind of
testing like it round about way

159
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:21,290
investing with purpose and concrete
statement of what should happen right

160
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:27,219
for all or you know the things you can
actually put into a mathematical

161
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:34,959
equation right because they run it

162
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,430
10,000 times one of the millions I'm
gonna billion times for two weeks when

163
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,270
it for a year right you can do this
however you want you to control the

164
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:46,370
knobs are you could turn it into your
status with the question then becomes

165
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:52,480
the rhizosphere a problem of how much is
enough for black-box testing 123 say

166
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,740
stop when we can actually work you know

167
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:02,210
we haven't formally proven a meeting all
we've done is built been able to verify

168
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:07,940
things to build confidence but actually
get us all the way to you satisfied

169
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:14,500
right is way better than a single unit s
but I'm not actually confident that it's

170
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,880
really really accurate also there was a
whole lot of work right there was a

171
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,920
whole bunch of work for really not much
award right we gonna bug and CD so in

172
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,199
some cases it's better than others
because in some cases of course the

173
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,270
tunnel code and you really can't see all
of us right it doesn't fit the SlideIT

174
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,270
huge thing actually get your long

175
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,620
recommends just kind of disregarding
really cool but in this case a lot of

176
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:51,070
work for little or so what better way
services are the mountainside and then

177
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,010
I'm going to inflation side and will be
back in the middle of the first in the

178
00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:05,680
language research for military other
applications and they could this

179
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,540
language that's a language specifically
created for specifying couple hours and

180
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:18,730
that's really really cool so I messed up
with examples and working you'll see

181
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,060
something that is similar to a school in
here because that's what is built with

182
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:26,609
but you start to create you know what I
had before proper underneath there when

183
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,270
you actually run the property you can
call something you should check with a

184
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,290
quick check through which actually has
an SMT solver

185
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:40,960
proving something works but I was asked
about the creation of tools see solvers

186
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,120
the SAT solvers their improvers all
those exist within the context of you

187
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,890
can run them on your code and actually
have been returned if you model right

188
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:53,430
around the literature but in this case
is very simple and see and we see what

189
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,280
we probably shouldn't you be up to
formally proven that these two functions

190
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:05,220
are now that was needed so we can step
further and model r/c decipher

191
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,408
so then what you do is you know the
exact same thing that we had before

192
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:17,370
going to smoke in a bit different
language but we can then you are simple

193
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,219
model before we open up the environment
policies are functionally the same

194
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,409
message of course we do the same answer
you have before you take it a step

195
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:31,159
further cause how to write you know we
can make better models because of the

196
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:37,610
SMT solver we can prove them so we can
write the reverse gravity Cesar Cesar

197
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:43,090
running back and forwards and actually
formally prove that I'm up to now start

198
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,939
with a working formally proven model
that we know is gonna be outside so then

199
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,850
we use data tests are a nation we have
something that we could you ever have a

200
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:57,010
test and one thing disagrees are both
degrees at least one of them is so you

201
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,730
can prove that least one that one of the
right no matter what you know if that's

202
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,320
the hard part of a test when it fails
you know which side of it so maybe had a

203
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,320
test that being a broken test not broken
immigration

204
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,620
raising your hand right now because you
have to write this is a common thing so

205
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,620
knowing that one side of this is always
right is really powerful

206
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:27,389
so they'll give us a better way to mom
and it gives way to prove that I'm so

207
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:31,769
that's one side of the equation but we
lost all be interrupted we just had the

208
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:35,570
environment before the script can
rightfully so

209
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:44,100
so there's a tool which is kinda which
includes army are reabsorbed

210
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:56,779
verification tool for see jobs and
capital with a couple of basic examples

211
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:01,340
of nothing to do with security crypto
we're gonna have to find some bucks so I

212
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,918
have a big win see I have a reference in
see that we know works was that good

213
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:15,019
numbers together and then I have added a
bug where if mexico 251 return that but

214
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:21,499
it's not compiling it outright compiled
by you know more modern C compilers have

215
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:25,389
lockers there's the machine code
compiled so you can also compiled code

216
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:34,439
which is far and execute on the back and
see lange in LVM week and then you saw a

217
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,169
scripting language analyze this and
extract the current findings from the

218
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:44,730
functions and then run them against
cruise or the arms right miss guess what

219
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,749
I'm saying is an equivalence there we
also induced radio Saturday

220
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:50,470
satisfiability

221
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,519
improving are two different ends of the
spectrum when you looking for a vacation

222
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,549
one or the other could be faster based
on how you specify the pier

223
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,249
different schools have different speeds
and which they can identify a problem so

224
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:07,950
what approaches that I can say i SAT
Circle se find me a value where this is

225
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,490
true

226
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:13,119
right well as well i'm saying is I have
a theorem given an external I've thats

227
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,499
the reference in the bug don't tell me
what you that's right you're getting to

228
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:21,110
a point away with the beer for the
failed proof I'm gonna say their

229
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,639
equivalents prove me wrong we're
standing at the problems like the

230
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:28,119
differently and that's all that a great
around there might find a different way

231
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:32,830
in this case it's pretty simple when you
have more complex models more complex

232
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,439
equations

233
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,009
how you say it matters a lot it's a
difference between your your crew for

234
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:41,200
turning in a couple of minutes or never
returning all or maybe you're presenting

235
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,210
an hour see you on my break how you
stated that she was analyzed and

236
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:52,740
optimized for the question we run this
will see right away that that the Site

237
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:59,649
Search and the field proof bowl show
with an extra five so again finding bugs

238
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:03,508
that actual specifying anything other
than I expect these things to to behave

239
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:14,429
so do the same thing in job are all use
excess of 75 we see what was wrong

240
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:20,929
same exact type used that exact but will
compile Java compiler his job by code

241
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:21,500
regardless

242
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,330
again will you saw tobacco extracts arms
and this time we'll say we have a

243
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:35,139
serious job a job opportunity but both
these cases we use a favor and we're at

244
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:38,428
it it'll show us our job right away

245
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:43,850
place to find a property and so what
we've done that is specified what should

246
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,919
happen not how you go about testing

247
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:52,630
this idea is really really important a
lot of us were testing the test right we

248
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:57,930
say hello if we do this this and this
and this result house and sometimes

249
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,790
that's great and sometimes it gets you
back to the point and sometimes it's

250
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,700
actually easier but nobody else can you
please so we end up in these situations

251
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,780
redefining a behavior that should happen
usually finds a man always your buddies

252
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:18,250
so what does give us now is a modern
language that works better and can be

253
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,490
formally proven and interrupt you can
use that actually pulls things in quick

254
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,910
I didn't write wrapper that in fact type
conversion in view all that stuff

255
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:33,580
originally I just pull it and go ahead
just great escape an entire now a little

256
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,639
unfair to have school because there are
some cool the automatic for you but

257
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:48,510
they're still kinda automatic access or
something that means of so possess great

258
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,560
entire code this is the part that
matters right this is encrypt and

259
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,070
decrypt right vs boxes in the key
expansion things that make our the

260
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,050
working on this light because they won't
fit on the slight but this is the the

261
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:08,139
meets this is where the real
specification of a bus comes it this has

262
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,780
been for my driven as part of the couple
also you can go in the examples and see

263
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:18,320
it is not my own writing but what's more
important here is that what we have here

264
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:25,780
is something we can do not fit the slide
all there's no there's no way to do that

265
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:33,040
so we pretend we have the impression I
have it today and then we do is we start

266
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,540
finding where in with Asian face I have
a different method in crypto

267
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:46,740
yes one of the easiest ones to look is
on the right

268
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:52,649
you have a key and you have a number of
times expand the key so when you have a

269
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,260
state machine like this is a general

270
00:23:54,260 --> 00:24:01,690
so we're talking about his network when
you have a hard way back in the day any

271
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,190
hardware stuff to logic synthesis

272
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:12,950
like developing developing circuitry to
test your connection so it's a little of

273
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,370
the gates interactions with you had a
finite state machine your hardware and

274
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,989
so basically you do is used as a tool to
make sure the circuitry design was

275
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,380
actually correct for you should be great

276
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:28,940
that same idea about this for hardware
especially when you have seen a place

277
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,310
where we can actually create a
representation of a network of a finite

278
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:40,399
state machine underneath the patient
because it is what we're doing is we can

279
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,840
use it

280
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,169
ABC's bill that he is the nanny
generates a sequence of bits that

281
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:55,060
defined the network with a yes we do
there are machines that are already

282
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:01,850
published for AAS take published version
of state machine monitors in the state

283
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,990
machine generate one for your code and
the public's you doing just networks are

284
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,990
disappointed knots at solving

285
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:19,150
sorry it's just simple mobile network
doesn't give a problem when you run it

286
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:24,810
happened about it said this input value
just didn't work like I tried it didn't

287
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:32,409
work then and there was a spot problems
in that one but he gave your card

288
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:43,200
information to us what happened but what
you saw was that this is tough you look

289
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,310
at the strings are gonna look encrypt
more or less

290
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:53,200
misusing his email but most of the time
you gonna see the garbage you're not

291
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,340
going to whether or not its rights or
correct locations here one is of course

292
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,840
if you could mess up data customers she
was somebody tampering with your tummy

293
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,320
delivered you and doesn't work

294
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,408
or maybe as as a backdoor providing some
detail in detail you wouldn't know it if

295
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:14,960
we actually use this kind of tool to
find out that actual temperature or

296
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,480
they've got an incorrect which happens
more than you want to so many couples

297
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,960
there in time I'm gonna skip over an
inverter graphs and lots of this because

298
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:36,230
it's really cool but so with XP sorry I
talked about inside out how do you take

299
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,539
an invitation and figure it out

300
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:43,750
mixture through the other part of
modeling and specification and a series

301
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:51,169
of interactions just outside be beaten
the thing to death for now talk about

302
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:57,809
something different but as a tool called
purple sheets analyze the tool by mitre

303
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,360
actually the protocol and examine
protocol for efficiencies and

304
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,399
insecurities so how does protocol
exchange work now of course you can

305
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:11,428
apply to go but like I said I'm not
going to go down that road this tool

306
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:16,850
found some bugs were actually quite old
shutter key exchange protocol that had a

307
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:21,620
nineteen year old bug nobody at Panorama
still got it it was real quick so

308
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,939
there's a really cool stuff that
happened as a result of the still being

309
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:32,519
developed but i wanna talk about now is
modeling the world's so I wanna see our

310
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,120
world Maker services where everything's
a service and we have a few thousand

311
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,199
services during fourteen thousand
different things

312
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,710
authentication gets more difficult
because many patients do a service and

313
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:47,120
everything else is getting its so we'll
pretend that you know we have a

314
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,809
centralized all service and we have a
couple of ACB services

315
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:54,210
hanging off the side so

316
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,510
I'm gonna go through this and instead of
going through the details about the idea

317
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,889
dialect here's a list by electron-beam
dialects that you describe things and we

318
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:11,520
end up having a protocol we describe
what's our our service we describe our

319
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:19,340
services are just so it's just a call
call and response kind of thing but

320
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,179
talks about you know what's gonna happen
right there going to be a username and

321
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:28,550
password it's looking back at signs in a
service still using the channel and

322
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:33,260
provide a token to get information and
user will cordell that's right they're

323
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,480
going to 179 passwords even so getting
sending data over to get the channel

324
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:44,520
getting it back and so on shelton's are
based at the execution execution model

325
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,350
look like right when I have his a bunch
of noise

326
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,159
and then I have channel

327
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:58,100
channel has a couple of important things
as the chance to have some kind of

328
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:04,730
long-term keep their private right thing
you see a sign right that's devastating

329
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:10,399
is quite important matters as much we
don't have it was the signing a

330
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,979
long-term he should be considered quite
know what we're doing is create a model

331
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,980
of the world where we hope that nobody
has information

332
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:25,250
interactions which is basically called a
user called TV service and so on recent

333
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:29,059
one of the most important part right

334
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:35,070
assume that there's a non-original
long-term key that's the sucky and me as

335
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,149
soon as we have an understanding private
theater using sign it took those two

336
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:40,729
pieces of information are very very
important very critical security of our

337
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:46,779
date and so if we run this was gonna do
is take the model of the world and find

338
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:51,200
all possible to bidding or actions that
take place and generate results now has

339
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,340
an image of one of them right is the
fully realized version of login call one

340
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,850
service possible options are login do
nothing

341
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:04,480
login call service a lot and they were
supposed to have been looking for those

342
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,980
are possible

343
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:11,770
that's the whole thing but the thing
that says we haven't done anything long

344
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,620
journey and yes that's right

345
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:21,189
once we do that we run the model if I
knew that long term he could probably do

346
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,790
all kinds of stuff in between us right
now telling us hey I can get the middle

347
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:29,168
of us I mean it's very obvious that
somebody has to be able to manually but

348
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:32,820
what is doing here showing you that
that's happened right as you model is it

349
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,409
shows you that my model is incorrect and
not have a line I have accountability

350
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:42,490
which is not a man so again I didn't
specify how I just said the world should

351
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:48,090
behave like this would happen if it did
right and so this was the first of all i

352
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:53,120
got really didn't specify that was an
unoriginal under he doesn't make sense

353
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,580
how could somebody have to say that
that's what I have to do specify model

354
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:04,270
that's something doesn't tell me what
happened to the right so this looks

355
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,970
obvious that certainly yes when you
think of modeling you have to think

356
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:18,980
about what the consequence so the last
couple of years in this space there's

357
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:25,809
been a ton of things quite a ways
forward but soon be really really rough

358
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:28,970
and that they are so kind of their
academic quality I would call him a

359
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:34,160
bright it means that their research base
they've sold that purpose

360
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,940
12 PCs worked on it solve the problem
elected president commercial right

361
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:44,540
commercialization of formal methods
tools as immature right in its infancy

362
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,889
but last couple years to improve format
so I told

363
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,600
source file free again

364
00:31:51,600 --> 00:32:00,760
quality in most cases but active pending
requests offered me so there's there's

365
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,710
hope

366
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:06,000
with the tools bring new ideas within
reach doing this on your own five ten

367
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,140
years ago would have been mostly people
that have to do it and you could have a

368
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,899
success

369
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:19,149
a big one right and then things like the
concert C compiler that using for

370
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:23,520
aviation have come round of polymeric
compilers and things like that actually

371
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,330
really helping people get the rich and
the thing to remember is that when you

372
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,949
doing this stuff you can only formally
verify so many things you can do all

373
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,750
right

374
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,750
compiler at the critical component
verify everything else going to go to

375
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:42,649
sign because going all the way down is
is just years and years and years of the

376
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:49,600
work for people who just use every day I
think it was ten years for dr. Atkins do

377
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,100
the colonel and it was just a car but
the crowd control the execution path

378
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:04,219
which got rid of all the really nasty
takeovers I promise references projects

379
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:11,179
projects helping their fire has some
interesting stuff which is the bytecode

380
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:15,929
extractor Java and C you but it's it's
really proud of how you extract samples

381
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:21,230
from bite code and use them in in other
contexts which is how you have that that

382
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:25,539
places a soft compared to just so it's
really interesting thing to look at how

383
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:31,250
the technique for you for joining us and
kind of playing with it in space and

384
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:36,409
then CPSIA its there's really no Forum
website for the bunch of papers from

385
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:38,300
either quality

386
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:44,970
but that some of the paper for CBS and
so I think I've gotten to offer 25

387
00:33:44,970 --> 00:34:19,400
minutes in just under question that
anybody wants that CBS a source code

388
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,760
examples and you'll see a bunch of stuff
there

389
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,490
foundational studies you home in there
the handshake protocols that are in

390
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:31,709
inside of there that are also model yet
there is some messed up is sitting there

391
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:49,500
as examples for sure and it's it's just
a pop up in a few different of a tool

392
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:59,290
that I talked about you know and so now
we have been weakened right because by

393
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:04,950
the time so you doing research this is a
great place to start doing research for

394
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:09,299
something to play with your spare time
but yeah I mean these tools are

395
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,610
available now and then work can be done
and there's a little to get up speed but

396
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,860
really it's once you get there it's
