1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
on illegals perspective on data security
for 2016 for those of you that might

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,349
have come from the previous session we
we've got some extra law for you got

3
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:13,929
some new things to share and what more
could you ask for back-to-back visions

4
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:17,190
on a must if you don't realize is
actually a legal summit with some

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,539
additional conferences on cybersecurity
so we'd like to thank you for coming

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,019
back and my name is Gino chip or us and
I'm one of the principals of the firm

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,220
Cerberus and associates and I'm
presenting today with Mehmet mourners a

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,460
partner at my firm little background
about myself on the Columbus native and

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,790
i've lived here most of my wife wants
Capital University Law School spent some

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,570
time at Bank One corporation which is
now JPMorgan Chase working with Jamie

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,309
Dimon steam on information security many
years ago and started a firm and cyber

12
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:51,300
security and information security as
well as electronic financial services

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,959
now about 12 years ago and I've been
working with you know for the last two

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,230
years or so in the background and
technologies while and I also work with

15
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:05,459
a couple years at IBM before coming back
to work with the No again as outside

16
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,639
legal and of course the reason we've
been doing this for the last six years

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,049
is a strength of our Dilbert cartoons
because of that Dilbert cartoons all

18
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,040
he'd have to talk about his loss I'm
hoping we were able to arise the

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,240
presentation did in sync with my last
match in the highest in everything else

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:32,939
it's not just the lights on so you
actually can see us because I feel like

21
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,520
we're somewhat in the witness protection
program with their faces multiple so far

22
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,729
so today we're gonna be looking back at
20:15 for about six years I wanna say

23
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,340
thanks in part to take a step back and
talk about PCR simply because we're in

24
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,130
the beginning of the year and then goes
by and get a look back and look ahead so

25
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,250
that's gonna do you gonna talk about the
federal regulators how they become more

26
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,360
capable and technical by the time you're
done with this you will see that the the

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,740
federal regulators and state regulators
are looking at these issues technical

28
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,740
level 'cause day technology

29
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,760
and then we're going to be talking about
expanding federal regulation and

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,920
regulators will look at states

31
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,559
guidelines briefly so the question to be
jet about the security from a legal

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,750
perspective is regulated says actually
said something about this so I think

33
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,940
it's worthwhile discussing and then
we'll talk about how to prepare based on

34
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,240
some of this information we talk about
then international privacy should some

35
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,680
of these issues have been discussed in
the previous presentation so we may not

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:49,360
get into it into much detail if let's go
back to 2015

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,680
bridges in 2015 was yet to reach
millions of people got social security

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,600
numbers of personnel management will
also be the commonality between these

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,630
two on assay was the action of state
actors or for that matter both of these

40
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:13,549
approaches were so I'll talk to China
from my understanding and any of the

41
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,970
other which is that came up with that is
one of the reasons I like this was

42
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,170
because I think about you know I bit
sensitive data

43
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,709
Europeans have different understanding
of sensitive data it relates to sexual

44
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,019
preferences etc that we don't really
think about and we think about the sense

45
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,660
that I think about sensitive personal
data in the United States credit card

46
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,790
associate number but Ashley Madison what
end up happening is the data ended up

47
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,299
losing was mainly usernames email
addresses and other performances

48
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,300
included but it affected individuals

49
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:02,950
that the other issue that year after
year the Wyndham which dates back to

50
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,660
2012 so that's what happened that's when
if he started going after wind but

51
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:15,120
unlike most companies debt when they
have a breach of security

52
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:21,700
decided not to settle and they decide
the FTC issued an injunction at that

53
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,479
point they try to be an injunction and
the case was all the way up to the

54
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:34,320
appeals court and we were thinking that
if the chances were slim that when there

55
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,659
was in fact going to win and be able to
argue that the FTC hadn't followed

56
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,389
through on its duties to somehow come up
with regulation or more concrete

57
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:50,040
guidelines about what it has to tell
company that he can do that was windows

58
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,510
are you don't happen and so you have to
go back issue regulations that's what

59
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,919
ever seen regulator does and then you
can come out to meet for having violated

60
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:07,469
where the FTC mean the relies on its IPO
relating to deception on fair trade and

61
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,500
I think that's one of the biggest
distinctions between our presentation

62
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,229
the presentation before us with a focus
predominantly on statutes that govern

63
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:18,740
data protection and data security but we
want to spend some time doing today is

64
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,490
going through individual settlements of
enforcement actions and litigation so

65
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,650
you can see what's actually happening in
the trenches and people are being forced

66
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,650
to accept that isn't necessarily in the
statute itself

67
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,430
one other thing that you may see among
reaching 2015 you likely continue to see

68
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:40,120
large rich don't forward the effect it
has on the see this video target

69
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:47,280
resigned CIL design director of opium
resign the CIA 00 p.m. resigned and

70
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,859
asked about it since he resigned mainly
because the bridges that subject last

71
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,039
year so I think we'll continue to see so
effective that having said that let's

72
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:04,740
move on to other normally when I'm doing
presentations are minutes doing

73
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,840
presentations we look at the lead
federal regulators and data protection

74
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,849
which are prey

75
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:14,649
merrily the office civil rights for help
and banking regulators are very common

76
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:21,699
sources of enforcement agencies that is
very broad amorphous enforcement

77
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:26,069
statutes to get very specific results
based on failure to follow reasonable

78
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:31,959
security procedures either in a define
security rule or or a particular

79
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,339
regulation that turns to a standard like
a new standard or something like that

80
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:40,429
well now there's no there's new new
parties at the table that are expanding

81
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:45,638
their privacy enforcement as well such
as the FCC recently entered into a

82
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,229
multi-million dollar settlement arising
from marketing without consumer consent

83
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:53,389
and the Securities and Exchange
Commission brought it brought an action

84
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:58,939
against artists which is a brokerage the
broker-dealer and it's very interesting

85
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:03,889
because the the SEC enforcement action
focused on the fact that during an audit

86
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:10,649
that RT Jones which is the the legal
name that company maintained client PRI

87
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:14,809
on its third party hosted web server but
did not adopt written policies and

88
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:19,119
procedures reasonably designed to
safeguard its clients information as

89
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:22,829
required by as required by the
safeguards were all so for example the

90
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:26,259
policies and procedures for this broker
dealer did not include conducting

91
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,990
periodic risk tax risk assessments did
not include employing a firewall to

92
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,769
protect web servers did not include
encrypting client information stored on

93
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:39,050
that server or establishing procedures
in advance corresponding cyber security

94
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,939
incidents and I think it's interesting
here because it entered into a $75,000

95
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:47,869
civil money penalty and I wasn't an
actual abrasion there was an allegation

96
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:48,889
of harm

97
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:53,360
failure to have proper procedures in
place so each of these regulators for

98
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,919
organizations in their specific
regulatory jurisdiction are now looking

99
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,919
at both privacy and data security on a
regular basis

100
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,609
mentioned that this one of the things
that the FTC we're not gonna talk about

101
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:21,010
it too much detail but before the FTC
goes about having some sort of area or

102
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,440
two before it goes to congress saame new
legislative power to some sort of study

103
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,520
they did that with data did that with
data aggregators and the knowledge is

104
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,390
announced that they're doing what I
simply because no single data breach

105
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,229
them to credit cards come up every
single one of those entities that time

106
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:46,390
that we just happened so we'll probably
see more about that just for the fun

107
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:53,740
that's the legal standard 44 regulate
rule 38 SP which is the broker-dealer

108
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,130
privacy role it's a willful violation if
the person charged with the duty knows

109
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,740
what he's doing it's not a requirement
that person be aware he's actually

110
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,370
violating the law so because their
specific data protection requirements

111
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,330
for broker-dealers just the fact that
you're working in that area

112
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:21,910
unaware of your arms doesn't protect you
back to saying yes

113
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,280
because we're going to talk about the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

114
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,920
doing basically the same thing with the
Walla Walla cases of payments processor

115
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,459
and they're they're fined $100,000 and I
think these are meaningful things where

116
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,310
they're actually would see the thing is
these are these are regulatory actions

117
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,349
that arise out of audits where they find
during the audit that there is

118
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,280
insufficient data protection and they
they have a breach of their legal duty

119
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,089
to protect data before there's an
incident so it's an awareness that

120
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,820
there's a problem prior to an incident
as opposed to something larger

121
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,470
settlements like the Wyndham cases are
situations where there's large data

122
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,460
breaches that result in massive data
theft credit card usage and things like

123
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:24,210
that these are pre harm harm enforcement
actions and choices are those limited so

124
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:45,240
that the regulator 10 buku some of that
action is CIA

125
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,449
an agreement that they have to actually
as part of the settlement have to agree

126
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:56,378
to ongoing maintenance and ongoing
third-party audits and instruction and

127
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:01,379
training and third-party penetration
testing engine if the consent decree

128
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:08,579
regulating my end up calling the FTC
case in an important action this is your

129
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,839
average enforcement action what you end
up seeing is the entity that is subject

130
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,189
to FTC enforcement action has to
designate somebody that is it

131
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:20,209
responsible for privacy security chief
security officer Chief Privacy Officer

132
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:26,149
usually and then have to conduct weeks
depending on your industry or you may

133
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:31,049
already have an obligation to monitor
the risks identified in implementing the

134
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:36,079
features and one of the toughest things
about the new PC connection is back at

135
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:43,748
it last 11 years and so far since about
2002 more than 50 companies that it's

136
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:51,610
the who's who of Microsoft's Facebook
Google Plus but my first time Google had

137
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,799
an enforcement action didn't get a
second time around he was violating

138
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:02,699
supported cookies Safari browser 5125
you think about $25,000 fine for

139
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:07,809
violations teams rather but that was the
second time around

140
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:13,910
date at the Apple those already and they
ended up so that should have been a

141
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,618
bigger call to action but we think about
being second largest company by company

142
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:23,389
out there were hundreds of billions of
dollars opposition $25,000,000

143
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,420
and tracking cookies are major revenue
generator for them so that his and how

144
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,329
they make revenue by tracking people
going back to your going back to your

145
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:36,479
question briefly in addition to money
they always include remedial efforts so

146
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,259
when the RT jones' case had to employ a
point Information Security Manager they

147
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,139
had to adopt written security policies
they no longer store information on its

148
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:47,350
Web server and NEPA stored in the
network must be encrypted

149
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,300
from a stab new car while walking
firewalls and logging systems

150
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,859
specifically designed to protect to
detect malicious incursion which as we

151
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,050
know in target India garden overwritten
but at least you have to start with and

152
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,719
without let's talk a little more detail
about what has happened recently from an

153
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,490
SEC enforcement action relates to the
Asus Eee actresses about me it's a

154
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:22,150
system like Pegasus that's about work
well in the world you may have seen

155
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:29,220
their PCs but this doesn't relate to the
PC and asustado publicizing their

156
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,940
routers using phrases such as you're
secure space private select the file

157
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,580
sharing these are the new features of
the router that they were trying to push

158
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,700
and then increased privacy in the most
secure about proper question is that

159
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,200
stop right there why would you say any
of this with any product or something

160
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,730
that he really doesn't matter because
the chances are it's not true and if

161
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,060
it's not true then you're in trouble
because the FTC looking over your

162
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,849
shoulder

163
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,630
well the argument against saying these
things increases when you have

164
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:07,290
identification bypass vulnerability your
router's password disclosure process

165
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:14,870
requests for when you create an FTP
server features of this and you enable

166
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:20,040
its everybody on the internet can access
we'll talk about privacy by designing

167
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,349
security by design

168
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:30,830
this is the FTC stepping in saying this
is not the way and one of the worst

169
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,270
things about this is that it took months
to remedy

170
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:39,100
firmware in the email it out to
everybody and in the meantime individual

171
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,610
there was nothing they can do aside from
unplugging it because you can't have

172
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,770
your password

173
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:53,610
vulnerabilities there's not going to be
able to secure so as a result of that

174
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:58,210
the FTC specifically when in when we
talk about risk assessment and laid out

175
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,810
these conditions cases when you are
doing a risk assessment in the future

176
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,189
you are going to make sure that you do

177
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,290
this is the FTC coming out and saying
this is probably a third time the FTC

178
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:15,110
has done that's I'll keep perspective
but they're still calling out security

179
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,510
by design

180
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:23,580
I'm kinda like our guys talk waltz time
in your car

181
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:29,170
the transition must be on man you with
your foot on the clutch otherwise the

182
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,890
car will not start the car when the Sun
Drop what they've done based in effect

183
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:41,939
starting car driver so if he wants to
make sure that all of these areas of her

184
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,840
dress they do penetration testing and
the FTC moves from not just regulating

185
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,950
the information that the company
regulates to the device and words like

186
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,880
Cloud companies only more things
Internet of Things I guess is becoming

187
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,990
more and more you'll see this
enforcement action mission with Internet

188
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:09,850
of Things watch this so you see the FTC
becoming more and more technical in this

189
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,830
area because they employ technology to
go and research these areas and that as

190
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,870
a result into becoming significant for
us because if you in the business

191
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,330
serving consumers and if you're
developing new applications need to be

192
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:29,910
aware don't run into trouble in the FTC
will make sure action that you become

193
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:34,800
subject to the next to his wall up
talking about startups with minutes

194
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:42,130
thats family web and so you're sending
dollars over the web even around about

195
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,730
2009 they may have you heard about them
in talking about the coin that one of

196
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:55,310
the really doctors but then I think I
know because I also got involved some of

197
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,369
the money that they were holding belong
to mount gasoline that money into being

198
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,320
helped by them

199
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,430
the reason they got into trouble with
the CFPB are very similar to why cases

200
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:13,900
in a meeting with the FTC they made such
as exceed industry I don't need to go

201
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,850
much further but let's stop what is what

202
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:27,119
free startup what is next and how do you
see it let's assume you did saying that

203
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,360
given that was going to come out to you

204
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:45,750
reasonable with respect I want you to
notice as we look at different planes

205
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:55,490
horseman actions by different regulators
diseases such as representations not

206
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,700
right and the other thing is let's shoot
you understand what the industry centred

207
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,450
as you don't have to go get five
technical experts to talk about what

208
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,130
that is

209
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,840
you decide what that is on a given day
what happens to two months saying that

210
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,428
we talked about with PCI compliant with
PCI wonder what happens when did so

211
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,020
continues to make similar statement
online about its

212
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:28,220
the trouble is that not at the state and
see if he comes after and claims that

213
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,260
they make these claims falsely that they
did not in fact employees until

214
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,850
appropriate measures and that these were
misrepresentations I think it's

215
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,510
worthwhile talking about a briefly in
more detail what it is that the people

216
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:48,400
to do so they were founded in 2009 be
maybe statement from 22 2010 to 2014 and

217
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,000
then they did not have their meant to
first mandatory employee training until

218
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,210
2012 that's a five-year-old company the
first time doing risk assessment first

219
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,890
time they're doing and I would like to
argue that you need to be doing that

220
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,659
from day one

221
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:05,710
given to start being a start-up costs
but if you're a start-up in the

222
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,120
financial services community we're using
a bank or banks agent then your

223
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,658
obligations are all they need to ensure
that your information security is better

224
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:19,330
and they didn't they did some
penetration testing where they sent out

225
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:24,129
so fishing in 62% of the employees

226
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:30,370
25 percent of employees that click tried
to create an account in the bank

227
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:37,629
website that they did not think about
that what's the point of doing a risk

228
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,340
assessments

229
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:44,860
uncovered the kind of fact that they've
uncovered and do nothing about it and I

230
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,070
think what I end up seeing in the fact
that and related to wall is that of a

231
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,730
company that's trying is trying to do
things but it's a little too late and

232
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:58,960
not trying harder and the other issue
that they run into is that the six games

233
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,620
and have the wall Labs com we're only
applications it sort of the EPI residing

234
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,820
lady platform that they're creating
results in there they have their

235
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,620
information security policies procedures

236
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:18,770
profit but they apply to do all of that
calm but not to all adds up and the CFPB

237
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:24,320
points out it's saying well you have
information that needs to be on both

238
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,389
sides and completely ignored

239
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,650
think about it in terms of silos like to
be able to do that to a certain extent

240
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,230
when you're dealing with PCI DSS hey
Justin this is nowhere else and to the

241
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,679
extent that factually true but limited
there but but in the sense that they had

242
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:43,510
just randomly divided up the company and
decided to fly some policies in one

243
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:51,210
place or another that was wrong and he
was not entirely happy with that in

244
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,760
addition they transmitted sensitive
personal data without encryption the

245
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:00,390
email back or you can imagine them being
up payments company they had also to

246
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:07,630
financial information so the enforcement
action was very similar to what you see

247
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,940
with the FTC and the reason is because
he's been around for short periods and

248
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,140
some of its authority is very similar to
the FTC deceptive unfair practice

249
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,750
practice

250
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:25,830
deceptive and unfair trade practices are
between the FTC the CFPB also has a huge

251
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,000
trade practices this brand new that
they're probably going to extend a

252
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,800
little bit more on that some years but
you end up seeing is that they have to

253
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:39,760
stop the train employees that's not much
but then again four thousand miles

254
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,020
outside of that possible five million
dollars of aid which is nothing

255
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:51,030
compared to the six 365 million other
people so the other issue that I wanna

256
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,670
talk about with a respected wall and
probably one of the most important one

257
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:59,060
is that there was not a single data
breach that we know nobody's information

258
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:07,080
on thousands of bank so this is the CFPB
stepping forward and saying this is

259
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:14,350
their first cyber security privacy and
saying well unlike the FTC if you have a

260
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,730
violation of law which we believe this
is we will come after you even if there

261
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:28,600
is any will also pass the FTC first time
around 11 and 20 different but this is

262
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,310
too

263
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,310
enforcement agencies taking two
approaches

264
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,930
those of us who are government that's
where you end up seeing a lot bigger

265
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:45,440
this feisty institute is a rather large
healthcare group and they have 21

266
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:54,130
hospitals and 450 patients so that's
pretty large healthcare system and what

267
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,780
they ended up doing is out of reach and
being a filing with the OCR we have more

268
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,570
than 500 individuals will be impacted by
a deep under have a high-tech you have

269
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:12,870
to have an obligation with the HHS
health services and the HHS decided to

270
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:18,149
do once they found out that they had
lost the lap and black top 15

271
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:24,590
information for 13,000 patients included
everything from birth dates to address

272
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,709
these social security numbers diagnoses
laboratory results medications can

273
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:38,450
imagine living come and they ended up
finding out that financing security

274
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,700
management wasn't was limited to what we
saw that was incomplete

275
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,770
insufficient they fail to implement
appropriate safeguards and they lacked

276
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,930
policies and procedures to governor was
and removal

277
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,200
think what we're trying what we're
seeing based on language

278
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,370
problem wasn't supposed to have that
laptop for that laptop also have that

279
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,360
big inning but if they had that maybe
these should be encrypted right so that

280
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,189
this breach wouldn't have the facts of
the second case or similar smaller and

281
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:22,929
the North Memorial Hospital 20 minutes
and they have a breach similar to the

282
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:28,860
HHS decides to do an audit after upbeat
and what they find out is that the

283
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:36,090
business associate they have been in
point is the end they never had a bit so

284
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:44,780
that's a no obligation that you have to
have that talk about a purpose and he

285
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,309
didn't have here they gave the
information to the lost its their loss

286
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:54,899
there was only ten thousand people as it
turns out this business so she'd had

287
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:02,570
access to the information relating to
209 so this wasn't just got to tell you

288
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,289
get access to 300,000

289
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:16,720
you have to make sure they are a
business associate with Dad and I i

290
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:26,289
believe Israel fairly new so these are
the breaches having fun so there is a

291
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:33,299
lead the reporter breach than just gets
think sometimes we investigate all that

292
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:39,299
but I think one of the things that we
really struggle within our practices

293
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:43,090
fact they think some people have a
degree in science but there's so much

294
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,370
that needs to be done

295
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,418
everybody has limited budgets and
smaller you are as an organization they

296
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,950
are struggling you have by marketing
dollars to convert marketing dollars

297
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:59,010
into compliance stars and so as the cost
of compliance is what's your return on

298
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,929
investment for those compliance dogs
were the challenges that we're seeing

299
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:06,320
here is that compliance risk isn't some
future event now

300
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,559
dealing with our state and federal
regulators that are deeming you out of

301
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:16,279
compliance and penalties for anything
bad happen simply by virtue of an audit

302
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:21,190
or a minor breach identifying a bigger
problem and so a lot of these things

303
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,490
when you look at the underlying fact
patterns and he just left paper we have

304
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:28,250
a copy of each of these settlements are
you can identify what the alleged

305
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,809
failure was and what the remedy is these
are things that you look at them and I

306
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:35,269
think if you're in the business and say
something should have been done about

307
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:38,899
that so it's easy to look at these
settlements and say well that's obvious

308
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:41,949
that they had penetration test your
didn't they weren't doing it regularly

309
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,049
and they work implementing the changes
that need to be made well what happens

310
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:50,070
is that people probably had about 500
things to do and that wasn't the only

311
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,830
thing that they were dealing the point
is you really can't blink concert at

312
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:59,529
least make it a point to cover your
basics make it a point to realize that

313
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:04,159
you don't need to wait until you have
reached an enforcement action penalties

314
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,990
that by simply failing to have adequate
information security and adequate

315
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,360
training given the size and complexity
of institution is a violation of law in

316
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,908
the united we see the regulators want to
get in renting up wrapping up where you

317
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:27,679
may have gotten away with five years now
I don't now its violation of law here is

318
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,320
another example

319
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:37,000
next to highlight California Attorney
General Kamala Harris has been active in

320
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,980
the prosecutor Area California was a
first date fast which there and she has

321
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,559
been around since that time but one of
the things she did was to put together a

322
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,149
breach of any of these I'm sure you've
seen with some security vendors are out

323
00:27:55,149 --> 00:28:03,059
there that's very important well this is
what regulators because when you have an

324
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:09,899
obligation regular that's the case with
HHS that's also the case with

325
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:13,779
Californian most of the other state
attorney general's would like to know

326
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:19,850
when your data so that the action if
they feel like

327
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:24,928
but one of the interesting things that
they ended up doing in this case the

328
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:30,520
provocation on the california law to
implement reasonable what is so they

329
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,650
turned to what used to be known as the
sands 20 and now it's gone to center for

330
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,720
Internet Security is critical security
and they said you have to implement and

331
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:48,860
if you don't then you will be lacking
security and I'm not sure why they ended

332
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:58,250
up the consensus see what I want to say
that haven't looked at the list of

333
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,909
things that you have to do in the sense
that they are similar to what you would

334
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:10,130
have under a process be secure and they
also one of the other recognition now

335
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,789
these are not much state attorney
general and coming out and saying you

336
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:22,320
have to recommend but I think they also
slightly saying that you have to end and

337
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,320
I find out what you doing this egregious

338
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:32,880
between a lot of things are doing here
and I think that's becoming more and

339
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:41,419
more important as fast as yours and you
can make your password as long as you

340
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:59,710
want and its security but somebody has
to be something that will see that as a

341
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:05,159
condition that Jones said was acquitted
you encrypt not just portable devices

342
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,210
but also because what they saw was that
they were seeing a lot of that stuff

343
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:16,780
being stolen from health care and if
that's not security and they have been

344
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,210
pushing in that area there they're
saying in their numbers

345
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,539
number of encrypted devices and
healthcare sector is increasing like

346
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:25,620
they'd like to see

347
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,309
so what do you do to prepare because
when you have limited resources and you

348
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:34,720
have a ton of initiatives that your
company is trying to undertake how do

349
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,240
you realize what are the most important
things to do so you can prepare for

350
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,940
something like this and I think each of
these settlements is very instructive

351
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,850
because as you look at the settlements
the points EC and look fairly common

352
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:51,260
billet some way this dish it look like
the ISO standard they look like

353
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,100
checklist that you would want to have an
information security system but what's

354
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:55,909
the hook

355
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:00,020
they want you to actually do it so some
things to consider in this next is to

356
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:04,070
begin by preparing by doing intrusion
testing find out where your weak points

357
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,740
are used third parties to determine
whether or not their vulnerabilities

358
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,460
that you have you're not aware of and
that's probably how many vendors out

359
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,380
there that offer services like that but
before an incident happens created data

360
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:20,190
incident response plan we worked with
companies to create that plan in advance

361
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:24,929
and it's important to a customer
communications and developed an advanced

362
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:29,250
as well as people who you identify on
the team to determine whether breaches

363
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,679
occurred what the corporate message
would be you need to anticipate

364
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,350
regulator notifications that would be
required and such as federal regulators

365
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:42,169
now states all over the country are
having particular notification

366
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,970
requirements whether it's by email

367
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,630
of a breach whether you notify the
regulator whether you have to do a

368
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,600
publication identifying media so it's
not just enough to send something out to

369
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,530
the customer they are things that
triggers are different depending on the

370
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:59,600
kinds of information that or preached in
the state where the customer lives in

371
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,730
some states may be a duty in other
states there may not be so media is

372
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,170
always a consideration you need to know
the PR people are would be in advance

373
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:12,230
tickets in advance what happens now
here's where your lawyers get involved

374
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:18,140
by drafting internal privacy policies
which are internally facing policies for

375
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:23,000
how people handle information how they
share how they store it how they delete

376
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,900
it how they destroy it and most
importantly bender controls right and

377
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,100
then external privacy notices that tell
your customers or your employees are

378
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,750
your business partners for them on
notice how their information is going to

379
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,110
be use they need to match notices are
two different

380
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,250
and they're not the same one is a
procedure for employees

381
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,780
the other is a notice to the people
whose data is being collected and then

382
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,030
how do you keep it say you have to
develop reasonable information security

383
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:55,070
policies now here we are in 2016 and
we've just done a presentation involving

384
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,220
companies are really didn't have any to
speak up at work maybe siloed where they

385
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,740
had it for the parent company then they
have subsidiaries or divisions that

386
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,030
weren't even in the loop that would have
software developers that we're not even

387
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:12,700
trained in information security and the
other thing to consider you integrate

388
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,850
these with your H our policies and I
just have to do privacy training you can

389
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:20,799
include that component with other
employee training how to integrate with

390
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,220
our policies and identify the data
security teen you have physical security

391
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,530
issues

392
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:32,460
access hardware badges revocation
credentials things like that and then

393
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,910
here is where I spent probably sixty
percent of my time some some rights is

394
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:41,280
vendor management so you have all your
procedures in place are you imposing

395
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,260
those on your vendors said the same
standards as you expected your own team

396
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:51,049
are being imposed on the third party
that really becomes a problem when your

397
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:55,210
organization is mature but you hire
somebody to provide services because

398
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:59,140
they're really cool really fast and they
have something shiny and you had them

399
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,620
and a team of six people that are
venture funded that has 0 assets

400
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,659
whatsoever and they have insurance that
really doesn't cover you because you're

401
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,090
a third party and only covers them but
they're getting a lot of credit card

402
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,330
data or health care or they're doing
something whether its predictive

403
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,719
analytics whether its data analytics
with his portfolio management but you

404
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:21,500
need to make sure that those companies
are providing the same level of

405
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,050
information security and protection and
that is a chase down a rabbit hole isn't

406
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,190
in precise science and I'd like to say
that we had a wonderful experience and

407
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,879
everybody's doing it right that might be
somebody else presentation but in ours

408
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,290
we find is that it's an eternal journey
I feel like I feel like we're you know

409
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:40,668
we're trudging through New Zealand in
The Lord of the Rings trilogy working

410
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:42,279
our way to that destination

411
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,090
permission security at the end of the
day information security is a process

412
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:50,350
not a destination right so my point is
simply this is that don't just build

413
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:53,918
your own thoughts and then leave it
unattended or for the vendors to get the

414
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,220
information you need to make sure that
they have same standards and if you

415
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,430
can't actually make them financially
liable to at least need to have the

416
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:06,609
controls in place of the auditing them
but you you that you review their

417
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,720
facilities and that you do that you have
the controls and you don't have the

418
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,060
ability to yourself at least put the
controls in place and that's an obvious

419
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,370
settlements indicate that promises of
security that promises of privacy

420
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:24,190
failure of controls with that I think
we'll move on to the international price

421
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,500
section I know some of this was hoping
in the early our legal position so I

422
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,460
could have spent too much time on it but
those are you were wondering what is our

423
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,860
thing I really care no you don't he
didn't care about it before you if no

424
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:39,480
reason I don't think I should care about
it now because something you didn't care

425
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,930
about got rules was invalid and now
something else and you will still not

426
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:51,730
going to care about it because you don't
have any right but it was negotiated

427
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,420
between the commerce and the European
Commission for the transfer personal

428
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,620
data from the European Union to the
United because europeans are like us

429
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:02,410
look at crime scenes hey that's a
fundamental right and be treated

430
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,220
differently than we do

431
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:13,209
indestructible and important under the
FTC say the safe harbor safe harbor was

432
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,210
done by the FTC because

433
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:26,580
and then came up with a class action
lawsuit against Facebook and said I

434
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,400
didn't to United States and do you know
have you seen whatever stone at said

435
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:37,330
they they have access to everything and
and the stunning revelations that trans

436
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:42,900
brought against the Irish Data
Protection Commissioner relating to the

437
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:49,339
Facebook and the European Court of
Justice looked at that and ruled him out

438
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:54,960
procedure and so for the past six seven
months or so the regulators have been

439
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,210
trying to come up with a new way that
will help us balance transfers are you

440
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:11,650
up to tonight and that is now called the
EU privacy I don't know what was

441
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,910
shielding cool what from but doesn't I
don't think it's an appropriate means

442
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:19,739
get the part that I think concerns all
of us as the other issue that would

443
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:26,609
probably talked about in the BBC and its
relating to governments access to our

444
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:31,380
date how do they appeal would like to
limit that to the extent that they can

445
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,170
especially when it will lead to data was
collected in European Union and then

446
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:44,339
transfer the united states and the yard
several cases the Apple encryption case

447
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:49,078
that were hoping would talk so much more
chill about but because someone said hey

448
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:59,309
here's a YouTube and and the other cases
you may or may not be familiar with the

449
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:07,229
Department justices want to access data
relating to an individual who resides in

450
00:38:07,229 --> 00:38:13,308
Ireland and the email was residing can
and should the FBI have access to that

451
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:18,319
without going through the proper
channels sometimes you should I when

452
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:21,079
you're accessing data outside of your
jurisdiction

453
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:25,609
those kind of issues that we're
government access to personal data

454
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:28,609
perspective that we were dealing with
end up affecting

455
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:35,969
employees that have customers a pro when
they choose to bring that data to be

456
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:43,099
having are affecting the process so I
think was going to end up happening is

457
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:46,950
here by the time june july rolls around
we're going to have some sort of final

458
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:52,129
that's going to tell us how we can go
about transferring data from the

459
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:57,789
European Union not quite an improvement
that they've done over previously now

460
00:38:57,789 --> 00:38:59,569
there is a

461
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:07,609
Department of State's independent from
the investigative intelligence justice

462
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:13,799
where individual I don't know what might
be going are you collecting the school

463
00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:23,630
for national security purposes they can
go to the apartments a result he said

464
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:28,719
that you think about this and you think
how does that affect me how does you did

465
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:36,130
protection plans for that you have
employees in the EU and you want to have

466
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:40,859
their data here do you have shared email
directories phone systems do you have

467
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:45,380
backup and disaster recovery business
continuity where you eat you

468
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,349
businesses back up their data here
domestically and information passing

469
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:54,739
back here or supplier information for
customer information anything you want

470
00:39:54,739 --> 00:40:04,150
to move would be subject to violate the
law and they can bring your business

471
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:09,680
there and the ship the safe harbor
wasn't the only method of transferring

472
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,808
data to United States in the privacy
shield

473
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:18,410
there are other methods the other
advantages and disadvantages final rules

474
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:22,839
can be expensive than a contractual
clauses tend to work with everybody's

475
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:28,489
got a sign you need every company to
show to the local regulatory discussions

476
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:32,640
in fact authorized to sign that document
that that's the other side of having

477
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,489
prices on the right to build up iraq was
a lot more than you may see what we

478
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:43,619
describe a church as a nifty secret and
the other thing that's going around is

479
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:48,569
that the europeans are now read them
their privacy great call the election

480
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:54,569
every personal data except for security
policing etcetera that that was outside

481
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:59,829
of hitting still is going to be it's not
like they're called the general election

482
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:00,549
regulation

483
00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:08,369
things you need to know fines as high as
300 billion dollar company I'm sure that

484
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:11,280
when that comes around which it will
most people are

485
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,660
thinking that will see a huge file from
Europe guarding our privacy to one of

486
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,200
the tech stocks in the next two and a
half years but you get a poor Billy not

487
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,830
so we get to see something is going to
happen here it's going to go all the way

488
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:35,360
up there and that we'll see if and when
they do then you gonna continue to see

489
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,890
major fines and you're going to see the
general election 72 our data breach that

490
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:45,720
that isn't just an European data that's
how much time you have in the united

491
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:58,049
states but that's a tough stand up to
one of the things I want to plug in here

492
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,640
is the security community the
International Association of privacy

493
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:07,870
professionals as another organization
and we have local knowledge and there's

494
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:11,660
going to be a presentation about
International data transfers both

495
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:16,740
rulings of sick joke data protection
regulation and other issues

496
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,370
upcoming me if you're interested for the
stuff I let me know and then sit back in

497
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:28,790
any position but I know most of the
other people from here I'm sure alright

498
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,380
so what she do I need you now and I
briefly talked about it

499
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,600
implementing security and privacy by
design that is we've been talking about

500
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:44,860
it for the past several years ever since
we've been doing these Issa summits it

501
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:49,370
is now reality simply because the
regulators that when you're rolling out

502
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:56,580
a kind of products you must think about
security and privacy before as opposed

503
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:04,529
to trying to understand what they do
that where you will be transferred and

504
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:11,500
how you got to address this because we
thought about what he did at penetration

505
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,569
and they should prepare

506
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:19,499
for data breach that will happen sooner
or later you need to make sure that

507
00:43:19,499 --> 00:43:24,049
everybody knows what's the worst thing
you can do in a database is tell people

508
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:28,269
all nothing up read more things got 30
not that many things got reached just a

509
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:32,019
little bit and next thing you know
people get fire you don't wanna be that

510
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:38,618
guy and then cyber liability because
that's how you take your wrists and can

511
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:45,559
entirely control I think that we can
realize reality to remove some of the

512
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:56,289
financial IW you have to reach is using
in the finally just don't do it once and

513
00:43:56,289 --> 00:44:04,130
I want to say we will and as usual we do
I know US Attorney like to be the N

514
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:11,630
double vision had a little not be part
of this agreement is signed and that

515
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:22,859
alot and how we have a question when I
think we're overtime jere appreciate

516
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:25,190
your time thank you very much for coming
today
