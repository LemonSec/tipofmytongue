1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,389
software security teams today and the
stuff I'm gonna talk about today

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,900
applies openly and directly to software
Stevens doesn't apply to traditional I T

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,680
securities even sis is really just a
focus on cybersecurity groups of girls

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,140
worries that it because I think it's
important to think about this in a few

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,270
in a different way

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,119
one is gonna say some stuff that you
probably can agree with and that's

7
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:31,410
totally cool but I want to think about
it for a minute because I'm coming from

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,540
a place of trying the sand and water
companies and how did it work very well

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:43,410
and getting the things I need out of it
and the other thing is about what you

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,769
take back to your job because this is
something we forget about a little bit

11
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,530
too often and it's a real TV right if
any of this stuff ring resonates with

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,809
you and then you go back to your job and
you just can't do it the route to find a

13
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:06,170
place right there's a lot of people
hiring right now in this booth during a

14
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,320
walk around this conference let people
hiring right there's no reason you can't

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,839
go find the job that lets you do this
kind of stuff the right way now that

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,299
being said none of this is really all
that groundbreaking revolutionary so you

17
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,350
should be ok but it's something to keep
in mind is something I like to remind

18
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:29,750
people up is a no go to a place let you
be you and let you accelerate but before

19
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,600
we get really into it I want to talk
about the different things we call this

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,929
right here people call a product
security application security software

21
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,180
security as security there's all kinds
of different ways we mention or or or

22
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:46,000
this topic but there's one common PC
that software it's all about software

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,570
writing code delivering code whatever
you wanna call it will start with this

24
00:01:51,570 --> 00:02:00,679
what's the most important part of
software we have any thoughts are with

25
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,380
the most important part of software
should be enough to be an obvious one

26
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,810
delivery software doesn't do anything
unless you deliver it it has to be ship

27
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,909
that has to go into production has to
work it has to do with being make the

28
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:22,530
money do you know the business part
whatever you want caller ID most

29
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,099
important software software delivery you
don't deliver the software doesn't do

30
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:33,640
anybody any good costs money and that's
that's the whole point of this and why i

31
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,929
wanna change the label maker chains and
I wanna start from examining the

32
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,519
traditional state of the industry most
teams that I've seen or talked with look

33
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,319
kind of like this or have a process
looks kind of like this there's some

34
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,260
some development happens it's not over
to a wall to wall get tested over the

35
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:02,459
wall and they get pics are not fix it is
kind of this back and forth there's

36
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:08,359
waiting periods there's a communication
there might be a you know a look at some

37
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:12,920
code and throw PDF back over the wall I
don't know how many of you have a guy

38
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,948
just a PDF and try to fix something
based on it doesn't work very well right

39
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:20,569
you know filing tickets based on that
China try to interpret what they said

40
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:26,948
it's just it's just messy right and the
more you do this the more you know get

41
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:31,760
telephone gets played contacts get
shifted don't get the points of what

42
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,959
both sides during the day and you end up
with something like this right it's this

43
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,299
battle right this wall and it's just you
know one team defending their wallet it

44
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:46,739
seemed you know trying to get through it
I hate this idea has terrible too much

45
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,629
waiting too much telephone too much miss
context not collaboration doesn't work

46
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:56,948
it work it off gas there was something
we could fix here and there and that's

47
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:01,849
that's great but you don't have the kind
of philosophy and collaboration and

48
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:04,060
elite skills and tools you need to make
it work

49
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,220
it's also look like this this is
actually this is what it really looks

50
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:15,579
like you do writes this idea right where
you have security engineering working in

51
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:18,810
the same place on the same team is
really how about to be done in the first

52
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,000
place right

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,650
you have a lot of different team even
engineering teams in any organization

54
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,710
between those different teams when
somebody need something about you what

55
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,190
happens

56
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:38,750
same thing right away right same thing
I'm talking about here talking about is

57
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,680
just another engineering team and being
opposed to just the same problems you

58
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,840
have already this opera security group
is just another engineering that's all

59
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,979
of this right

60
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,550
anybody tell you differently has a has a
different agenda read the whole point of

61
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,870
this is to create software with the
engineering books right this offer

62
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,010
security but also delivering software as
well outside of just you know the normal

63
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,719
security stuff

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,570
question in your organization's how many
of the folks to get hired could pass the

65
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,860
development of you just become a
deliberate organization and you have a

66
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,830
team that's capable of doing that

67
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:26,289
11 hands 1 partial had not this is that
so many questions that kind of not even

68
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:32,090
a point right so I guess lead developer
is maybe architecture role that kind of

69
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:38,890
thing so I guess there's no doubt about
that but the cyber security group should

70
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:44,599
be one of the strongest engineering
teams and we have a guess as to why you

71
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,600
started engineers and put them in his
office

72
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:16,570
it's part of it has a big role in this
encounter a lot of code different a

73
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,099
different times the guy could have seen
it before maybe we shouldn't jump into

74
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,180
problems basis they haven't seen before
and have to understand them and make

75
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,070
choices on them quickly you can't do
that as a junior you have to have time

76
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,659
on your belts experience knowledge you
have to have the skills to jump into

77
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,010
something you haven't seen understanding
quickly and be effective

78
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,610
that's why the most experienced folks
should be in this group

79
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,550
no understanding how systems put
together not just the code level but as

80
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,669
I level right how did this get together
why did it together why did they fail

81
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:49,979
when it put together a certain fashion
all that stuff is really really really

82
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:55,200
important and you can't say time is
really how you get there and a lot of

83
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,070
experience will get the help you get
there faster this is different of course

84
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,900
and I'll talk about the house later but
there's a couple of things that I like

85
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,900
around this that I think are worth
talking about right

86
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:17,789
attention direction respecting
collaboration we're gonna do this to

87
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:22,000
happen pointing in the right direction
everybody has to have the same goal this

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,940
sounds obvious right but it doesn't get
a little more watered down as you get

89
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:33,180
into pointed in the same direction means
you have the same goals a lot of times

90
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,860
security teams goal is to prevent
something from happening right so bad

91
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,880
things are happening or several bad
things are happening and engineering

92
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,370
group's goal is to ship something but if
the engineering group is going to ship

93
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,180
something that might have something bad
happen now we have two conflicting goals

94
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,530
right now the two teams are saying well
I have a goal of not letting you do this

95
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,059
and you have a goal of doing this and
now we have to do this until we figure

96
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:01,380
it all out if you can get people
objectives like that very concrete

97
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,870
objectives I don't let this happen it's
the wrong direction right somebody's

98
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,110
pointing that way and they're opposing
forces gonna talk to each other and

99
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,900
something happens if the goal is to ship
software to deliver software the teams

100
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,000
are working together to get out the door
right it's that sets up a simple thing

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,300
but

102
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,150
it makes a huge difference is both teams
point in the right direction saying this

103
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,830
has to ship so I need both teams do
exactly what I need to do to make sure

104
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,088
the software goes out it delivered on
time which means security team isn't

105
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:33,930
saying you have something wrong

106
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,489
security system there's something wrong
and here's how you fix it or hear the

107
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,190
colors the password right it's it's
helping them go out that are faster does

108
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,329
not hold up its they'd be out the door
if you don't have the same objectives

109
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:50,959
then nobody wins it's not talking forces
problem you have two teams that have

110
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,910
different objectives trying to rip the
other didn't doing the job I made you

111
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:01,380
come across that I was sleeping because
that's that's it right this is the

112
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,320
traditional probably haven't security it
happens everywhere right you know you

113
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,300
have an opinion you have an objective
you have a goal and somebody else I got

114
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:17,490
a ride and so some of its a place of
tensions on the rise of ignoring great

115
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,329
guy I hear you but I'm not gonna do that
right and so hard you try to your way

116
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:33,829
the best way to do this is major aspects
I get some kind of obvious but moving

117
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:37,770
your cyber security group to a team of
engineers means going to work with

118
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,220
engineering team day today every a day
in and day out the folks on that group

119
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,220
could pass a developer interview in fact
I won't hire anybody for the products

120
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,510
that can pass development of you go
there on developing interviews and other

121
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,670
delicacies as cool talk about security
stuff but if we can get past that hurdle

122
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,500
I want to be able to walk in the door
with a team of people who the

123
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,930
development team respects and says ya
wanna work these guys they know what

124
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:09,550
they're doing right end up with a mixed
bag of skills and somebody will say oh

125
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:16,680
yeah right grr to all families but maybe
had been tested and about a third of the

126
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,329
wall of us a lot about to go away and
this happens a few times a few dozen

127
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,310
times

128
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,268
respects these guys keep bugging me with
stuff that doesn't mean it doesn't

129
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,600
matter doesn't even exist ride

130
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,990
and now you have this you start to have
developed this this attitude towards he

131
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,000
was giving you all the time now that
being said some some groups are really

132
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,600
good stuff out

133
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,930
awesome job so that's not the situation
but it happens over time but if you have

134
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:49,819
a group of this budget and by the way
here's a requester patch to fix those

135
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:51,060
great thanks

136
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,819
you know get off my back I just make
sure the code works as intended to rely

137
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:59,349
on it didn't really stop my dad at stop
and do something you know this is kind

138
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,190
of done that's a huge thing right that's
the build up trust the team is on your

139
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,420
side

140
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,420
mutual respect is super super important

141
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,939
unlocks a few things down the road when
you don't have that means respects rate

142
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,180
on each side of this goes both ways
right this is the engineering team you

143
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,008
know getting noise from a security team
or you know a security not trusting

144
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:30,839
engineering right as they keep making
mistakes and that's just it it off its

145
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,439
toxic that's all it straight up toxic
and eventually it'll ruin you so you

146
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:39,790
know if you security team start seeing a
bunch of mistakes the same kind of

147
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,050
mistakes over and over again to keep
hammering the engineering team to fix it

148
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,839
solution is to write a library that
doesn't make it happen anymore right

149
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,529
it's getting everywhere you don't keep
saying this process getting problems you

150
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:55,329
write a library find the library and see
everybody uses library so we don't have

151
00:11:55,329 --> 00:12:00,680
any problems any good at this and they
haven't had problems or that I think for

152
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,300
several years now right they made a big
effort in a long time but they said that

153
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,099
that is the answer to this problem right
makes a picture doesn't happen anymore

154
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,860
it's not about finding it

155
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:17,380
financing it and that's why having folks
that can writes that code matter folks I

156
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,689
can see this pattern recognize the
pattern and fix it

157
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:22,560
that's what really matters

158
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,800
when you have the adversarial
relationships it's it's you know again

159
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:35,209
just throwing stuff over the walls and
this kind of review goes right how many

160
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,270
of you have a situation where the
biggest problem in the room was actually

161
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,400
goes yeah right

162
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
people's feelings get hurt right jobs
jobs on the line

163
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,209
most people will try to do you the best
thing they can trying to do the right

164
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,110
thing they're trying to do their job but
when somebody feels that their job is in

165
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,620
jeopardy because a bunch of stuff
happening they're going to start to

166
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:01,630
naturally want to defend themselves and
eventually you'll get in the way tho

167
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,240
toxicity breeds this kind of
environments where even if your rights

168
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,740
they might tell you to go away because
they just don't want to deal with you

169
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,279
anymore but that's one piece of writing
when you go further in the right

170
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,990
direction when you have that mutual
respect your next to have helped

171
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:25,500
attention and you get what I mean when I
say helping tension i mean that you and

172
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,030
i cant have a knock-down drag-out about
the real details and walk away fine

173
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:34,699
right we can have a strain of shouting
match and disagree but we're doing it in

174
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,700
the right in the same direction not
talking past each other we're talking

175
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,220
about the right thing and we're really
actually getting to the point where

176
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,080
we're going to have a real a real
honest-to-god discussion not about

177
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,450
politics are about who should you are
what date or what it is it's about the

178
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:54,130
details about why this thing should be
fixing really how it should go that kind

179
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,010
of ability to do that only comes if you
trust them to be able to trust each

180
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:02,050
other they have the trust and respect
each other first you don't have that you

181
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,260
can't have this kind of discussions
discussions and and each person holding

182
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,250
some kind of agenda they're not talking
about right now the shed all of that

183
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:14,830
stuff and get to the actual point to
help attention gets you to the real

184
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:21,600
issues the stuff that actually matters
so often in all of our jobs we don't

185
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,680
happen and then somebody say something
you're not going to get that ever

186
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,949
unfortunately it sucks but

187
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,000
try to find places where you can you get
a lot more done a lot more effectively

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,620
when you have that define a few people
you can you can do this and then when it

189
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:43,860
works for people i read the news
articles that so how is the part where

190
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,860
to deviate from standard a little bit

191
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:59,220
testers engineers 1 I've had interviewed
folks on the phone and said you know top

192
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,020
security group is about software for me
for this club or whatever company

193
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:12,170
working at the moment about software
that's not what is it about software yes

194
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:19,310
it is we are you a little while and then
testing rates you been testing that's

195
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,959
that's wonderful I we should do that or
hire someone to do it for us either way

196
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,800
to get done what do you do when it's
over to give you give it to you don't

197
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,469
you filter it out how to fix it you can
you give every other piece of advice

198
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,280
every leg up you can and whatever you
can't fix than you did you work with

199
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,089
them to fix it

200
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:40,690
you make sure you understand next time
you find the patterns and libraries you

201
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,850
know it's it's a it's a huge response
when you have a Pentax it's not just

202
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,110
about over the wall about adjusting and
offering all the solutions they go on

203
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,300
with it and making sure that if it's a
big pattern unified say hey along with

204
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,770
this there was a thing and we're going
to work on this with you guys to make

205
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,750
sure that this pattern just goes away
entire and it's way more than just

206
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:05,890
running at school and then verified it's
all the next steps are never and that's

207
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:11,520
a huge huge thing I understand this is
going to take it and try to fix gonna go

208
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,829
one step further this is

209
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,280
experience and personal opinion but I
think it is actually much easier to

210
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,459
train developers and security minister
train traditional security folks in

211
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:32,050
south China lead time is faster when you
think about the discipline of software

212
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,569
engineering as a whole lot to think
about

213
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:39,400
right there's no language or languages
of choice the frameworks in the tools

214
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,730
the stuff underneath admitted basis the
networking all the stuff underneath it

215
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,460
right before the full stack is March and
it takes a long time to get the whole

216
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:55,050
thing we're talking about the top 10
right we're talking about some of the

217
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,209
basic things that get you out the door

218
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:04,120
you know application security of the web
and mobile there's this focus sets of

219
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,599
knowledge to learn right there are there
are common attacks there are things that

220
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,208
they can look for right away right you
can teach somebody in a few hours how to

221
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,620
find and fix it ticket vending
vulnerabilities in web and mobile

222
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:21,389
applications right there's there's very
focused and you can find those that area

223
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,670
of focus for whatever is your building
and you can go down that road and find

224
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:30,150
very very quick focused learning I think
this is why you can gets the general

225
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,230
general wins faster now it takes a lot
longer to master security just to mess

226
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,150
up engineering

227
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,460
I'm not gonna argue that all the two
different as a plan to take a lifetime

228
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,190
to learn about the basics you can learn
fast and that's where you can get a lot

229
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,020
of average I'm not saying don't hire any
security folks in your software security

230
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,940
group that's kind of silly but I'm
saying you can start a staffer team with

231
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,550
software engineers and at least one one
person who understands security and

232
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,169
train them and mention them right

233
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,350
finding somebody who would have it was a
good engineer and a really good security

234
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,010
person they're called unicorns for a
reason and they're really expensive also

235
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:12,590
most the time you don't have a happy to
pay this person out there and that's

236
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,669
about what they call up I'm not kidding
I tried to hire about these people

237
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:24,240
recently in stock company million right
now you got to bed in them Jesus Christ

238
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,330
ok

239
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:31,790
wow so you know this is this happen more
often most of time they're making a lot

240
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,730
of money and they're very happy doing
what they're doing because when

241
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,980
companies find the potential at John so
it's not about you know taking them and

242
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,820
and and I remembered about building
right we're gonna have to build the next

243
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,460
generation of cyber security group
members that's it

244
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,860
the colleges are not doing it right
colleges are giving you may have one

245
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,419
course on ethics that the lumps in some
security into it and software or maybe

246
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:59,830
maybe once offer security focused course
that just a script or something you know

247
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,669
it's not an education thing to happen in
college it may have happened in a job

248
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:08,180
you're gonna have to build them you find
people that understand the stuff and you

249
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,530
build a team that hiring is hard for
this waiting for iraq to get a little

250
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,530
before you start doing security doesn't
work right to make do with what you have

251
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:25,280
done this I had to try to find folks and
I said ok I'm gonna grab some of them

252
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,910
engineers just go do it and it works
quite well but there's a few things

253
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,890
outside of normal vulnerabilities that
have to happen as well

254
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,870
you cannot do this as a few other areas
of just the normal you know I stopped

255
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:43,489
and I think the train that really really
matter and again this is against Korea

256
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,850
discipline that we are all in this room
have been done before but they're things

257
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,939
not to forget about what is that not
only gonna have a group of engineers

258
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,560
that have that have had a security
background first you have to understand

259
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,389
where things will break into I
understand that look at a diagram go

260
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,950
from a different perspective not why
does not get a scale where somebody's

261
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,710
going to attack us that modeling is
absolutely critical piece of knowledge

262
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,220
that you people I mean I wanted the
entire operation and world about that

263
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,930
modeling because I think there's a whole
bunch of really interesting things that

264
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:20,140
come out of it but really really
important to take this into often this

265
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,640
is kind of misunderstood and and just
skipped over and the other thing is risk

266
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,690
this goes both ways

267
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:35,869
a lot of times we communicate in terms
of absolute right there's a

268
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:40,699
vulnerability it has to get pics and
made it without any understanding of how

269
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,779
it impacts the business what can go
wrong with the losses are i mean you

270
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,239
know I'm not gonna talk about risk at
all that we can get a hold of and

271
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:53,179
subject but a good and and and and
grounded understanding of risk is a huge

272
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:58,729
thing how often do you push the big
button you know the no you can't thank

273
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:01,139
you I'm saying you can't do this

274
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:06,998
stopped right when you when you wake up
and go no we're not doing that how many

275
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:07,769
be done it before

276
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:19,029
what it cost you one that asked cost you
a cost you everything right you can only

277
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:24,759
hit that button a couple of times before
now you're crying all you have to use

278
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:30,729
that very very sparingly nafta know when
the appropriate to use let's talk about

279
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:34,899
why it's easier with engineering group
and other people but that's down the

280
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:35,399
road

281
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:42,139
understanding of risk business impacts
what's going on what the company could

282
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:46,699
make if they let this thing go out the
door today chances are if they're

283
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,929
pushing the business is pushing hard to
get something out

284
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:54,109
gonna make a lot of money on it and
whatever thing you might lose but not be

285
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:57,899
as big as the money they're going to
make on top of this right you might roll

286
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:02,809
greats we can expect a loss of expert
where gets back to you know a profit of

287
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:09,049
why and why is multiples of acts do it
man right that's all good that kind of

288
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:12,580
that kind of mentality has to exist you
have to understand what's going to

289
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,449
happen and what can happen to the
business as a result of their business

290
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,570
impacts right will this disruptive
business or something happens but it's

291
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,899
not just about the loss of what will
happen to the business if we have a a

292
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:30,268
real events this goes is part of risk
but this really is focused on

293
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:34,169
understanding how the business works and
what doesn't work what happens

294
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:40,190
super super critical to many of us
actually and this this transcends the

295
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,110
boundaries here too

296
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,678
even people in this room right we don't
spend enough time with business

297
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,460
understanding what's going on we don't
spend enough time talking with wire

298
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,080
products going to do what it can do
business how much money is going to make

299
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,540
it doesn't work how much the business
losses we don't spend enough time

300
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,740
talking about the stuff it's really
really important so you're gonna build a

301
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,809
well-rounded team this stuff has to
happen right without modding the risky

302
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:07,559
business impacts that's what has to
happen along with decent folks the

303
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:13,080
basics right and this mean these last
three there that's kind of general

304
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,110
security right I can be applied to any
any secure discipline and organization

305
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:24,860
but it's super critical thickness where
you cannot must not get this part we

306
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:31,639
have some additional tools along with
the stuff I've said there's one driving

307
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,679
mentality and if not about saying now
this whole thing is about finding

308
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,630
creative ways to say yes the answer is
never know the answer is yes we have to

309
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:51,929
get their hair done improper for it but
yes ending right this whole thing this

310
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:56,970
whole conversation about yes ending the
conversation you have to be at nothin

311
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:01,160
analogy you need to be able to go into
these kind of job security group should

312
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,179
be there to say yes and to figure out
how to say yes even if it's ridiculous

313
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:10,020
and crazy there's a good reason to do it
and of course there's a good reason to

314
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,610
do it

315
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,409
find out how you say yes somebody goes
I'm gonna stable passwords here and you

316
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,970
think that's crazy why would I do that
they go because it is the pressure to

317
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,860
make some money

318
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,229
ok let's figure out how we can say yes
and still have some safety nets right

319
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,799
maybe that's behavior intelligent
monitoring activity and saying oh yeah

320
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,040
this person looks like this comes on
this device and if it didn't need to

321
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,730
login so you say yes and that's great
but at this time maybe I'm gonna I also

322
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,590
like to do this right I also want to be
able to force in the log and how do they

323
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,590
think there's something fishy going ok
great right

324
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,570
that revenue impacts and still protect
yourself

325
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,550
that kind of mentality is the absolute
must going forward is fighting a

326
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,870
creative way to say yes when you
understand the business and you

327
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,510
understand the risks can you understand
how they operate you can figure out why

328
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,820
yes important right don't just say yes
but only right figure out why it is

329
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,260
important and then say yes it really is
an important if it doesn't matter it's

330
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:13,220
gonna have a lot of jeopardy its
responsibilities they get right there's

331
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,340
there's a time to total lion and really
put the heart-stopping but understand

332
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:26,040
the business is a key to making sure
that you can say yes appropriately so

333
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:33,310
outcomes of this during this a little
bit differently has a different kind of

334
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:40,389
impact hypothesis operate security
groups are part of the process I don't

335
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:47,650
mean you include them randomly because I
mean they're actually part of the day

336
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,460
today discussion

337
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,360
code review like everybody else's their
part of the initial discussion before

338
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,820
any code is written the design process
includes the security groups and again

339
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,629
not because the SDLC dictates it but
because everybody wants them they're

340
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:06,060
right because it goes faster this way
and again this is not because they

341
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,990
require

342
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,710
requirement is one thing and so and you
have to do that right if you are under

343
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:17,400
organizational regulatory constraints on
its own sake doin I trust and PCI and

344
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,810
all the stuff you gonna have to write
gonna have to prove that matches that

345
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,950
and that's all fine and well you gonna
do that for certification compliance

346
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,150
reasons that's not what I'm talking
about

347
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:31,440
that's just because policy right i mean
because they're actually wanted to write

348
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,720
you grab them because you want their
opinion I respect there because they are

349
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,430
want that is exactly why you want them
there right if that's not the case you

350
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:46,080
have to fix it very hard to make sure
that everybody wants them around and

351
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,360
that group is really really respected
our software security group helps ship

352
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,659
software faster that if you're if you're
doing that you're always welcome

353
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,580
gonna make my job easier gonna help me
get this out the door faster you're

354
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:00,960
always

355
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,799
welcome to come around you know it the
honey vinaigrette the character of the

356
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,279
stick it the whole thing right

357
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:15,380
the charismatic but you know that's a
little scary but if you want if you

358
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:26,840
continually help as you walk by walking
by and then invites you know other teams

359
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,090
will start actively seeking the advice
of this opportunity right now if you had

360
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,760
engineering teams comments in cyber
security group

361
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:43,408
what's the what's the biggest reason
they won't be able to feedback of why a

362
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:51,529
team didn't ask the real feedback of my
team didn't ask for help before that's a

363
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:52,419
symptom of the problem

364
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:55,419
yeah

365
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:12,890
just you know there's it's fear right if
I go to this team I'm gonna have ten

366
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,980
times more work to do and I already have
too much work to do I can get it done by

367
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,280
reaching out of this team and a bit more
work but that's not that should not be

368
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,030
the case right

369
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:27,700
done the right way it's done at the
right time you make a little bit but it

370
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,470
can be very obvious why and it's not
going to be a lot of a little bit rate

371
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,640
oh yeah we talked about this in the
design process we decided that it didn't

372
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,070
work for us and we gonna have to go
different routes and so is that's great

373
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,320
to hear that is not controlled me to put
around this because we're exposing

374
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,460
ourselves here and we do it then that's
fantastic right if we wait till later

375
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,460
and thrown over the wall and they go
okay well we got some serious problems

376
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,220
have to rework this now you have a
cheery work they didn't ask up front

377
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,380
they were afraid I was gonna happen now
one month behind because we didn't ask

378
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:05,440
right that fear of asking and it really
that they understand the costs of asking

379
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,420
him really not that you're not alone you
want to be able to fix that control

380
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:14,810
right when you reduce or remove the fear
of what happened when you ask a lot more

381
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,450
but as the other side of it rather go to
ask them because they want them but also

382
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:23,350
been asked not afraid about this is a
huge thing and people will tell you this

383
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:27,139
right is it something you gotta get
openly and freely through much of folks

384
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:32,180
because they're not going to say I'm
afraid to do my job right then I can

385
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,980
point a finger and go they always give
me more work and and maybe if you are

386
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,700
nice people will say yeah this is why I
don't do it but there's no excuse for

387
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,780
that right there's no real excuse you
hear that go you're not doing your job

388
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,180
because you're afraid of not doing your
job right will make you not you do your

389
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,890
job but that doesn't make any sense at
all right there's no there's no logic to

390
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,600
defend their rights of people are going
to be super us about that now if you

391
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,969
have a really talks a group maybe there
are some things you can talk about but

392
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:03,800
in general you're not going to get that
kind of feedback directly or indirectly

393
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,810
and it'll take some time that's that's
due to the cost right I have been

394
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:12,129
fortunate son in some cases coming in as
a consultant and talking to folks you

395
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,100
know 11 saying this has nothing to do
you want to talk to your boss

396
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,330
don't know why and that's my right
that's the answer I guess right when I

397
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:23,668
have no fear of impacts to their job
they start to be honest and then you

398
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:31,250
figure out what it but the real problem
is the outcome here when you have a team

399
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,460
of developers focus

400
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,789
automation you have got to the roof
right everything software problem the

401
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:45,370
problem not always the best thing by the
way but the net is positive right I have

402
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:48,928
to do this thing twice and I'm lazy so
I'm not gonna make sure I never happens

403
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:58,360
again I'm gonna do it this is an awesome
outcome how many of your controls our

404
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,070
automated

405
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:03,639
completely automated process where you
just think you cite them you can you can

406
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,169
show what the control looks like in the
design of the automation and it just

407
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:12,799
kind of happened but that's pretty much
the majority controls not many hands

408
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:20,190
right there should be when you put them
under under under the first thing I do

409
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,070
is ask him a question

410
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,330
API docs

411
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:32,949
can I do the same thing I would do on
the aperture in the in the webpage or

412
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:39,049
whatever and sometimes you know nothing
you have to just kinda

413
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:46,340
thanks API and I can ask him more
details I can automate can take what

414
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,899
they're doing and I can fit into a
bigger process that's also right that

415
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,059
gets me is way way farther because the
theme that one vendor does is one part

416
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:59,149
of the puzzle right if this little piece
but if you go back through the entire

417
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,110
history of what you're trying to do you
want to put the whole thing in one by

418
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:09,570
one of you you at 10 controls you up one
kind of processor and I can't do that

419
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,980
that mean the missing stuff you know if
somebody has to click a button so they

420
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,000
could be sick 1843

421
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,799
indication gonna leave and that no
matter what happened that button click

422
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,010
the control of it right i dont have no
comment as a control as a condemned

423
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,929
automation I really don't think at some
point

424
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:32,759
control if the humans interact that the
performance all humans are always the

425
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:36,869
weekends at the end of the day that's
not so we're talking about ways in the

426
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:43,279
security line anyways but on the flip
side of controls that's a big deal when

427
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,860
you can order me you could have more
confidence your controls test automation

428
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:52,979
it doesn't fail I would too bad but when
you have a system that's comprised of

429
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,990
mostly top developers you end up with
this is an outcome

430
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,929
just how you really have to say you
should automate this that's just kind of

431
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:06,929
a natural happy outcome here is thats
security becomes part of the products

432
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:11,639
right it's a feature that feature of
your products are are part of your

433
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:18,320
product is just security because any
software security group that's also an

434
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,820
engineering team will have a natural
inclination to want to have a product

435
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:29,240
right they won't a sense of security as
a feature of the products they will care

436
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,919
about that because it's just any thing I
have to have something that I deliver

437
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,749
after something it's just that they're
wired that way right I I need to deliver

438
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:41,960
something I'm gonna deliver security
thing that i'm gonna focus on the part

439
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,690
of my property

440
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:50,280
the end result end up looking like real
collaboration right the team over the

441
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:56,800
wall will start to work together when
you have to push the button right and

442
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,780
sometimes you will magically make the
button go away when you have to push the

443
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:09,179
button but easier cuz if you go two
years so or just go to the CSO regarded

444
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:14,909
as we can stop this can't happen right
and that's fine and I'll take that in if

445
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:19,830
you order in the CTO both of these young
we have to stop this because they don't

446
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:23,719
understand and agree that's the thing
that's way more powerful right when you

447
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,250
can grab other execs or other people
high up but also agree with you because

448
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,139
they've been working with you the whole
time I understand that message is

449
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:36,489
amplified it's not to people it's wow
you into organizations are both teams

450
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:41,279
they don't have to stop this right now
hold on power is going to be easy to

451
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,300
push the button cost you less when you
convince a whole other people to go on

452
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:51,620
with you right now just burning your own
political capital coming into right have

453
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:57,990
a co-signer on here and make it actually
ends up being a lot easier when you

454
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,459
start to get people on board like that
that's that's really where power for

455
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,290
that to happen and that's why this
collaboration

456
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,180
kind of interesting right and that
honestly that's why we're all here right

457
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,089
we're all here because I wanna do the
right thing

458
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,990
12 same thing we all have goals we all
pointing in the same direction and we

459
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,089
all try to you know really actually help
each other

460
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:22,570
move forward that's that's the purpose
that's why we're here and that's what

461
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:26,770
about how business wins have just a few
minutes of questions

462
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,530
yeah

463
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:35,299
one is yes he writes the first point you
made about you know you've given

464
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,790
somebody constraint on controlling men
tended to basic stuff and that's not so

465
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:44,009
that's actually where this this this
works really well because you don't give

466
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:49,060
the people and letting the day today
features this problem often critical

467
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,980
problems I solve this problem as a
library that everybody can use and hand

468
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,890
it to them and tell them they have to
use that the software right you put it

469
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:01,220
and you put it that way so the security
controls problems that you have are left

470
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,279
to the daily feature developers assault
that left us offers security group

471
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,810
itself that's the whole point right so
when you put these specialized pieces in

472
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:14,860
a group that's focus on just doing that
they're more effective and when you have

473
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:18,850
a group of people who really are
top-class engineers they know how to

474
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:22,940
obstruct the problem such that they can
sell it everybody right you know things

475
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,930
like crypto you're gonna get it wrong
right and I must you understand and

476
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,850
agree to get it wrong we saw the Apple
just recently right even if they have a

477
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,400
world-class team of people that
understand really how to buy Krypton

478
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,270
they still got it right this is a hard
problem but we have a group focused on

479
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:42,960
going to do the right thing so giving
that group those focus problems really

480
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:50,150
actually helps the net better talking
about the cloud and we can go later I

481
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,340
very much disagree I think that the
cloud offers way better security than

482
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:59,570
any data center out there even talk but
I have a whole lot of opinions about

483
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:04,900
that I would be hesitant to say that the
cloud of the path of least resistance I

484
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,090
think the whole lot of things to
consider their and I'm happy to talk

485
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:15,370
about a few minutes here I think that's
that's a little bit of fun because i

486
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:18,750
think is a whole lot more of that offer
that you can do straight up right away

487
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,120
they give you way more visibility than
you ever had

488
00:38:26,360 --> 00:39:15,410
but I would say calling the bad news is
probably not the right thing so personal

489
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:20,970
opinions I am I i put 0 stocking
certifications they have they haven't

490
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:25,700
helps they haven't gotten any further
along than I have been in the personal

491
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:33,330
opinion only I don't speak for anybody
but myself when I say that but the fire

492
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:37,620
is a good thing you know put him in the
bottom in the role let them understand

493
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:42,620
there's a whole lot of that they don't
know right of course guided you need you

494
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,759
need some guidance there need some hand
holding the process but sometimes one of

495
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,120
the best ways to have somebody I
understand whether it's kinda shocked

496
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,770
the system and go out as a whole lot to
learn and have to give them you know

497
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,259
stuff that's up to go on and of course
you followed up with training and you

498
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,780
and you and you give them time to learn
you have to give them time to learn to

499
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,640
put them to the fire and given no time
to learn that one that won't work either

500
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,890
but yeah hunger programs are the best
because you teach them up the parts of

501
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:12,830
their of your business that that matter
a general boot camp and security is ok

502
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:16,450
and you'll get there but unless they
understand the business and why these

503
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:20,279
particular problems are more important
because the entire class of problems on

504
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,290
a platter business there are certain
class of problems you actually have most

505
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:29,390
often that's a start with the immediate
problems and working out and i think

506
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:33,150
thats my times I'm happy to take more
questions outside but I want to cause

507
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,430
the other people so thank you
