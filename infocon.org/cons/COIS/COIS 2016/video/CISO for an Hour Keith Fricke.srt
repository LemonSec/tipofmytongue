1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
somewhat entertaining and interesting
and informative came up with the idea of

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,719
calling us presentation seesaw for an
hour having been a sea so I thought it

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,860
might be a good idea to share some of my
experiences as a seesaw for a larger

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,080
organization hoping that most of you in
the audience may be aspiring to move

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,490
into a row like that someday and for
some of you that may already be seasoned

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,759
veterans hopefully you'll pick up a
couple of tips along the way I just by

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,440
way of a bit of background have been an
information technology about thirty

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,989
years I started really young 16 of thats
been an information security and 16 of

9
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:48,050
its been in health care I've got a
couple of certifications my last role I

10
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,190
was the chief information security
officer for Mercy Health which is the

11
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:58,539
largest not-for-profit hospital system
in the state of Ohio 24 hospitals 35,000

12
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:04,650
employees pretty decent size
organization I also managed the security

13
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,580
program for the Cleveland Clinic's nine
community hospitals and board member of

14
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,580
the Cleveland InfraGard

15
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,990
the summer learning objectives I want to
achieve today is helping you understand

16
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:24,220
some tips and getting that job as well
as some of the actions to take when you

17
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:30,230
first step into that role you know
because depending upon how deep things

18
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,460
are you'll need to know whether you
should be wearing galoshes or hip waders

19
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:39,440
and then become familiar with some non
technical tasks in the role frequently

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,640
people that move into a row like that
maybe somebody that came up through the

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,080
technical ranks and you'll quickly learn
that there are a lot of non-technical

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,590
aspects to the job that I think are
important to be aware of and lastly have

23
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,369
some words of wisdom along the way as I
mentioned the primary intended audience

24
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,750
is for people that are technical or
managerial level people looking to move

25
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,709
into a sea so roll and information
security officer or director security

26
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:16,990
role you know and everything that I'm
going to talk about doesn't give you any

27
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:24,510
guarantees it's mostly just for insights
I think one of the most important things

28
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,350
in getting the job is focusing on two
aspects of your experience in the

29
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:35,239
interview that has little to do with
your technical abilities and more about

30
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,269
how you can lead people at the end of
the day for getting hired into a

31
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:43,739
leadership role the person that you're
reporting to wants to know can you lead

32
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:49,120
a team of people and also can you manage
projects because an awful lot of what

33
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,420
you'll find you have to do in any
organization despite the level of their

34
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:00,190
security programs maturity is knowing
that you can deliver on projects because

35
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,299
there will always be new projects that
have to be implemented there will be

36
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:06,230
upgrades that you have to do

37
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,810
and the whole assessment process for
filling in the gaps in the program

38
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,799
because those were things that weren't
on the road map perhaps for any of your

39
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:22,310
predecessors I think that you should
make the opportunity to interview the

40
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,470
company that you're looking to secure a
job with as much as they're interviewing

41
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:33,609
you you really want to make sure it's a
good fit it's it's unforgiving job and

42
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,500
it comes with a lot of stress and so I
think what you should be asking are

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,010
these questions in particular understand
what their corporate initiatives are and

44
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,890
that's really a wide-open question and
it covers a lot of ground you'd like to

45
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,029
know a little bit more about what where
have they been where they at where they

46
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,489
heading and that could be anything from
what acquisitions maybe they'll be

47
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,379
looking at they may not be able to tell
you specifically that they're looking to

48
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:07,010
acquire other companies but it may be
good to know that least they're looking

49
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:13,370
to grow because that could add a whole
dimension to your responsibilities in

50
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:19,349
terms of assessing any acquisitions or
mergers and who knows it could affect

51
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:26,750
your job both positively or negatively
and you would like to know if if that's

52
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,370
something on the near horizon you know
why

53
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,260
ok I'm getting hired tomorrow and we're
starting that next week or is that

54
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:39,159
something that maybe 12 to 18 months
down the road beyond acquisitions I

55
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,930
think it's a good idea to understand
maybe a little bit about what sorts of

56
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,110
products and services they not all
already have but which ones of those may

57
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,440
be new or which ones are they looking at
launching because I would hope that you

58
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,400
would be involved in participating in
some of those activities because many of

59
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,179
us have been in a situation where
security gets bogged down at the end

60
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,180
instead of beit din along the way

61
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:12,210
security initiatives in flight now on
the books would be more specific to what

62
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,500
you'd be working on its good to know
coming into that role may be what's

63
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,840
already been achieved what sorts of
things

64
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,849
they aspiring to accomplish and to what
extent are they aware of those things

65
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,490
they may be looking to you to come in
and tell them what they need to do

66
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:35,610
depends on the level of maturity of the
organization asked what's expected of

67
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,139
you in the first 90 days there's a
couple of reasons for that obviously the

68
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,020
most important one is that usually your
evaluation period and you want to do

69
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:51,280
well but also it is good to know what
they're going to expect of you so that

70
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,119
you get off on the right start

71
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,470
you don't want to be heading down the
wrong path and find out that you should

72
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,669
have been doing something differently
based on what they were expecting I

73
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,479
think it's really important to
understand the management style of your

74
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:10,210
boss every interview that I've ever been
on I asked the person that would be my

75
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:16,780
boss that very question I don't like to
be micro-managed I like a boss to do the

76
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,469
two fundamental things that I think all
bosses should do provide direction and

77
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:26,330
remove obstacles if I micro-managed I
won't last long and I like to know what

78
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,030
their management style is now they could
say one thing and be completely

79
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:37,099
different but I think it's better to ask
the question to ask it at all and lastly

80
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:40,830
I think it's important to know where
security sits in the organization there

81
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,750
there's a different dynamic if you
report up through the CEO and I T vs

82
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,950
reporting to risk management sometimes
she sews report directly to the board

83
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,190
sometimes they report to finance
sometimes they report to risk management

84
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:00,990
are legal it's a completely different
dynamic based on where you are in the

85
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,320
food chain and it helps to understand
that context when you're stepping into

86
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,320
that role

87
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,299
assume that you get hired I would
suggest that you confirm the

88
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,710
expectations that were set during your
interview because things may change we

89
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,760
all know that the AHR cycle doesn't
happen right away you may interview for

90
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,760
a position that you actually don't start
for a couple of months

91
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,860
well that's two-thirds of a quarter that

92
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,159
that could really impact what the
priorities are and maybe they've changed

93
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:41,469
so it's a good idea not to walk in
assuming that the expectations that were

94
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:47,310
set are still the ones that exist so
just ask the question is what we talked

95
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,919
about in the interview still how you'd
like me to prioritize my focus it

96
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,530
depends too and if you're taking over an
existing program are building a new one

97
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:01,039
when I got hired at Mercy we were
building an enterprise security

98
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,449
department from the ground up we had
some markets that had a pretty decent

99
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:11,610
security program with people that did
security full time and then we had other

100
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,279
markets where the network engineer where
the security hat when necessary so

101
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:21,529
understanding what you're getting into
is important because it will help you

102
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:26,360
create the strategy and vision necessary
to realize whatever those expectations

103
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,870
are if on the other hand it's a rather
mature program you probably want to be

104
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:38,209
asking questions about well where are
they in a maturity scale is there some

105
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:43,409
sort of framework in place where they
are measuring their level of maturity

106
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,920
and if not you want to get your arms
around now because then you can figure

107
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,390
out what we need to do to help take the
program to the next level

108
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,089
risk assessments would be key seeing if
they have any done taking a look at the

109
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:03,760
results I would hope that if any risk
assessments word on that there'd be some

110
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:11,970
action plans and what's the the track
record of of completing those things you

111
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,750
may find that you've inherited quite a
number of audit findings that need to be

112
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:24,440
addressed and are those tied to risk
assessments at all and also if they

113
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,440
haven't done any risk assessments you
should be prepared to recommend

114
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,990
and some risk assessment framework and
get started and obviously you'd wanna

115
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:40,160
help them help you identify where the
the most important information is and

116
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,350
start with those systems first
identifying budget is important do you

117
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,890
have one what's it look like from a
capital and operating expense

118
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:55,650
perspective and we'll talk about that
when I first was hired the line items

119
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,740
for security we're actually part of the
data center budget because they were

120
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,460
looking to build an enterprise security
program there was no cost center for

121
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,540
security in and of itself so part of the
work that you would need to do in a

122
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,719
situation like that includes figuring
out what your budget needs to look like

123
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,700
and work with the appropriate people to
move existing budget in two different

124
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,640
structure

125
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,140
the other thing I mention is it's a good
idea to ask questions about the history

126
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:31,199
of the budget I found out I get hired
the middle of November of that year and

127
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,550
I found out that there was a line item
for identity and access management that

128
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,469
was about two years old

129
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,380
the capital had rolled over one fiscal
year and then a second fiscal year and

130
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,590
so one of the things that was said as an
expectation is we need to get started

131
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:52,720
next year which was about six weeks in
building and identity and access

132
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,060
management program and making some
investments because if we go a

133
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,229
third-year that capital may not be
available anymore so that became

134
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,790
something that I had to prioritize so
you want to dig a little bit deeper into

135
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,110
questions about the history the budget
and not just know how much money you

136
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,920
have to spend it is critically important
early on to build strategic

137
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,880
relationships it was sort of ironic that
one of the first to people that I met

138
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,900
when I went to my orientation at the
home office where internal audit I

139
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,980
bumped into the two ladies in the
hallway and we struck up a conversation

140
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,790
and

141
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,790
and that was the start of a great
relationship and I'll tell you a couple

142
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:40,170
of stories about that along the way I i
think what else is key is something that

143
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,680
will talk about near the end of this
discussion which is incident response

144
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,469
and building those relationships early
is very important because security will

145
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:56,620
have to work with marketing human
resources legal risk management all of

146
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:02,310
those key areas that are often needed to
be pulled together if you have some sort

147
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,439
of a crisis or an incident to deal with
and the sooner you build those

148
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,880
relationships to better another thing
that I'll recommend to you is after I

149
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,850
started I gotten myself involved in
reviewing contracts from a security

150
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,930
perspective and you can build some
political capital with the legal team

151
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:29,290
because I always turn their contracts
around very quickly because invariably

152
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:35,010
something came across my desk that
require quick response sometimes I had

153
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,310
to rely on the legal department for a
quick turnaround 15 established a

154
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,209
reputation with them as somebody that
turns their work around quickly if I

155
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,710
pick up the phone and call them and ask
them to return the favor they're most

156
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:54,280
likely going to do that for me because
you scratch my back I'll scratch yours I

157
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,680
think that you want to ask this last
question you want to be diplomatic about

158
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,520
it but what you're what you're looking
at

159
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,540
looking for is you know the locus of
power are the people that make decisions

160
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,380
maybe they're the people at the
corporate office and what you want to

161
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,060
ask is you know what do I need to know
about interacting with this you know

162
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,050
certain person whether it's the head of
legal or the head of a char because

163
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,660
maybe there are certain

164
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,290
unwritten rules about how you interact
with those people and early in your

165
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,529
career at this organization you don't
want to put your foot in your mouth by

166
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:37,399
doing something that you wish you had
known about and maybe by asking some

167
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:42,769
people maybe even your boss just say you
know based on your experience working

168
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:46,839
with these lists of people are there any
things I should know about their

169
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,959
management style the do's and don'ts in
interacting with them and that goes a

170
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:59,660
long way in helping you have a smooth
road and transition into this new job if

171
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:04,279
you're building a new program a couple
of things you should consider you'll

172
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,149
probably be asked to define an org chart
like I did I had about fourteen people

173
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:14,060
reporting to me either directly or
indirectly and I came up with this idea

174
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,529
of creating a services catalog if you're
building a new program it's a good idea

175
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:24,829
to have people understand what your
services are so initially I think we

176
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:30,519
broke our department up into three areas
of focus security engineering security

177
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:37,050
compliance and user provisioning and
that helped us focus on where we needed

178
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,149
to place people remember I had some
people that had been doing security as a

179
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,970
full-time job and other people that kind
of wear that hat when necessary unless

180
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,230
you're building your church need to
figure out what am I gonna move people

181
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:54,370
around what opportunities will people be
interested in working for and in that

182
00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:01,060
will help try to solidify what that or
church needs to look like also referring

183
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,199
back to risk assessments and the
methodology that was used as a good

184
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,630
place to start to if this is a new
program and there isn't much history

185
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,279
there it's an opportunity for you to put
your finger prints on that program make

186
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:20,509
it your own and help shape the way it
needs to be you also want to inventory

187
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:24,629
the security technology you want to find
out you know what investments there are

188
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:29,790
when I started at Mercy they had a
centralized logging system that was

189
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:36,279
defunct it was running an old hardware
it had old software and that this were

190
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:41,350
floor nobody was using it so one of the
quick wins that I strove to accomplish

191
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,420
was I needed some visibility and I
thought it might be a good idea to

192
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:51,579
outsource that and we were able to do
that so I got some visibility scored two

193
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:57,300
quick win but it's also a good idea to
understand what the technology inventory

194
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,800
is not just from a functionality
perspective but from an age perspective

195
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,990
because remember I started in November
so in the first quarter of the following

196
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:13,089
year I was already expecting to have to
do budget forecasting for the year after

197
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:18,420
that we'll understanding what the state
of the technology was would help me make

198
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,939
recommendations about the investments
that needed to be made not only in may

199
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:27,880
be replacing technology but even just
doing up greats sometimes upgrades are

200
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,009
more than just the software you get to
the end of life of hardware and you're

201
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:36,519
not necessarily interested in moving to
a different vendor but you want to

202
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,529
refresh the hardware that takes money
and lastly when I understand the

203
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:45,620
operational ownership of security
technology and this widely varies from

204
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,720
organization to organization around the
room and asked people to share with

205
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,100
their organization look like we probably
get a lot of different answers sometimes

206
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,839
the security department manages the
firewalls sometimes it's the network

207
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,740
team you know you could run down the
list of Technology understanding who

208
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,439
owns what is important especially when
you tie it back to that earlier slide

209
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:16,399
about building relationships
communications is the big one this is

210
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:20,849
where some technical people that come up
through the ranks struggle because you

211
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:26,129
have to be good at communicating
technical ideas and issues in a

212
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,710
non-technical way and when you're
interacting with people at your level or

213
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,659
higher

214
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:38,409
you know these emails meetings phone
conversations and text messages are all

215
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:40,760
different methods of communicating

216
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,570
they all have their own etiquette but at
the end of the day they have one thing

217
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:50,950
in common we need to try to boil down
the issue or the communication in

218
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:56,550
simplest terms and as you move into a
sea level role you'll find this for

219
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:02,270
yourself it's very difficult to keep up
on all the expectations of you and so

220
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:09,780
you appreciate when people communicate
with you in a concise manner you

221
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,500
probably want to ask some people that
you interact with frequently at that

222
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,920
higher-level what kind of information
they prefer to get from you and how

223
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,990
they'd like it because then you can
tailor your communications based on what

224
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:29,720
they're looking for some people like
more detail than others and you want to

225
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,750
err on the side of caution and keep
things concise but if they're interested

226
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,680
in more information over time you can
kind of develop that expectation and

227
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,530
rapport because what you want to avoid
is striving to be concise and then find

228
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,660
out that they'd like more details so you
wind up getting emails back from them

229
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,220
asking questions will can you go into
this or can you go into this and

230
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,740
sometimes it's easier just to pick up
the phone and one rule of thumb that I'd

231
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,260
like to try to follow if possible is if
it's going to take more than three email

232
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,780
exchanges why not just have a
conversation cuz it's a lot more

233
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:11,070
efficient so again learning how much
detail as a novel based on a

234
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:16,629
communication medium obviously you can't
communicate as effectively in an email

235
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,660
as you can on the phone and texting is
even more limited

236
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,639
want to come back to building
relationships for a minute especially in

237
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,980
the context of communication rather
interesting thing happened when I was at

238
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,130
Mercy I mentioned that I started
building a relationship with the

239
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:42,780
internal audit folks what the time I
wanted to look at bringing in some sort

240
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:48,490
of a risk assessment tool that was
quantitated based and we wound up

241
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,870
selecting fair I had jack jones come in
for those of you that know him and run a

242
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:59,590
two or three day training course for me
and my team I invited risk management

243
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:05,699
and internal audit to that training I
paid for their seats and I said to them

244
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,049
the only expectation and I have of you
is that you sit through the training if

245
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:15,250
you can afford the time and just learn
about the tool that we're planning on

246
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:20,640
using if you find that it may be
beneficial in the work that you do I'll

247
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,200
budget for licensing and pay for it but
if you've already got something that you

248
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,010
want to use thats fine and that was well
received and Internal Audit and Risk

249
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:36,250
Management did attend both of them
declined to use the tool not because

250
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,090
they didn't like it but because they had
other things that they were already

251
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:46,020
using well unbeknownst to me at the time
I laid the groundwork for something

252
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:51,120
really important internal audit did an
audit of the data center and they

253
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,590
brought in a pretty high-end tool that
spit out one of these big reports and it

254
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:04,360
ranked something finding as high for all
the servers that had this obscure I'm

255
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,549
not gonna go into the detail of it but
it has a somewhat obscure vulnerability

256
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:15,240
well I wasn't sure I agreed with that in
fact I knew I didn't agree with that so

257
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:21,970
I did research I wrote a report I used
fair to prove that if we fixed what they

258
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,520
asked us to we would actually cause more
problems in the environment

259
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,270
and I think what helped was not only
having a solid argument against fixing

260
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:38,990
it but because I used fair and they sit
in on the training they understood the

261
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,460
story I was trying to tell them and they
change the audit finding the low that's

262
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,310
a good day so I called Jack and told
them about that success story I think

263
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:57,990
it's important as a new leader that you
establish regular communications with

264
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,030
your team I remember shortly after I
first started I called a phone call

265
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,660
meeting with everybody because we were
all spread across the state of Ohio and

266
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,200
we actually had somebody in Tennessee
and just you know kind of introduced

267
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,180
myself and talked a little bit about my
vision and some of the things that I

268
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:20,590
thought we needed to address an
accomplished you'll find and for me

269
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,959
especially having come from the
Cleveland Clinic where everything was

270
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,100
about an hour within each other all of
our meetings were in person and this was

271
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,879
a completely different dynamic because
my team was spread so far across

272
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,510
geographic region all of our meetings
not just security but I T and general

273
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:44,360
we're done on the phone so much
different dynamic to get used to and so

274
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,600
it's even more important to keep that
line of communication open where

275
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,740
possible I had weekly meetings with my
direct reports and I tried to get

276
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,250
involved in some committees and it may
be a good idea to start some committees

277
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,870
when I was at the Cleveland Clinic we
created something called the information

278
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:09,669
security technical advisory forum called
that I staff for short and we held that

279
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:15,380
monthly and we invited people from the
security department keep people from my

280
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:20,690
tea and some of you especially if you've
been in health care you know that

281
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:27,080
oftentimes these shadow I T groups exist
where a department has its own funding

282
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,199
and enough clout in the organization
that they hire their own I T staff so we

283
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,030
wanted to try to get those people coming
to our meetings and we also had physical

284
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,629
security com

285
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,570
what was interesting about the Cleveland
Clinic and it's still true is that their

286
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,760
physical security force has legal
jurisdiction in the entire state of Ohio

287
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,760
because they get people you know we get
at the time when I was working there you

288
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,600
know they'd get foreign dignitaries
coming for open-heart surgeries and

289
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:00,139
things like that I'm so they needed a
police force that had that extension it

290
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,780
was good to have them on our meetings
because we get to share information

291
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,060
about what each other was doing so
starting those committees is another way

292
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,780
to build communications and
relationships so for some of you this

293
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,320
might be very boring because it's old
hat but I didn't want to make any

294
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,620
assumptions so just talking about
budgeting for a minute

295
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,449
you know you need to know your fiscal
year allowing the calendar year or is it

296
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:33,290
one of those situations where the the
budget cycle runs from July 1st to June

297
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,610
30th you know that can make a difference

298
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,449
you know the definition of capital
expenditure vs operational expense

299
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:46,210
capital is typically an asset and you
want to work with your finance

300
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:51,170
department understand what their rules
are for what can be capitalized and what

301
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:56,750
can't I T side you'll often find that
they identify certain value of the

302
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,020
equipment or software that you by where
it goes from being an expense to be

303
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,010
capital

304
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:08,310
the other thing that's important to know
is that in some organizations they may

305
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,210
allow capital to roll over to the
following year

306
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,700
other ones may not operational expense
never rolls over its always

307
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:22,430
incurred at during the fiscal year so
that becomes a forecasting gotcha you

308
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:28,150
want to make sure that you know that if
you're forecasting some sort of let's

309
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,630
say you're gonna buy next-generation
firewall and you're buying a three-year

310
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:37,000
maintenance contract you want to be able
to forecast out three years what your

311
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,070
capital and operating expenses will look
like because the operating doesn't roll

312
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:46,220
over and if you don't budget for that
and yours 2013 you will have a budget

313
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,380
deficiency and that's not good

314
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,930
the same topic in a cruel is something
that can catch you if you're not aware

315
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,660
of it so it say that that
next-generation firewall has a

316
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,540
three-year subscription and three-year
maintenance those are operating expenses

317
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,840
every month over 36 months the finance
department will take 136th of that

318
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:16,250
against your budget but if you pay for
all up front that's cash flow but on the

319
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,650
accrual side you need to make sure that
when you're doing your budget

320
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,660
forecasting for the following fiscal
year that you put one third of the cost

321
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,010
of that in your budget because when the
finance department takes that out of

322
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:35,070
your budget each month that will hit
your budget's bottom line one

323
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:40,840
interesting thing is traditionally
labour is considered operating expense

324
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:48,110
but some organizations will allow your
workforce to be capitalized if their

325
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:52,610
labor is being applied to a project so
you need to make sure that you

326
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,639
understand that so that your capital
budget for projects includes labor is

327
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,520
your capitalizing it and you'll also see
some reduction on your operating expense

328
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,950
because the salaries of those people
that work for you

329
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:14,130
that are being funded as capital for a
project will reduce the impact of that

330
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,680
on your budget and then managing a cost
center

331
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:23,430
you know you you'll work with your I T
department and your finance department

332
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:28,050
understand what all of the numeric codes
are for your budget so that you know

333
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:32,750
which things get charged which budget
because you'll likely be approving

334
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:38,080
purchase orders and invoices and things
like that and then I think it's

335
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,850
important to know the style of budget
accountability at the Cleveland Clinic

336
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:47,510
they manage things to the penny but the
CIO at Mercy liked to manage things more

337
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:53,850
a slush way so that overall there was
responsibility for the budget and

338
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:58,600
meeting it but there were some
flexibility

339
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:04,389
in how much money one part of I T was
spending versus another because if there

340
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:09,230
was an overage on one side it may be
irreconcilable because you could

341
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:13,090
identify that there was some slush
somewhere else because there was under

342
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:19,549
spending there and then some things to
think about in the first second fourth

343
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:25,929
quarter of your fiscal cycle it's not
uncommon for in the first quarter

344
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:31,100
finance want released capital until near
the end of the first quarter so if

345
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,080
you've got project plans you wanna make
sure you understand it because if you're

346
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,539
forecasting that you're going to start
some project shortly after the new year

347
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:45,539
assuming that you are fiscal year aligns
with the calendar year but funding isn't

348
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:49,510
available on the capital side until
three months into it

349
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:56,520
your project may wind up being three
months late right out the gate Q-two is

350
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,020
interesting because in that same
scenario the flood gates open at the

351
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,400
beginning of Q-two so there's this
flurry of spending and then finance will

352
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,309
typically look at the financial health
of the organization at the end of the

353
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:15,020
second quarter and depending upon how
spending is going and how revenue is

354
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:20,299
they may start cutting back allowing you
to spend more money so you get this

355
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:25,340
three-month window to try to get some
things done and then the last thing I

356
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,770
mention is it's a good idea to have a
plan in your back pocket about things

357
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:34,470
that you'd like to do if you had extra
money because sometimes in the fourth

358
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,610
quarter that's what happens somebody
makes an announcement we had this money

359
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:44,000
that we need to spend the first person
that can step forward with a project

360
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,679
that we can review and approve gets the
money so if you've got a couple of

361
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,510
things in your back pocket that you can
respond to an opportunity like that you

362
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:57,549
may be able to spend some money this
year on something that you had

363
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:01,820
forecasted next year because you were
prepared to talk about that

364
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:08,510
department meetings building
relationships again is important what we

365
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,590
eventually did in my department was we
met four times a year

366
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:19,120
typically in the first quarter and third
quarter we did a team

367
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,649
phone call that lasted a couple of hours
and then the other two times of the year

368
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:29,299
second quarter fourth quarter we had a
big team meeting we got together and it

369
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:36,309
was typically a full day but the night
before we all went out to dinner and you

370
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:41,379
can build some great relationships that
way the meeting agenda was really the

371
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:47,000
same for me you know your team is going
to be heads down every day fighting

372
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,010
fires and keeping up on project demands
and they will forget over the course of

373
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:57,408
three months or six months just how much
they accomplished and my team always

374
00:30:57,409 --> 00:31:01,880
appreciated it when we reviewed all of
the things that we had accomplished

375
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,850
either since the last meeting or in the
past six months and they're like wow no

376
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,000
wonder we're so tired we really got a
lot done and I forgot about doing that

377
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,240
and then the other thing is looking
ahead so it helped set the stage for you

378
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,029
know they've got them excited about what
we accomplished so that we can talk

379
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:28,260
about more work that was coming up I
think it's really important as a leader

380
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,250
to know how to run a good meeting how
many of us get invited to a meeting by a

381
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,870
person that we just we roll our eyes are
like we're never gonna get anything done

382
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:41,168
in this meeting so here are some of my
tips you want to send an agenda out in

383
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:45,390
advance because there are some people
that are introverts and they would like

384
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,850
some time to digest what you're planning
on talking about instead of being

385
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:57,439
surprised when they show up the format
that I like to follow at times is here's

386
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,059
the list of topics we're going to talk
about and here's the times that I've got

387
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:08,330
allocated to it people respect you when
you manage a meeting to a schedule and I

388
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,699
would say that you know skipping the
minutes for a moment talking about the

389
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,500
parking lot

390
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,120
this is a really good idea because if
you're trying to be a good leader and

391
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,209
run a good meeting and you want to stick
to your agenda there may be some great

392
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:27,070
dialogue going on and there may be some
ideas that get thrown out that are

393
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:32,550
important but aren't necessarily germane
to the topic if you create a parking lot

394
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:37,600
and make a note of that it lets people
know that you value their input their

395
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,129
ideas are important and that this is a
topic that should have its own meeting

396
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:47,640
you'll find that people are more willing
to share in a meeting when you ask them

397
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,600
to come up with ideas if you're making a
parking lot it's a good idea to take

398
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,510
minutes

399
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,580
whenever I was running minutes our
meetings I took my own minutes and I

400
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,800
always put action items at the end of
the minutes and then for the next

401
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,159
meeting

402
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,920
action item review was always the first
agenda item because it fosters

403
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,420
accountability you can ask people what
their statuses and after a couple of

404
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:16,480
times of heading meetings and people
give you the same answer why haven't

405
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,490
gotten to that yet you can rely on those
relationships you been building and go

406
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,870
back to that person if they're on your
project team but they don't report to

407
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:30,409
you directly and ask for some assistance
from their boss and how to help them get

408
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,639
the work done that you need them to

409
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:36,639
gaining consensus here's a tip that I
have found to be effective

410
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:41,859
it's rather subtle but it makes a big
difference if at the end of a meeting

411
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:46,949
you're trying to get some consensus and
you ask the question is there anybody

412
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:52,799
that does everybody agree with this
decision

413
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:59,779
people will tend to feel silent peer
pressure if they disagree and so they

414
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:03,619
may raise their hand and say I agree but
then they walk out the door saying

415
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:09,589
there's no way in hell I'm agree to that
if you ask the question is there anyone

416
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:14,629
they can't agree with this you're giving
them permission to disagree and it opens

417
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:18,879
the door to discussion because then the
follow-up question is what will it take

418
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,109
for you to reach consensus so it's a
subtle way to open the door to

419
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:28,518
communication and that will help make
your meeting more effective because you

420
00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:33,219
least have some confidence knowing that
when people walk out the door what they

421
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:40,328
said is what they meant performance
reviews is a part of your

422
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:45,079
responsibilities and you'll have to set
goals that align with the company with

423
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:49,599
the department and what the individual
you heard Darrell talk this morning

424
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,779
about the importance of training and I
agree with that to the extent that the

425
00:34:54,779 --> 00:35:00,410
organization will be willing to fund
training take advantage of it I think

426
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:04,109
the only thing worse than training
people and having them leave is not

427
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:10,098
training people and having them stay
there can be a detriment to your program

428
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:20,160
we don't have time you may find that
there are formal employee engagement

429
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,740
surveys that take place in your
organization and some of your department

430
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:31,569
goals may be tied to the outcomes of
most things and they will typically ask

431
00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:37,529
you to identify two or three things that
are areas for improvement and maybe

432
00:35:37,529 --> 00:35:42,119
there would be one thing that you see is
a strength and what can you do to

433
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,769
sustain that so those are some goals
documentation is very critical

434
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,740
have to be very careful how I share this
story with you but i i think it's

435
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,649
definitely worth telling

436
00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:00,789
documentation is very important on the
positive side of performance reviews its

437
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:06,910
good to capture emails and other things
along the way throughout the year that

438
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:12,089
reflect positively on some of the people
that report to you because you're going

439
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:16,500
to forget about some of those things and
if you document that you can pull them

440
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,980
out at the time of performance review
and it not only helps you formulate your

441
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,970
answers to their review but those are
good things for you to share with those

442
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:31,399
employees during that performance review
and it lets them know that you thought

443
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,650
that the things that they did were
noteworthy were important enough to save

444
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:42,210
so that you could you know talk about
them however it's also important to

445
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:47,640
document conversations that you have
with problematic employees because you

446
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,578
never know what's going to happen I
guarantee you that nobody's gonna pull

447
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:57,900
you aside and say hey guess what this
one person that's underperforming in

448
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,710
your department has been getting meets
expectations for the last five years

449
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:08,789
because their previous boss rank them
that way and so when you start to

450
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:14,509
document conversations about that person
and for two years in a row that person

451
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:18,809
gets a needs improvement and doesn't get
a raise and pick your poison

452
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:26,390
whether they file a complaint with H are
based on age race or gender you're gonna

453
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:32,319
be in the hot seat to show that it's
none of those in fact this person wasn't

454
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:39,270
a good performing employee and you have
to hope in my case that when this

455
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:44,180
problematic employee met with leadership
within the first five minutes that

456
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,980
person put their foot in their mouth and
it was very clear that there was a chip

457
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,610
on the shoulder and had nothing to do
with whether I had an issue with that

458
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:59,070
person's age gender or race documenting
is very important and if you've not been

459
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:04,070
through something like that before you
don't want to have to turn that

460
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:09,280
conversation into a he said she said if
you've got documentation that shows here

461
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,440
are all the issues that we talked about
here are the actions that we agreed upon

462
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:19,470
you've got a very solid foundation to
stand on to defend yourself if something

463
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:25,549
like that happens and lastly you want to
provide some sort of career path for

464
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:32,650
your team to the extent that you can
talk about projects for a minute I think

465
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:38,570
it's very important to know how to do
project management I'm forecasting if

466
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:42,340
you're not familiar with the
methodologies where you're doing

467
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:47,890
personnel ASUS or even doing things like
the standard deviation of a critical

468
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:53,660
path of a project it will serve you well
the quick story we were one of the

469
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:58,109
projects that we had was a rip in
replacing the friction my predecessor

470
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,840
purchased an encryption product and
threw it out to each market to implement

471
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,640
and we really needed it to be
implemented in an enterprise fashion so

472
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,100
we sat down and we did a time
forecasting analysis and we estimated

473
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:17,880
that it was going to take us about see
fifteen months and after we applied some

474
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:25,970
of the the mathematical analysis to the
project we extended the project by 11

475
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,730
weeks because we had underestimated how
long

476
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:32,130
it was going to take and what was
interesting was when I said that what my

477
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:36,070
boss and went over the length of the
project he said why didn't think it was

478
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,730
going to take this long and I said well
that's because as humans we tend to

479
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:42,620
underestimate how long it takes to get
things done

480
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:47,109
night in say this to him but I'll share
it with you why is it that in

481
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,940
organizations we don't have time to do
things right but we have time to do them

482
00:39:50,940 --> 00:40:00,010
over and I would rather build that into
my project plan up front and as fortune

483
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:05,590
would habit halfway through that project
we had a reduction in force and a number

484
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:10,590
of the resources allocated to the
project were gone so over the next

485
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:16,590
several months we started falling behind
because this was a compliance project we

486
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:20,900
had to pull resources in from the
outside to help us get it finished and

487
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:26,180
it took about an extra two months so
despite the fact that the project came

488
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:31,089
in late think about if I had not done
that forecasting analysis with the

489
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:36,060
scientific methods we had added three
months to the original and now we were

490
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,240
two months late behind that so otherwise
that project would have been close to

491
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:46,490
six months later the two most difficult
security projects in my opinion are a

492
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,689
rip and replace of encryption and
building an identity and access

493
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,670
management system

494
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:56,000
expect project to take time I mentioned
that there was a line item in the budget

495
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,250
for an identity and access management
system we spent four years working on

496
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:06,240
getting that up and running and we were
successful we integrate it with our help

497
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,649
desk software and IT automated a fair
number of things for us

498
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:17,160
you want to expect security program
maturity to take time it in a five and a

499
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,589
half years I was a sea so we
accomplished a significant number of

500
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:26,040
things we closed a hundred and twenty
audit findings we built a pretty robust

501
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,210
security program but those things take
time they're not going to happen

502
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,160
overnight

503
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,750
you shouldn't expect that of yourself
and hopefully the

504
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:39,230
organization you're working for doesn't
have that unrealistic expectation as

505
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,650
well and also you know reduction in
force

506
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:50,000
affecting project schedules I already
mentioned an example where that's a risk

507
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,250
that you always want to cite in your
project charter and you know I put trip

508
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,830
it's up here again because you'll find
that there may be some people on your

509
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:03,210
team that are really good at projects
versus the operational stuff so maybe

510
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,840
you want to lead them towards doing
project implementation for security work

511
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:14,549
couple of tips they have for you i think
is security people sometimes we missed

512
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,480
the boat when it comes to opportunity we
always want to strike while the iron is

513
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,560
hot after something bad happens but let
me tell you a story that was in the

514
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,640
other direction so we had an incident
that required an internal investigation

515
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,980
and we had a good outcome there was no
issue but one of the reasons we had a

516
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:37,580
good outcome was because I had
visibility into activity on the network

517
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:42,480
based on our login system when I sit
down with my boss to be briefed him on

518
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,870
what happened I said to him you know you
know if this same situation had unfolded

519
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:54,310
this way we wouldn't have the kind of
outcome we might have here because we

520
00:42:54,310 --> 00:43:00,000
don't have visibility in these areas and
he said well what do you need so I put

521
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,940
together an analysis to get budget
funding to increase our Splunk licensing

522
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,640
so that wasn't a case where something
bad happened but I told the story in a

523
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,150
way that helped me get more funding
despite the fact that something bad had

524
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:15,830
happened

525
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:21,549
innovative thinking can sometimes pay
you back handsomely so it was about ten

526
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:27,030
years ago this month when I was at the
Cleveland Clinic that I i realized a

527
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:31,820
major success in my career I was
thinking we spent time rehearsing

528
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:37,290
disaster recovery and we would send
teams of people out to some third party

529
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:42,060
company and we would rebuild our systems
why don't we do hands-on incident

530
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,900
response testing so I came up with the
idea I partnered with

531
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,430
net curtain from Inter hack and we
created a laboratory environment where

532
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:55,549
we had real equipment staged and we
staged a live hack and we had management

533
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:00,420
there and technology people there and
you will learn things in a hands on test

534
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:06,030
that will never come to light in a
tabletop well the following year we

535
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:12,880
cooked up this scenario where we had a
person working in a lab department

536
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:19,750
selling patient information to a private
investigator and just for fun we had the

537
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:25,570
lab person on the incident response team
so they were an insider that knew what

538
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:31,900
was happening as the investigation was
going underway so five years later I'm

539
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:38,090
at Mercy how and we had a real insider
incident fortunately it all turned out

540
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:39,220
good

541
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:44,270
the person that was the bad actor was a
third party vendor who only had access

542
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:49,550
to test information so there was no
patient data exposed but having

543
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:55,180
rehearsed something like that in the
past it sort of felt familiar and I

544
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,990
think it helped me better lead my team
through that investigation now it's easy

545
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:05,410
for me to stand up here and tell you
what happened in three sentences that

546
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:09,450
investigation took every day of six
weeks before we figured out what

547
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:17,589
happened now might might point to you is
it's just like disaster recovery we put

548
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,910
it off and put it off until it's in our
face and then nothing else matters

549
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:27,810
make the time to rehearse incident
response because it's going to happen in

550
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:31,000
some way shape or form and you want to
be prepared for it

551
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,390
building a peer network is helpful
especially when you get into a position

552
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:38,910
like this upper management last few
questions like what's everybody else

553
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:42,540
doing if you've got a network that you
can reach out to you can make that

554
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:48,910
happen within the first year I was at
Mercy I found out that mercy is

555
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:55,180
religious-based organizations as you
might suspect the CIOs across the united

556
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:02,210
states formed a Catholic hospitals a CIO
network and one year they invited all

557
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:05,539
their sea so stay calm and so while I'm
there I'm talking to a couple of other

558
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:09,420
people and I'm like what spin off our
own group so we wound up having a

559
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,619
monthly phone call and we just talked
about you know what are you concerned

560
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:18,690
about what you working on so you know
you may even use a conference like this

561
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:22,089
to start building some relationships
where you start to have a phone call

562
00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:27,288
like that periodically and I think one
of the most important aspects to

563
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:32,170
developing your security program is
incident response as I mentioned you

564
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:37,839
want to have plans we have in both at
the Cleveland Clinic and mercy we built

565
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:43,700
playbooks for specific scenarios there's
a different type of response for a

566
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:50,049
denial of service attack then there is a
phishing attack and even you can get

567
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:55,349
granular when it comes to malware some
malware will flood your network like

568
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:59,619
back in the day when sequel slammer did
that's a completely different response

569
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:03,920
than somebody discovering that there's
malware on a workstation extol trading

570
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:10,890
data versus ransomware having a playbook
helps you make decisions under duress

571
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:16,629
and give you guidance that helps keep
you focused and test those plans when

572
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:22,039
you can you want to tap into expertise
where and when you need it unless you're

573
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:26,859
a large organization that can afford to
have a forensics team I think it's a

574
00:47:26,859 --> 00:47:32,930
good idea to outsource that only because
if if you present evidence in court by

575
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:38,799
people on your team that collected
information a sad be opposing counsel

576
00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:44,089
we'll ask you or ask your team is this
something that you do every day and if

577
00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:48,299
the answer is no they can shoot holes in
the credibility of the information that

578
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:53,519
you collected strengthening those
relationships mentioned earlier so

579
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:58,319
here's another interesting tip that was
another hands-on exercise I did I was

580
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,880
teaching my team

581
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:05,750
the value of how to document an incident
because you never know if that

582
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:10,839
information is going to appear in court
later because maybe the incident starts

583
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:14,538
to unfold in a way that you quickly
realize that you've been breached so

584
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:20,400
what I did is I i set up a scenario
again I work within her hair done this I

585
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,720
left the room for most of the day and
left the team do some acquisition and

586
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:32,730
collection and then the following day we
staged a mock deposition and I was the

587
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:39,410
one being deposed by a real attorney who
had he discovery experience and shot

588
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:44,420
holes in all of their documentation and
the lesson learned there wasn'ta give my

589
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,309
team a black eye but the problem that I
see is that the technical people will

590
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:53,710
collect evidence that doesn't get used
in court for six months or a year maybe

591
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:59,769
and so if you've got good documentation
practices it helps you recall what you

592
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:05,368
did that further down the road and plus
if you're being questioned about things

593
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:09,769
that you did not necessarily collecting
information but even just the decisions

594
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:14,129
that you made it goes a long way and one
of the other things that I'll share with

595
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:18,180
you in terms of the documentation when I
mentioned to you that we had that

596
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:23,480
six-week investigation I made a note
every time a conference call started

597
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,170
with a vendor and when it ended and that
really helped me out because when it

598
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:33,059
came time to pay all the bills and they
were sending me invoices listing all of

599
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:37,710
the times that other people spent I
could go back and look at my notes and

600
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:42,269
because I had remembered to write down
when the call ended I knew how long they

601
00:49:42,269 --> 00:49:43,508
were actually on the phone

602
00:49:43,509 --> 00:49:49,060
those are things that you don't always
think about any questions

603
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:58,049
had some takeaways from this discussion
thanks for letting me share my

604
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:58,710
experience with him
