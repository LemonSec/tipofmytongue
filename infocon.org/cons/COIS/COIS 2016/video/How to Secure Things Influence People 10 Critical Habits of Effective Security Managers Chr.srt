1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,750
bring stock fell learn more about all
his three and how to check so not fun

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:14,099
stuff we appreciate everybody does a
little bit about 30 minutes you don't

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:21,970
know jack about dive right in and failed
at about what why where he ran over this

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,799
topic

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,900
both of us we talked to a lot of
security guys around for a while and

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,719
then we heard a lot over and over

7
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:46,530
people complaining about that there is
not that they're very right they can't

8
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,300
get people to do the things they wanted
you don't report me just say man are you

9
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:06,100
so much easier so how are they getting
stuff and I was really why doesn't

10
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:13,500
guarantee so you what are those people
doing the following them to get back to

11
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:22,650
meet with them run a little bit from
covering the copies of some of those

12
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:34,720
things we learn from those leaders
though the company having Cleveland west

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,140
side for twenty years

14
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:50,600
and you'd be very involved in some
podcasts concept form the fireman we'll

15
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,070
talk about that later

16
00:01:52,070 --> 00:02:55,640
so I don't see so shocked that they are
actually part of my house was 155 lbs

17
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:15,040
challenge so we got stories for all of
these folks we've been telling stories

18
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,650
together and we found some common things
in the first one was listening and sure

19
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,650
everybody vehicle leader

20
00:03:26,180 --> 00:04:09,359
he looked not not just a matter of life
and death or personal or professional

21
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,889
person persons professional

22
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:38,719
separation so that was really fast and
if that doesn't happen then I realized I

23
00:04:38,720 --> 00:05:15,409
had a really good person so this is a
reader I was running in her system

24
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:26,280
backup figured out how much you care
about

25
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:58,139
homeowners should someone who are
overweight thank you you could have hit

26
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:40,240
their highest the right phone icon will
start where he was a really want to help

27
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:54,820
her first thing was was now although

28
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:37,240

there are always wear your role in my

29
00:07:37,240 --> 00:08:01,370
house every morning and every one of you
and your reaction to rationalize why

30
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:10,020
after the white house with project

31
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:44,939
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah right now

32
00:08:44,940 --> 00:09:12,800
negative negative room everyone set now
for now he created and how you should

33
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,620
never done this is the people

34
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:45,870
negative 2011 coordinator arrived today
that way so what was going on here they

35
00:09:45,870 --> 00:10:13,750
want to be able to grow the next table
so this one is a person who got to know

36
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:31,370
all about and Chris should go over
everything you're doing and you know

37
00:10:31,370 --> 00:11:20,920
until I get into this thing was trying
to retrieve a program here so you know

38
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,370
what was going on

39
00:11:29,170 --> 00:12:02,130
there's certainly a multi-racial working
but say ross department now that's a

40
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:42,300
major material that it would be a
problem we all know that every dollar

41
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:57,010
drivers

42
00:13:22,480 --> 00:14:07,370
they live there is a tool to call you
should really why they gotta ask you a

43
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:31,300
question and that's what I understand
what my state requirements now work

44
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:47,229
based on that so he would understand
your stakeholders using this really I

45
00:14:47,230 --> 00:15:19,470
don't remember we were really are
indicative only passed all my way all

46
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,470
the way home so you know

47
00:15:23,600 --> 00:16:29,120
lady hurt her or her property and he did
it because it's like you work at it for

48
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,120
lunch

49
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:56,519
holes of his relatives

50
00:17:27,689 --> 00:18:09,230
person I don't know why you are so
problem and there never was a lot of fun

51
00:19:24,740 --> 00:20:28,220
so far it was very good and also was
coming with their thinking about is the

52
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:39,679
reason person I put this hard so right

53
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:55,929
riders or things are hard

54
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:43,059
so this was an interesting story doctor

55
00:22:45,779 --> 00:23:57,979
understand where you're trying to do so
I really like to understand how we're

56
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:47,820
gonna be alright alright alright so
through both server so

57
00:24:50,900 --> 00:25:15,120
just half the day tomorrow we now have
just said no

58
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:48,480
get out here where vast projects that I
compromise or so probably wait and see

59
00:25:48,480 --> 00:26:17,650
how you are not so I don't think
everything jackson-lee about his first 5

60
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:29,720
I'm gonna build upon that in 2006
anybody's work with this is my having

61
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,820
spent a long time consulting in April
right

62
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:43,810
my job is literally the smartest guy in
the room a room that's right I find the

63
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:48,370
same things you probably because you're
really good at something else

64
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:58,540
upper range tonight seat on the outside
of my key but somehow it got better be

65
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,629
positive background

66
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:12,950
your battery and given you so far and
the thing that I heard from a lot of my

67
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:20,200
ninety that was kind of going through
the process right doesn't matter how

68
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:27,510
smart murder matter how great you are
when you execute all the other people in

69
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,230
the room

70
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:34,160
top form thanks try to get the room how
smart you are in power proclaimed they

71
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:40,330
probably don't want you right there be
one of the most part of the process of

72
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:48,090
developing so this is what I learned
pretty hard right partner up with

73
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:54,240
everybody else around you you have to
evolve in the process and destroy her

74
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:03,250
from arkansas ended down through someone
you don't know his second story we're

75
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:09,890
not talking high so anybody's ever being
something hines brown gets a little mix

76
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,020
in the bag

77
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:17,370
report out a pen to draw a blank in
there and you makes everything up and

78
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:26,350
got her hand somebody behind company had
a great idea why are we actually got our

79
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:41,370
eggs mixed up and we are worried about
keeping the focus and people didn't

80
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:48,629
understand it will be found is a sort
out what the problem is when the addy

81
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:55,970
they felt like they were big when they
don't listen to the pan think this felt

82
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:02,020
like they don't mix into a pain but
haven't had their process made them feel

83
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:12,350
more part you need to give opportunity
because I R you

84
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:19,350
let them have their a pic and it's gonna
be harder but you cannot wait or you

85
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:29,049
bring them here is my brownies and over
anyway I thought very good so it's got a

86
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:40,879
room that's what is a good one present
security especially I keep it simple we

87
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,710
a lot of us are getting here we're good
at building complex solutions what got

88
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,650
us where we are

89
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:56,630
securities complex problems can you
convert system makes us good job over

90
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:04,820
here and that the story of my life how
he managed to bring some snow coming

91
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:11,490
into an organization I looked around and
Mike man its all time consulting

92
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:20,970
volatility management framework of some
sort of scared all over the place so I

93
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,000
can stand for network in on our

94
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,820
or go every single runs in heavy trading
system

95
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:41,809
hurting bad and actually yeah yeah
that's got by the way it's a corner

96
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:52,539
somewhere in a laptop and I think step
back alright so I don't have a budget I

97
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:58,690
don't have a car press release a video
about what's good enough to accomplish

98
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:06,390
not what's the purpose of it but what
was it about it

99
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:14,789
well we're not doing anything but I
haven't had a look around across that

100
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:30,309
are everybody shared some time there and
I end up working right now it's by no

101
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:38,760
means we all in all this they were
coming anyway hey you know the police

102
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:46,370
here are anything but they're refundable
SharePoint site that coupling they're

103
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:55,309
saying all right hand written stuff I
don't have only want it but I had with

104
00:31:55,309 --> 00:32:02,350
proof of concept said how many my case I
can go after I could build the progress

105
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:34,139
of execution so something we've seen a
lot of guys we get so here we just stop

106
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:45,520
sending personal information how do you
know if there's a problem for him but

107
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,980
they're not my fault

108
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:55,750
and then what we find him to get
approval for a hundred practice that we

109
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:06,540
finally get to go ahead with so you who
requires that all stumble will have an

110
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,649
action-packed forward and then I think
it's really important

111
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:19,990
opposite direction you are a lot of
court now problem hopefully the issues

112
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:29,669
that are gonna get by him to doing
something about you happy that you can't

113
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:38,520
get away with this group not only are
very very got approval for the project

114
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:48,620
you're trying to push forward to make
sure it's happened isn't very rare in

115
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:56,719
the part of the reason why you're
probably didn't get it happened and I

116
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:07,390
just think it's also important not heard
from being talked about his mistress and

117
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:18,750
their space so that execution some sort
of a nice guy but how are you doing

118
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:24,810
have a plan have a project and how so
how to make sure that you're going to

119
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:29,168
make sure that we're moving along the
way that we're getting better because I

120
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:34,759
don't want to be in that position I
think we did you know is I think it

121
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:44,429
better than the white as I bought in
2010 how much better is something better

122
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:47,429
that way

123
00:34:49,239 --> 00:36:26,118
everybody's here you can I do to see you
and nobody in that room look at

124
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,640
themselves

125
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:38,060
I think I should be responsible for that
that's a little bit of a gap that I felt

126
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,830
like I start with you need to hold
yourself accountable you may or may not

127
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:47,259
be an officer may not be purchased
online but you need to look at it that

128
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:51,130
way doesn't know a lot of water at some
point the finger elsewhere you need

129
00:36:51,130 --> 00:37:01,750
their help me there by the time you get
there by God and I think we do a little

130
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:10,440
bit of yourself how to get here on early
prime are taught to me that really

131
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:26,230
doesn't like me wrong I'm safe you have
that feeling like a five minute walk the

132
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:37,260
top so never once heard word do as I say
nobody gets lonely nights anywhere but I

133
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:47,300
don't mean that while his right person
this this probably thought you could do

134
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,810
in practice right

135
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:54,790
give you the right I think it's
important to try to put that equation to

136
00:37:54,790 --> 00:38:01,810
right to tell people that were right he
should be the first one right I don't

137
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,170
you know people who is traveling
throughout the system

138
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:14,020
about the network and let them do their
job was working at work for them that's

139
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,750
something that I've done the past where
are we now

140
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:23,530
process when I saw about six months
later I had a little bit more of a moral

141
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:28,740
high ground they knew I'd suffered not
having some of the right thing I don't

142
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,200
think that it was a lot easier than if I
can say you know what I need a big deal

143
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:48,618
it's important to me again for yourself
at home in his sober black and sounds

144
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:52,260
very kind of new age he isn't here

146
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:07,160
things so much about that right carries
in quite a lot of the people around you

147
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:17,200
things I could be doing that for one of
these really resonated repeat with the

148
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,480
only person who can pull over and
everybody else they might change your

149
