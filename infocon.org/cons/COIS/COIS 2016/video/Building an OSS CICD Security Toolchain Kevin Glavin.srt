1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,859
for tonight for sure if you're so
inclined I am strongly considering the

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:14,620
background so I started in the industry
for years ago during the justice system

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,720
spoke the United States Air Force and
you want to do

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,400
security whenever some generals of
commission got leaked out from a breach

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,580
the kind of thought maybe he was
certainly the software security thing

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:33,019
and that's been a big software security
that the transition from development

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,000
software security and then into are
going to be discussing today so that's

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,730
what do it as well as high school to get
picked up along the lines so for me to

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:56,169
understand as well as love it if you so
just quit Chopin's developers to sing

10
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:03,430
that UPS want to practice their skills
the ability to read know what I mean

11
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:13,570
security practitioners hey i think is
the lap-band hands which is even better

12
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:23,030
drilling down a little bit like a
securities dealing with actual a source

13
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,979
code would you level applications parity
rate that's awesome

14
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:34,630
network security helps them to me is
that what about it

15
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,869
honors

16
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:46,930
wasn't too bad nobody is a promise made
in the house

17
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:56,639
understand it does I'm gonna put this
looks ok so hurtful and lifecycle really

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,110
briefly so it's kind of course of the
years from a very big long process so

19
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,300
water already have a very long design
phase in a very long could face and

20
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,520
testing phase very small incremental
steps for each little bit of change in

21
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:23,360
the code can actually happen in one to
two weeks and even daily and going into

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,800
production systems in a very short order

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:33,880
days and we will cease to have to switch
schedules and it's seen as the benefit

24
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,890
of doing security reviews in the room

25
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:52,339
how long is your typical organizations
such as if you're an enterprise you

26
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,170
don't have a lot of different answers

27
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,680
dealing with a lot of israel says . ok
for dinner

28
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,709
haitian security reviews I read

29
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:24,540
yeah yeah so if you weren't you a
comprehensive security standing and

30
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:32,160
reputation problem especially during a
meta-analysis of course current annual

31
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,799
emissions testing you think you're
pretty brave and try to cram

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,980
233 Spring his challenger

33
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:54,610
acutely principles of the market still
see the increase in rates were generator

34
00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:02,820
who didn't vote will be close to you
actually we have some pics are closed

35
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:10,310
and tests for us a lot of snow per test
passing feeling that you love making

36
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:19,988
simple mistakes were the pictures thanks
a lot of the rest of discussion and

37
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:25,659
hopefully we're going to take that you
are conditions of practice some snooze

38
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:41,600
integration of women here so that the
modern development lifecycles and fall

39
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,130
we've done from reading the system to
creating clothes so every created a

40
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:56,320
system focus on one very small part of
the overall software and that is

41
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:05,300
reflected shooters president change will
be had in fact across the entire

42
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,300
landscape is probably will too nicely

43
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:24,650
ok so what exactly is so when I say she
talking about two different CD is

44
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:40,349
continuous integration Jenkins rotor
familiar with Travis but using some the

45
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:52,280
workload this semester mister jenkins
has any other outliers there in a big

46
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,719
city create a great scripts with you
there

47
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:01,830
so does he like rules have been more
traditional used even in Bartlesville

48
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:09,240
man rate formula testing testing
integration testing so we can leverage

49
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,930
some of that technology and just a few
slides you help us with securities fraud

50
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:19,419
that's more traditional credit security
testing software testing that refused to

51
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:22,669
sing in life cycle

52
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:29,210
concepts when you were concepts are you
as delivery and limit states so I looked

53
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,479
into his delivery as requisite

54
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:39,280
delivery catching up or whatever is
going to run system he's not my career

55
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,380
services architectures service-oriented
architectures period being able to pass

56
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:53,550
those into a little ball object is the
delivery of it so they can take that are

57
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:59,930
in fact that everybody is jar but said
Iran containers nation

58
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,800
ok for dr.

59
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:16,950
other more modern how great a little bit
we have something that we could then

60
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,950
take a decision that's been growing
production and going into production

61
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:28,349
pushing that out through system or other
person had access to those three things

62
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:39,600
are very distinct you have their own
definitions is so I see is going to help

63
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:46,960
write secure rather than as Dirty
practitioners for the development of

64
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,140
what I mean by that is that really you
know how many groups like to hear that

65
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:58,690
they're being out of the printing thing
everybody raincheck season nobody likes

66
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:07,680
that the Securities is whereas the
adversarial relationship times we sort

67
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,400
of winning that really leverage CSP
technologies

68
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,479
well help developers earlier actually
pretty secure

69
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:24,070
that's not going to pose as a
stand-alone abilities future so we want

70
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,430
to make sure we're building

71
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:33,789
voters were used to perform if you have
had a drink since users and TeamCity

72
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:40,210
users in the room today if I say okay
that's great I'm security and we just

73
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,800
don't know what you're talking about

74
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:54,959
he's tried to Cir everything you do when
you play how many of you there were no

75
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,670
worries just not raising the question
like it right so familiar with the tools

76
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,139
to help us

77
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:09,670
get into other developers something very
trust and then use the technology to

78
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:18,719
help develop so really feel secure in
their opponents but we don't overwrite

79
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:29,139
ever since to not be so great that
culture security doesn't inhibit so it

80
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:34,899
was good for sure hands how your
organization is all about security to be

81
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:39,519
a production deployment of security
failure at some point we're not going to

82
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,239
production company could do that with
some scale

83
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:57,529
guilty so organizations don't have much
more risk appetite and they'll say we

84
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:01,809
have any possibilities might go into
production which tends to grow that

85
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,899
adversarial relationship a bit intense
not very well with

86
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:13,169
be a more modern development
methodologies like a child like only he

87
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:14,579
was there

88
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:21,229
strap operations things out we might not
do you begin a review for their delivery

89
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:26,419
schedule is right and we can't do that
would you answer the phone and get a

90
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:36,519
little antsy and receive someone else
entire career so I was thinking that

91
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,999
reminds

92
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:49,039
moving to delivery pipeline is shifting
that mindset we have 2 30 so we can wait

93
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:55,699
for a security review production into
something with a little bit more results

94
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:59,238
show so terrified some security
vulnerabilities

95
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:04,120
everybody take over however

96
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:13,960
so these other low but for these
categories lighter while this way

97
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,990
howdy folks in the rumor sure that
they're not pushing any production with

98
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,610
other people

99
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:32,300
ok yeah sure so weird positions come
back to me and say we can't prescription

100
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:40,099
for the principal the answer is no way
you're already believe daily production

101
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:49,020
facilities in it you just don't know it
snowing in the past we have to know

102
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:58,110
about it for the russian some some cases
handling mission-critical systems maybe

103
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:11,370
that's good but he's going to be
processed hurting so that's all well and

104
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:17,670
good from a philosophical perspective we
could certainly be at that time about

105
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:23,160
the technical perspective how we can
make some of these things happen so what

106
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,050
is this will change

107
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:37,270
talking about rates as royalties they
closed for its really rely on speed very

108
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:44,529
quickly built in his be tested were did
you go out

109
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:59,370
production for users to do that we need
to have testing to ensure their security

110
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,670
people getting the exact same thing

111
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:07,060
security checks in place that are
automated and manual was once again very

112
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,160
very 2006 long time and it may not fit
in with the

113
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,540
like change is going to be composed

114
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,150
tested for functionality for surgery

115
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:30,960
debts to a package that and then were
able to make certain that you will scan

116
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:47,090
and then this is a text but there's a
ton of stuff out there these great so

117
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:54,730
Jenkins being used for many different
steps you might have different version

118
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:05,650
that I get asked a yes or no

119
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:22,010
management customer information we have
you want to get all the schools just

120
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,960
four things will be different

121
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:29,560
shops you might have mismatched you're
all over the place we need to take over

122
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,910
the those that are out there and you
have to get them working together into

123
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:47,209
the sea was literate pipeline is also
extremely pleased that so we can stop

124
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:59,600
the process the process as often as
possible to get so this is an example of

125
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,120
a chance so we have multiple steps just
kind of

126
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:17,279
little water but it will just take that
circle the Saturday so we're good for

127
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:24,350
version control we have to build a
performance reasons languages test could

128
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:30,570
make sure thats posting review test
duration test their decision about

129
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,950
whether or not the crew is helping push
that to a pre-release environments in

130
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:42,089
the ocean so we're really check security
is an almost every single step one right

131
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:48,300
here and we can do many things so there
is no checking or static analysis they

132
00:15:48,300 --> 00:16:02,390
say that no fruits are things that are
familiar term paper its previous four or

133
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:09,900
five games for sedition and through
their also options which are visible

134
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:23,199
bullet wound up today you can have a
deeper level or maybe a more lengthy

135
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:35,570
standing ovation could get committed to
you are working to rebuild manages this

136
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:40,600
is another interesting place we actually
injects goes beyond so you know so far

137
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,060
the things that worked really well let
me answer for the past two years is

138
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,599
they're doing very rapid deployment
schedules they found

139
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:57,930
covering their faces well formatting

140
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:05,929
superficial feedback which they
automatically security was watching

141
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:09,809
things really well appreciation testing
and dynamic now

142
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:20,480
earlier answers that earlier works there
is one of the things to do this creates

143
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:27,550
a unique functional integration test
strategies we have security units has

144
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:35,770
just testing for use cases you can be a
certain somebody sends us a process for

145
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:43,100
our system knows how to handle it
doesn't bring her back and users the

146
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:53,320
same things and then also applying some
concept of Russian test so once again

147
00:17:53,320 --> 00:18:01,889
nobody's replying through deliveries not
know about the report so we find those

148
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:07,690
things with her mother protesting or
else in this horrible he wants to know

149
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,540
about it

150
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:14,000
re-introduce the exact same thing that I
feel like we'll be pretty bored

151
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:26,030
concept of security regression breaking
down and things will work equally great

152
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:37,809
everyone's using some sort of I he makes
this point I will kindly ask so

153
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:43,240
different visual studio whatever it is a
lot of plugins

154
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:55,070
introspection into a coach and teammates
not historically security oriented and

155
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:02,350
some good news is that these tools are
accessible voter baby you get like to

156
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:14,230
make the treatments yourself so you will
find it depending on the area have

157
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,710
mentioned is capable of finding day
before the application rates

158
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:27,539
identifiers that minor security
vulnerabilities and we'll talk about

159
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:51,059
that just there to build automation you
the most my friends gonna see what

160
00:19:51,059 --> 00:20:03,750
somebody's doing it every day

161
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,010
yes there as well

162
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:15,350
Pakistan has this amazing

163
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:25,830
box with the system but it will be
driven from the command line drive

164
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:31,789
something from the command line you can
pretty much killed and a change so long

165
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:40,799
as we can execute the tickets childhood
in a standoff with building these

166
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:54,080
teaching them how to integrate other
which is so saturated tools so we will

167
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:06,149
be down here Tuesday of shrimp boats for
a job in particular has covered the job

168
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:16,760
of being so these are great because to
do so if you don't have a budget

169
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:25,508
or desire or whatever the reasoning is
crucial to like each PMS addition

170
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:28,070
coverage isn't

171
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:40,570
once you can actually go up there you
have made for elections may of course

172
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:55,089
options will return your software for
summer as he never did so with a free

173
00:21:55,089 --> 00:22:09,729
open-source software is open source
software so why is that anybody watching

174
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,889
some constraints we can use it

175
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:28,039
reforms that way but he also operational
yet and neatness so weak and write a

176
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:35,989
recommendation that takes time is money
rate so there is a cost associated with

177
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:42,579
three cool as well and cost me just be
the time to take this probably also

178
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:51,019
include time to research how to clean
and bright first place

179
00:22:52,269 --> 00:23:02,309
identified then still believe that there
is a balancing that when we get a

180
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:14,279
possible to get a free open-source
change from end to end but you sort of

181
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,669
sense

182
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:32,270
so that my scanner and then the
commercial options

183
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,520
ask a standard web site really any
number of options open source and

184
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:49,830
commercial heaviest hitters ok so we
talked for a bit and I'll be itself

185
00:23:49,830 --> 00:24:07,949
Belleville options one thing that we
talked about as well hello TDCi CD and

186
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:22,159
obviously with the three stacked on top
of one another word for differentiation

187
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:40,549
between static analysis and dynamic
models they require more than anything

188
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:40,870
else

189
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:50,739
were so do everything through statically
static analysis with us now a result to

190
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,720
make some decisions there the next day

191
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,390
relies on two years to liberate dynamic
analysis we need something to be able to

192
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:11,539
deliver our arrival so on a meeting and
everything else is using her as well as

193
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:17,429
a reference architecture go along with
with some of these concepts while back

194
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:22,630
using doctor containers for that
position so we can get to the static

195
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,830
analysis point Jenkins Jenkins those
home run our unit tests are static

196
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:32,418
analysis and it knows how to package
reputation so later and the UN

197
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:40,530
another kind of product key feature for
NCD pipelines

198
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:49,770
service discovery using service
discovery tools that ok so maybe her

199
00:25:49,770 --> 00:26:02,030
know if they weren't hers is as far as
popular products they'll have a hostile

200
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:08,180
getting some traction in the world and
what possible as is that service the

201
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:16,910
service discovery let's say how we're
services how you a running machine and

202
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:22,750
then that she announced her every system
hey this is the service today at 11

203
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:28,970
dislike future US Court right and then
we can use that knowledge from our

204
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,840
dynamic analysis tools armor penetration
testing workflow to go out and say where

205
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,730
the service they need to test will tell
us the version the location for greater

206
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,930
need to know

207
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:54,160
test that applications and the knowledge
from this or what we end up with this

208
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:00,180
point it's pleasure was all your results
per unit tests are functional tests

209
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:06,870
arbitration test results from dynamic
know but there's no real way to you that

210
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,899
holds together

211
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:15,820
typically what unfortunately things that
are seen most of my clients doing is

212
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,290
building some custom decision

213
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:27,680
scripting steps that data and say okay
once again finding stop

214
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:36,950
injection attacks became good Russian
but we have anybody over static analysis

215
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,940
users in the room what is your favorite
funny I've got on

216
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:51,950
actual results from this day is going
how many of you actually have a job

217
00:27:51,950 --> 00:28:00,260
ok so what's it was a good one you've
seen he's just the way we just ok that's

218
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:04,910
perfectly fine so what are the
legislature to see a lot of her get

219
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,570
passports so are you know

220
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,590
specially if your public warehousing

221
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:21,720
from somewhere probably get repositories
if you refuse to use force like that so

222
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:33,050
many of the problem so hard to get
things right thing we don't have to do

223
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:46,240
that since news from that perspective
right but it is still got regular

224
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,660
expressions running pulitzer passwords
regular expression probably for things

225
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:57,990
like pass which tend to be reserved for
languages break for portions of scripts

226
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,150
these are what are the nations that
might show up

227
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:08,880
findings might not wanna stop the
presses or something like that might

228
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:18,800
still very popular in those results but
to keep in mind is that it's so it's a

229
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:28,090
risk you know how severe as well as our
way in this finding we were doing

230
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:34,340
fashion yet to make sure that you're not
shelling out twice falling over time

231
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:43,300
find ways around it you can afford this
undated find an exception process so

232
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:55,090
that learns and as much time as possible
what we've done here or so anybody have

233
00:29:55,090 --> 00:30:10,030
any questions using continuous
integration technology transfer Jacobs

234
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,030
and 63 what about thirty years to learn
that stuff

235
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,250
continues to plummet

236
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:33,420
pushing their wife system we find it
still growing rapidly growing trend but

237
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,420
certainly not there

238
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:51,510
you take anything away from today to
your CICS what would you do that you're

239
00:30:51,510 --> 00:31:23,750
at your are currently around

240
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:47,680
choice they're taking we're doing about
talking about all we have time to the

241
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,040
bank

242
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:59,510
well I'm just a little bit he has any
questions that they'd like to dress for

243
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:12,770
price thanks everyone for coming out of
this thing comes to be happy to respond

244
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:24,900
but what we came here in the following
up there
