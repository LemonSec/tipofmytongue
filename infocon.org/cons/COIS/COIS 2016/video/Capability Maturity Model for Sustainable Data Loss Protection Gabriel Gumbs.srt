1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,460
told me what slot I was disappointed but
the list of things I felt about this one

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,760
does it really lend itself well to a
five o'clock conversation that's ok we

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:20,380
try to interact with each day I prefer
to keep most of the purpose is for you

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,160
to do something and we'll quickly
something from your peers as well to

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:43,280
which is also its not just listen to me
so feel free to ask questions and get

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:01:01,440
started building the model almost a year
ago and it took that long

7
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,369
the first thing I did was reached out to
a number of my friends in the

8
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,900
information security business owners I
knew that well but they were subject

9
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,890
matter experts in in either the security
and or in data are two things like that

10
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:24,130
as well as a couple of film stuff
actually had not known at all but I

11
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:30,119
thought they would also be well versed
in it up and lend some of their

12
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,290
expertise to it so I got to folks like
last helping build a program through a

13
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,880
couple days that they might know you
might not have you ate less diplomacy so

14
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,210
it's yours online he's still pretty
active you'll see I'm talking quite a

15
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,548
bit yes a lot of experience in this
field as well to my buddy call from the

16
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:54,340
University of Oxford next I really love
you get some insights into the way they

17
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:00,350
do things in one of those industry
practitioners that energy to say unlike

18
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,600
my Google a few things will get a lot of
high-level talks with 45229 care for

19
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,038
folks into the how to of security holes
with you folks that

20
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:18,800
bill that covers all domains security
but most importantly he opened it up to

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,190
the entire communities everything that
they feel documented you name it

22
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,980
the University of Oxford has put it all
on the website for consumption in one

23
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,760
big toolkit under the Creative Commons
license as well too so close that I've

24
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,829
actually done now to three times in my
career when doing these kinds of things

25
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:50,790
to help with that i truly not done so I
wakes you spend a couple seconds on in

26
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,910
the background about the IP address
security for a little while now and a

27
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:59,870
large part of that is gonna see her as
an architect and as most ethical hackers

28
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:09,830
go for a while

29
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,020
ran armed security company for a bit too
is everyone do that in his youth as

30
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,000
directed didn't feel it was a really
good time to quit your job and started

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,010
doing security is not paid nearly as
well but I learned a lot and learned a

32
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,720
lot about how to do things not just in
the environment so I've been working

33
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,690
with but more specifically how to take
that information and translate into new

34
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,340
environments extremely quickly so I
spent a couple of years

35
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:48,160
slipping away and big farm up and I
realize I need to get back out there

36
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,340
just gotta relax for a bit so I'm
delighted crude product strategy for

37
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:59,680
identifying their we are a data loss
solution provider I'll stop there let

38
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,030
you know that first and foremost a model
is vendor agnostic we'll get to that you

39
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,560
see exactly why house next year the
reason why I reached out to all of my

40
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,760
patients also be intellectually honest
is needed not just be something that

41
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,269
that was built biased for the purpose of
driving a specific agenda

42
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:27,330
run the entire model there is one to
touch points of activities that we

43
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,240
directly let ourselves to versus the
entire things you'll see how that kind

44
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:45,389
of hangs to get time like the mix it up
on the floor of it so that all of the

45
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:56,930
large boxes we about 20 sort this out
PSA's like to get together and mixed

46
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:05,849
martial arts gym so many of them there
are security practitioners that are also

47
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:23,009
shows every go see this but we're just
getting started

48
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:36,969
just how wonderful I am just jumping
into the model because it is so little

49
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:41,880
complex and it's it doesn't begin to
lend itself well to just hang on and on

50
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,490
post it educational series through my
organization webinar do about every six

51
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,740
to eight weeks the third one in the
series actually go through the first two

52
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,520
are an introduction to dance training
program second one building to security

53
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:11,580
controls into and in the final one is
the model basically how to get from you

54
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:19,830
sure you don't need to have any of that
information to participate repeated the

55
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,279
reason for that is pretty much
everything we do is scary practitioners

56
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,419
and one way or another

57
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,960
comes back to carry

58
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,870
that that is the reason why we have all
of the other initiatives that we

59
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:40,680
endeavour on whether they are thrilled
to get whatever the case maybe with the

60
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:48,169
exception of maybe some of the malware
purposes for stealing resources much

61
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:53,990
every other attack one way to lend
itself to ultimately getting some even

62
00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:01,960
argue that access the resources and
thinking especially like the group came

63
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,580
to fame last year before when they were
selling like $2 serves as you can

64
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,370
services but even those although they're
stealing your resources it's for the

65
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:19,270
explicit purpose still another resource
be alright so maybe it's just long

66
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:26,169
enough to hear that the CIA tried to
security and solut technique but the

67
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:30,090
availability of data is also something
that needs to be preserved and so even

68
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:39,820
if not City area those types of threats
are very important for us to the model

69
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:48,090
she get to see the threat modeling and
touch it and get you asking the audience

70
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:54,090
but that more so I just really quickly
threw out some of the data security

71
00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:02,960
touch points in how you slice it into 12
that means they probably all other

72
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,430
things like this comes back to you today
the scary but when I look at the

73
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:16,969
responsibilities that I have similar
roles in that you yourselves or have

74
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:23,169
different places where the industry
itself intersects with all of the other

75
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,169
domains of security that that you are
you are never enough

76
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:35,199
outside of the obvious hanging the
process between all these things

77
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,510
together as we're extremely tired of
smiling those processes which security

78
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,409
operations group is solely responsible
for responding to incidents or maybe

79
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:51,100
monetary or DLP solutions then you may
have you may have a point of all of you

80
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,570
I am stuff and I don't have your screen
artists are all our own divided up by

81
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:00,000
both worked in a number where although
they may have all rolled up into one

82
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,220
responsible 8 the operations room with
architectural group was very separate

83
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,139
from the identity I'm not going to argue
whether that's good or bad

84
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,769
some environmentalists are you know
there is it appears what was necessary

85
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:21,790
to make sure that the process these
great we'll hang together all those

86
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:41,899
organizations this number one question I
get so more are you know if your

87
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:47,360
organization who is responsible for data
so I don't just be information Davis

88
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,660
curious to see what group is possible
that I treat security and compliance

89
00:09:53,660 --> 00:10:13,689
with mighty mighty Department 4:32

90
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:34,449
I tried to tell me what does that tell
me about the responsibility of data

91
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:42,180
security tel aviv find something else
though so I used to research group for

92
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,050
white house security for a number of
years

93
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,389
money with their reports the last two
years we said we were going to go and

94
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:55,660
look at activities vs outcomes to see
whether or not having any effect so we

95
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,839
went out to our target customer base we
went out to lunch and outsiders

96
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,660
thousands of those we had a list of
activities throughout the the the SDLC

97
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:18,329
news the software lifecycle compared to
be doing person out to face came out

98
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:22,219
that one of the most important that came
out of it is a lot of the best practices

99
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:28,819
were thrown around they were having some
certainly work so we get to this point

100
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:30,500
our responsibility

101
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,110
here's the one thing that they come out
of the use of those research that

102
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:43,389
clearly shows and improving IT security
whenever there was a central university

103
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:49,230
that was responsible for Africa's
security was the only thing that we

104
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:59,459
measured that have the same activity
across this particular to ensure yes it

105
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:04,128
is that the model has been developed and
I'm like to make it a bit more before I

106
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:08,139
do something take it up to the community
and and perform that action these verses

107
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:13,300
outcomes exercise but I'm willing to bet
that the same as going to come back

108
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:23,610
responsibility does have the greatest
impact on who is responsible is lots of

109
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,370
the people responsible

110
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:34,170
it's everyone's responsibility everyone
is not responsible for the scene and

111
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:41,099
that's just how to get hung up in units
like what are they responsible for me to

112
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:49,940
get into actually building security
policies that are based on the model

113
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:57,120
will get into where one built from the
resources manager Colin work at his team

114
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:06,240
over already completely built in
Freeview have nothing to a unique such a

115
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,060
great starting point we borrowed some of
that and made it a bit more accessible

116
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,310
to those that are not just an indication
that the truth is hired PCs are really

117
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:24,020
good example of an organization that has
just about every type of data a happy I

118
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:33,589
they have PCI they are vendors and
inside the university level numbers

119
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:39,980
they're taking a box of credit card data
cafeteria folks do they have thi

120
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,720
research universities have lots of
healthcare information and health

121
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,300
information on this data types that most
of the other enterprise organizations

122
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:57,640
that I work with it so another reason
why I like homework because he has no

123
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,650
choice

124
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:06,100
all of those different datatypes the
only thing that makes making slightly my

125
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:15,010
here are some of the more obscure forms
of intellectual property but so will

126
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:24,610
talk about how we may want to deal with
that but it's certainly not necessary so

127
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,610
responsibility to increase output

128
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:35,269
versus possible quality the day he traps
than the standard by the owner's

129
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:38,370
responsibility has that responsibility

130
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,800
producers have a different set of
responsibilities very well should have

131
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,740
policies that dictate how they handled
the generator they're the ones that were

132
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:56,310
consumed with first-line data generated
it and then finding its way outside of

133
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:10,459
control that place and then there are
others there are other talks early too

134
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:29,018
but but ultimately everyone is going to
have a need to be taught what to do and

135
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:34,120
what not to do that's not going to
happen by itself so when we really knows

136
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:40,240
policies we are explicitly make coast is
clear and there's no reason to the same

137
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:47,769
spot as soon as a vice versus although
everyone to consumed in the back and

138
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:52,820
will be home but the responsibility of
data security it should not rely solely

139
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,920
on I teach not fall soldiers charity has
a responsibility like everything else

140
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,029
that raised its head start

141
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:09,560
like most things that like most
throughout the organization I T should

142
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:15,670
largely responsible for 48 bility

143
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,320
should be a check

144
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:41,610
nobody tell nobody would know if this is
any way I could have been yet another

145
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,220
scary

146
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,540
according to view that there certainly
are a number of banks through this list

147
00:16:49,540 --> 00:17:07,270
I can think of maybe another half
although its largest section has 10

148
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:15,119
coating on there around the only exist
they all they all have a certain

149
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:36,419
activities that help us achieve so I so
I see for example the process that's

150
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:47,490
good for thirty years that's about that
one is courtesy of our friends and I saw

151
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:58,620
deals with the alignment of ITV and
business and extremely important one of

152
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:08,429
the most so much like all of these
church people did not attend the 22 be

153
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,600
that prescriptive and you certainly
should attempt to replicate the entire

154
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:24,909
thing rugged wooded section but even
those have they don't always keep pace

155
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,910
with new development

156
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:36,620
e 5542 still in draft for how the
address things like actual development

157
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:43,469
versus the old school waterfall sake not
an application security at a landing

158
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,470
when ready leaving my

159
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:58,760
so this this model is built with similar
process of releasing mine but to go just

160
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,930
deeper and is truly one of my pet peeves
that that stripper shoes we have such a

161
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:10,810
gap in available resources to tell us
how to do think it's it's it's mine by

162
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:28,659
attempting to get into a much like these
that are part of it it is so it's not a

163
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:34,830
sliding scale of one to five it is not
doing really well you doing this is to

164
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:40,389
measure activities and also provide a
roadmap activities that can get you to

165
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:51,230
services around for a similar model
certainly was not listed anywhere you

166
00:19:51,230 --> 00:20:04,570
look familiar with everyone I still do
look very happy to see if I thought of

167
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:11,820
such a burden to prove to some small or
large the green environment

168
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:22,850
yeah but for the truck

169
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:50,139
let me ask the obvious question as
possible because what are so that and

170
00:20:50,139 --> 00:21:33,168
that is the first anyone so he went to
the room sleeping more like a very

171
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:50,950
interested in this webinar at the
National I will be will be going through

172
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,989
the entire model in its entirety who
seek some workshops as well as well as

173
00:21:55,989 --> 00:22:05,950
so it's later in the year one in the us-
days they see as much as I see it there

174
00:22:05,950 --> 00:23:24,309
and so I expect to see some integrating
the two would call it largely focused on

175
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:32,809
ITV s you know my focus leading security
I'm hoping that those two models June

176
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:39,158
get married and find some material
barrel now denied knowing that I'm over

177
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:41,339
the next few months

178
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:47,440
language project and need to make sure
you know that some of those gaps remain

179
00:23:47,440 --> 00:24:02,429
so he could best be described as he was
familiar with the CNMI model kinda picks

180
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:09,710
up where i delete so so where i dont
gives us rolling out actually processed

181
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:14,429
cheese and sugar prices are environment
CMMI tells us how to go about improving

182
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:20,409
those things over time and is probably
my perspective on how to even start

183
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:22,160
where

184
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:35,410
see how it really decide and maybe bring
down a program managers of things of

185
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,150
that sort

186
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,110
they should be concerned with the way
all those things happen if you went back

187
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:58,860
to her responsibilities but then this
holders actually bring you more mature

188
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:13,040
and you're asking so it's actually I've
never tried not to get any of the others

189
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,820
and now that i'm gonna spend some time
this weekend

190
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,610
mapping it to my own just to see where
some of the things overlap his records

191
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:30,729
say about one vs one and get to is that
I'm intentionally looking at activities

192
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:36,070
and I have them but it by business
functions and broken down by security

193
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:53,389
practices where is looking just to see
you see how it breaks down this is not

194
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:58,410
to be confused just information security
general all of their domain just dirty I

195
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:04,920
want to measure how well im texting data
and the activities of dr. Thursday's

196
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,970
loss treatments like you're starting out
with actually doctor telling you are

197
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:19,310
going to do you should be doing and
that's part of the reason why there was

198
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,610
a framework for here are the attendees
you may want to consider doing this is

199
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,439
by no means completely like all of the
bottles

200
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:48,200
just how before the absolutely other
artifacts of the model so so it is

201
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,070
available under the Creative Commons 40
shareShare light noncommercial so anyone

202
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,830
can use it make you whatever you want
with it

203
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,659
three year old versions of it other
vendors can do the same thing the

204
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:09,800
patient's up C C 400 not commercial is
that they have to credit the sorts so

205
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:18,840
there's an assessment worksheet and get
a snapshot of that number of questions

206
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:28,070
questions questions from the world she
highlights the eighties and basically

207
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:37,590
you choose where she is a document that
explains the entire model explains how

208
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:42,209
to use the worksheet from there you get
our facts you can assessment across the

209
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:48,380
entire organization you can break it
down by the different business units as

210
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:55,810
as we continue to adopt very much
attention you see fit into my past

211
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:00,889
research I want to be able to go out and
then computer actually cities across the

212
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,810
organization

213
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,230
vs outcomes we know what works

214
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:15,070
indifferent but I don't know yet is how
well everything works and in what

215
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:21,850
environment and how does that say
different verticals there so we wanted

216
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:26,620
to start with framework that simply
address today to security and then so

217
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:38,409
this is a tricky things explained it so
it's so what is the actual this is going

218
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:50,370
to turn down with all the things you
mention so my policy management and my

219
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:56,899
documenting all the things that need to
her decision process that detainees who

220
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:05,960
have I explain to everyone what they are
responsible for any reviews guidelines

221
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:17,570
policies right nothing getting like that
but if that's being completed you

222
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:30,870
exceptional make sure that you're
writing policies not so hearing does not

223
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:42,649
in 2012 wires so those are the defining
the Standard Edition those are

224
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:48,929
securities those get close to getting
close to my controls and modeling didn't

225
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:50,520
read actors

226
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,520
any trademark

227
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:16,030
so that's actually need that but
certainly not actually that nation's

228
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:28,860
largest software because we were
fighting boundaries around things were

229
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,939
building and how we were going out we
were looking at the different attacks

230
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:47,910
that external penetration so it looks
like an external

231
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,410
they would start out doing would be
building today looking share with his

232
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:01,480
part of themselves should be told I
didn't often do so as part of my mic

233
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,720
reports largely because the reports were
going to see you folks that really want

234
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:15,790
that its threat they just went up
against your environment so we've been

235
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,129
doing pretty good standing

236
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:27,169
president software that threats against
it data is a whole new set of activities

237
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:34,240
that is based on the response here I
don't know we must keep it it's

238
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,049
important you should be doing it but
obviously you should be given that

239
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:44,510
activity across all things expansion
should be doing it costs you may not

240
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:48,980
have the resources to do all of it but
you started to perform the act the

241
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:55,740
exercise which is actually doing here so
I'm just not happy that we're really

242
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,510
excited and just looking at the
different ways

243
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:10,409
and what they value in getting to my
house and using that as a mechanism for

244
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:15,570
determining ready to face the
documentation again it's a little deeper

245
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:27,360
into you get to take this opportunity to
do little for my own my own selfish

246
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:34,039
purposes which actually find a workshop
on data only

247
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:59,450
that's ok because the model is designed
to end it doesn't say how did you do not

248
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:09,340
get its capability is not one that says
you are you attempting to use that she

249
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:23,100
explained to you with the resources are
the most about the activities will not

250
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:32,889
doing what we truly validation internal
audit not a bad River it's a very

251
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:38,110
necessary so are we doing many of the
things that we said we were doing and I

252
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:45,240
we didn't are we doing those things just
across to people but process goes to

253
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:52,090
show you that again that should live
with security operation those are the

254
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:56,590
things they should be looking at my
musical tastes are importing the

255
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,590
following up what you doing any of those
right now

256
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:11,110
mom has built in that most of us support
for me to some degree it was all about

257
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:28,830
hang it all together to understand
martina Security Act and he looks like

258
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,380
visualize my god

259
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:56,090
from street be there are there are four
levels of activities ranging from not

260
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:14,180
reactive to proactive and reactive the
process all stakeholders in the reactors

261
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:32,850
you are ready to match your so you know
the things that you have to do is you've

262
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:37,100
been told you happen to them that
something special

263
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:54,390
means that you find those things and
make sure that those aligned with the

264
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:59,470
things that you have to be relatively

265
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:13,180
easier but also argue not sure you do
but if you're feeling in this part of

266
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:31,990
the majority of viewers not before you
leave home at least role in altering

267
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:38,259
perspective you would you be doing for
not having at least you have those

268
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:43,000
policies in place it would be more of a
few more about finding but it certainly

269
00:36:43,000 --> 00:37:02,180
wouldn't change gradually seven years so
finding but you don't have to worry

270
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:17,589
about the phone so that he's you see and
now we're going to check to make sure

271
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:28,380
that those things are understood
throughout the environment so always

272
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,890
means that we need to automate as much
of this issue as much as possible not

273
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:41,960
all this week at and not only should not
all of it is just money if that's what

274
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,990
we can do things for example of this
stage like have already gone insane I

275
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:54,220
know all of the fortune once a year I
have to go into my life my crit Learning

276
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,859
Management System LMS I have

277
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:02,359
global policies but probably not
familiar with that is as it pertains to

278
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:12,029
teach our policies but that doesn't
happen so becomes impossible to hold

279
00:38:12,029 --> 00:38:16,150
someone accountable for four minutes
committee that you never told me should

280
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,950
be there whenever they were doing we
don't need to use because they

281
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:35,078
mishandled says data however if I have a
security problem that I try to but they

282
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:40,619
need to understand that it's their job
to enforce those policies and I need to

283
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:46,849
verify that they understand and what
should check in and say we still got

284
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:51,329
that one understands how that happens
this would have to be another innovation

285
00:38:51,329 --> 00:39:00,119
you shoot part of one of your editor do
you understand that you have to be

286
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,680
enforcing this policy yes and that the
NFL operational tasks that you're only

287
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:19,879
going should always have it on those
days so that there's a series so she

288
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,880
will sell

289
00:39:41,290 --> 00:40:03,920
that were part of the project

290
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:30,670
nearly everyone would have read that one
so it is not one of those that should be

291
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:44,060
measured in every organization should
which ones that they feel the need to

292
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:56,590
get to that banks deja based on based on
this is this is a twelve-minute smokey

293
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:30,820
road that's the reaction I didn't but
the truth is most organizations are

294
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:38,290
doing something happens they go back and
try to understand and you try to map out

295
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,290
what happened how it happened what was
the threat

296
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:49,040
what was the threat against that they
were so we react

297
00:41:49,570 --> 00:42:05,780
posted those beach the model says you
should be doing that much to do it poses

298
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:35,550
a problem because it may be other or so
in this scenario the scenario we may

299
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:42,070
have gotten learned from our said we may
have done to learn from Mark LT it got

300
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:49,190
something else and told us is a possible
threat to our environment have a look at

301
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:52,860
what it's trying to get to try to get to
their white revenue that so on and so

302
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,180
forth so again to some degree murder
already performing some of that activity

303
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:02,899
we are evolving threat against it were
not for theirs is actual software they

304
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:11,300
basically that was largely for software

305
00:45:32,300 --> 00:46:08,080
they're the ones that that information
is being there manually saying this is a

306
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:14,009
diet and they have either some annual
mechanism for doing that they seem in a

307
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:20,190
note stay put it in the header or maybe
there is even a magical solution that

308
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:29,740
another show how many folks are an
absolute minimum there are those who

309
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,819
those critical functions of handing says
that they have such as the INH art

310
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:44,710
auction that are working that data to be
a number of these activities I expect

311
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:50,460
that something else is doing to some of
the models listed give folks a framework

312
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,650
for understanding where they should be
doing these things and what that face

313
00:47:33,630 --> 00:49:27,089
but I will say I was talking about the
process not a lot of which completely

314
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:30,240
difficult to understand how to do that

315
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,508
requirements for doing that pitfalls of
having

316
00:49:33,509 --> 00:49:44,569
just completed a hospital that had
created I was not out and then I suppose

317
00:49:44,569 --> 00:49:49,429
that particular have 120 but it's like
yes that's not gonna work I can have a

318
00:49:49,429 --> 00:50:12,309
basket but there is no you know it needs
to be exciting time those things to you

319
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:29,419
also great story needs right and so you
have to start doing that but I need to

320
00:50:29,419 --> 00:50:32,419
be sure right on the street

321
00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:54,469
matter how I get there as it posted on
Monday morning next to say that yes so

322
00:50:54,469 --> 00:51:15,839
there's anything I guess so yes we're
not sure what the folks who won the

323
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:28,709
fight because they want to not have my
way not at all whatever your most folks

324
00:51:28,709 --> 00:51:34,388
over everything and that's just about
all kinds of responses was responsible

325
00:51:34,389 --> 00:51:43,099
so what we didn't want to automate the
process of enforcing those who certainly

326
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:53,319
prestige is no reason to completely stop
for a first date you may sleep while you

327
00:51:53,320 --> 00:52:01,920
do this but you do need to force those
controls we do the same thing all the

328
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:10,850
other doing street will be processed the
scene was this yesterday we define what

329
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:17,509
are also used where we took our policies
his the prosecution team breaks down a

330
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:24,390
process and now we know how we want to
handle so that it won't back away slowly

331
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:33,879
tell all of the people involved and in
doing so based on that being your policy

332
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:41,820
and also doing so based on that as we
attempt to ensure that your dishes just

333
00:52:41,820 --> 00:53:16,630
just truly are the last night was based
on cost it really depends both scale so

334
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:24,810
having all those of you defined policy
based on the company needs

335
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:35,390
based on that as well as having folks
that responsible for the day-to-day

336
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:40,569
oversight created also mandated by David
Holmes are based on that process and

337
00:53:40,569 --> 00:53:52,089
help identify that to our security
officials to have placed around those

338
00:53:52,089 --> 00:54:00,339
data types based on policies now I know
I'm going to be able to have a document

339
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:09,119
is classified as having that information
on the outside of my CD I need you to

340
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:20,609
automatically go speech I know he's an
HIV should resign his employer share to

341
00:54:20,609 --> 00:55:32,839
solicit there too as I have no choice
this evening I never be another machine

342
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:34,380
I have to get

343
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:41,960
however that the case against you and
how that possibly should live to see

344
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:55,140
that all of my other flat no need
rewriting your database itself is

345
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:02,310
something that's old hat gather some
proprietary database connection to that

346
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:31,690
so it's quite the home got out in front
of the nation but I created in this is

347
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:46,080
Halloween special now what do I do that
to people around here it's completely

348
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,970
all grown up

349
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:50,689
attempting to apply a modern street
patrol to it is going to be difficult

350
00:56:50,690 --> 00:57:10,320
without right just our Madden start and
mass messaging solutions that the need

351
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:16,730
to protect access to and from treated
differently than i three seeded virus

352
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:22,690
right now we're I'm more concerned with
what has access to the information

353
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:30,830
versus how I'm going to put controls
right so now you should now playing with

354
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:35,210
all the other types of mass
decaffeination you really want to focus

355
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:35,800
on that

356
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:46,800
case you shield is this going to be the
latest hot stuff you're gonna happen she

357
00:57:46,800 --> 00:58:04,090
Nexus from something so twenty years so
what is access to show us all but I

358
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:19,750
would argue that with you do that in
that scenario is you when you're looking

359
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:25,190
at how you're actually getting a raise
at least now you can see why you today

360
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:31,070
but in these other environments his wish
sometimes these

361
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:40,720
that's all I can do is control access
programs which is drawn out process boys

362
00:58:40,720 --> 00:59:01,720
includes and that's all that really big
ass and she didn't they just pulled out

363
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:24,700
one little balls for the standing of its
website which at least one really didn't

364
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,609
see it in time
