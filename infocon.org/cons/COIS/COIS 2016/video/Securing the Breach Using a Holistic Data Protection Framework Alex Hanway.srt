1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
thank you thank you well we're a little
after after 150 sites that we get down

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,509
to business my name's Alex Han Wei Miami
product marketing manager at Gemalto am

3
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:16,500
responsible for our equipment portfolio
and as such I get the opportunity to

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,990
participate with customers on a wide
range of issues and so we're gonna talk

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,859
a little bit today about using a
holistic data-protection approach

6
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,280
primarily with encryption key management
to secure your sensitive data going to

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,860
talk about this basically through the
perspective the experiences we've had

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,170
become so before we get underway I'm
kinda curious I can get a show of hands

9
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:52,210
how many of you right now work with
encryption on a day-to-day basis one how

10
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,780
many of you would like to use encryption
on a day-to-day basis

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:06,000
got 2345 ok so this fantastic this helps
me understand what to focus on next 45

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,530
minutes so how to get started we're
going to find a just a brief history of

13
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:17,790
encryption through the agents Riverview
how enterprises are looking at

14
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,970
encryption right now perhaps this will
speak to you very much like to get your

15
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,869
feedback as well and then we'll delve a
little deeper into white encryption key

16
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:30,420
management best practices look like and
how you put all of that together to get

17
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:38,369
the framework that we will review at the
end so cryptography or at least the idea

18
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,479
of the simulating information through
through tricks goes back for millennia

19
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,369
and actually the first organized
approach that we see with this goes back

20
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,950
to the Spartans were there to take this
thing politically essentially it was a

21
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,680
long strip of leather that they would
wrap around a dowel of the specific

22
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,520
length and diameter and they were tapped
out their messages in the latter unwind

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,429
it all and then send the message off to
another battlefield commander or bank

24
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,039
account for letting people know that one

25
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:15,349
to run for the health and this was a
reasonably effective approach for for

26
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:19,950
the time now is simple the person on the
other end needed a dowel of the same

27
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:27,488
diameter same lane to be able to
preschool message to Dan reading this

28
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:33,780
approach evolved and the first real
organized approach her we see something

29
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,170
that we would consider encryption
actually started with the Romans and

30
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,899
Caesar cipher where you would have to
alphabet staggered so you would write

31
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,150
your message

32
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,250
longhand and then start to transpose the
characters against the second alphabet

33
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,840
so in this instance your DS would become
A's B's would become be irrational

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,680
become Steve you can send your message
job and secretly as long as the person

35
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,470
on the other end knew where in the
alphabet start they could work backwards

36
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,730
transpose the message back into their
tax so again you had this idea the

37
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,108
message and then to secret that the
algorithm the new piece of knowledge

38
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,709
that you had to keep safe today

39
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:20,919
reread that message meant for centuries
largely stayed longest active is

40
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,510
generally character-based it did become
more complex but as with everything

41
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:30,510
enter the 19th and early 20th century
and everything went mechanical things

42
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:36,649
started to get more complex and actually
in 1918 the germans painted this enigma

43
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,849
rotor started an invention a few years
earlier actually designed to secure

44
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:47,129
trade secrets and then turned into
military use during World War one and

45
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:53,239
then later on ww2 and effective leader
rotors within this machine all

46
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,540
correspondent to specific and like every
time you hit a letter certain late with

47
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,709
a separate letter would would pop up
menu right now not later transcribed

48
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:08,889
your your message and the new encrypted
taxes fended off on a telegram in the

49
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:12,280
person on the other end as long as they
had a matching rotor would be able to

50
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,160
decrypt message so

51
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:21,110
not unlike what Caesar cipher did but a
lot faster and it also presented the

52
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:26,770
opportunity to be far more random and so
I did everything in twentieth-century

53
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,599
innovations fed up and this lasted
through world war two actually when the

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,970
big sagas of ww2 was discovering the
ability to beat this machine understand

55
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,690
German movement the advent of the end of
world war two and the advent of the

56
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:51,350
postwar age we entered the information
age and become the digital encryption

57
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:57,640
moved from character-based debate base
and then we had a series of innovations

58
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,349
that went from 56 big keys to now

59
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:05,550
hundred and twenty eight and 256 cheese
or modes that I'm sure most of you are

60
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,020
familiar with today the reform ago I
want to start this way wasn't

61
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,890
necessarily just to give a history
lesson but to come back to this

62
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,360
fundamental idea that will revisit time
and again throughout the presentation

63
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,230
that the basis of the security is
actually quite simple

64
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:27,730
the idea of having your your information
that you're trying to secure and the

65
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:33,750
secret that you're need to protect to be
able to encrypt and decrypt that message

66
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:40,440
right so as complex as things will get
we return to the simple idea it keeps it

67
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,690
all into perspective and so today this
is no this is no secret forrester this

68
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,669
last year reported a 54 percent of
organizations are saying that they're

69
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,080
using encryption extensively within the
organization

70
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,750
the same report found that additional
20% were planning on implementing and

71
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:06,380
corruption within the next year so sound
like based on a show of hands that are

72
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,180
quite a few you fall in that 20% where
you're looking at encryption and

73
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,410
starting to dig into this little deeper
and for good reason I we all know the

74
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,330
numbers I'm not gonna beat you over the
head with all this but last year alone

75
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,390
seven hundred and seven million records
were

76
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,630
through security breach I here in the
united states there were nearly 1,300

77
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,479
breach incidents that conduct about
three and a half a day right and we all

78
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,120
know the stories there and use every day
this affects everyone whether or not

79
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,100
you're and governments the private
sector the local level of the federal

80
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,090
level

81
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:47,138
everyone's been dealing with with this
in some way shape before and it's

82
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:57,360
driving how this is only going to get to
be more relevant more complex and more

83
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,380
vital right so we all know the data is
growing by leaps and bounds the Internet

84
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:09,960
of Things is just going to blow this
wide-open IDC projects that by 2020 will

85
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,099
be producing 44 trillion gigabytes of
data every single year right and Sophie

86
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:20,840
think about this you know all the
concerns that you have her just going to

87
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,109
grow exponentially right storing the
stuff in your datacenter defenders are

88
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,440
going to get bigger they're gonna get
more complex the infrastructures be used

89
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,460
to collect this data are going to get
bigger and more complex so how do you

90
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:40,690
create security framework around that
when we're used to building walls that

91
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:47,780
are bigger and taller and longer with
tools that we used to do determine who

92
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,138
gets under or through over or around the
small things about this little

93
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,099
differently and it makes these simple
questions even more complex right so

94
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,860
where to encrypt your data will how do
you do that when stopped moving to the

95
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,110
cloud or being replicated three other
different sites reusing right how do you

96
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,990
manage all of that if you got 44
trillion gigabytes of data is corrupted

97
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,150
and that's a beast in and of itself and
how do you do this in a way to make

98
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,698
sense

99
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:20,729
collaboratively within your organization
so what we're seeing from customers and

100
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:26,680
this is backed up by by reports that
we're seeing at a

101
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,839
Gartner and Forrester result is that
most organizations are approaching the

102
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:41,500
security specifically encryption and a
very objective focused short-term

103
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,330
approach a very short time so it only
comes about you have a business unit has

104
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,330
a project because they realize they're
either not compliance for regulations

105
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:56,700
are changing com compliant someone in
their industry has suffered a security

106
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,399
breach or they themselves have suffered
a security breach and so the pressure to

107
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,930
get something done very quickly which is
not necessarily bad is totally

108
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,510
understandable I'm sure all of you face
pressures one way shape or another to do

109
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:14,620
something like this maybe think about an
organization that may have 1020 business

110
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,640
units all doing this thing start to get
a little more complicated and foremost

111
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,209
business units were finding the feedback
that we get that they start off down the

112
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:28,420
path building it himself that he could
DIY approach because that works on most

113
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,349
of their projects right why would you go
to a third party vendor by something and

114
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,339
then she turned it into your
infrastructure when you have the skills

115
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:38,940
and talent to be able to do yourself

116
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,230
the issue that thing that we've been
finding why people have actually come to

117
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,870
talk to us is that encryption one is
generally more complex than people start

118
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,720
out thinking it is right building it
into your applications is not

119
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,839
necessarily a straightforward approach
and to once you actually building there

120
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:05,750
becomes a whole administrative effort
that goes on after to see you complete

121
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,830
the project

122
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,910
you achieve security or certain level of
compliance but then you have to maintain

123
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:17,689
that infrastructure you have to rotate
the keys you have to report on the lodge

124
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:22,279
he had to do the audit and that in and
of itself becomes a beast that no one

125
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:27,970
really planned on at the outset and so

126
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,680
the idea though the reason I prevent
this isn't necessarily to take critique

127
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,280
that the way things are going are wrong

128
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,230
is very normal and natural and people
are responding to the stimuli in the

129
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,750
pressures that are being asked of him
but when we take a step back at the

130
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:55,220
macro level this leads us down to an end
point that is is more complex and really

131
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,930
grinds to a halt in operations within
your organization so I wanna walk

132
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:06,719
through how do we actually get to that
point the road to hell is paved with

133
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,000
good intentions will what are those
great intentions no-decision start here

134
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,780
effectively this is the calculus that we
find our customers are running through

135
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:22,939
the right so year you got your data flow
you know where it originates where it

136
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,290
ends up and then you have a certain idea
of security versus the amount of

137
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,630
resources you're willing to dedicate
generating that security and somewhere

138
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,030
in there you figure out where the flow
you're going to establish your option

139
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,800
right so straightforward easy enough
well as you start thinking about the

140
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,290
fact that you can use encryption for a
lot of different reasons so you'll have

141
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,670
one business unit that's focusing on
complains you'll have another whose

142
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,990
driver is moving their workloads to the
cloud

143
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,550
you'll have a third that's focusing on
consolidating the data center and then

144
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,199
another one that's where to buy internet
think the responsible for all of the

145
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,290
data that's coming from their stances

146
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,140
totally normal everyone's operating in
their own best interest trying to move

147
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,160
the project forward but it when you
think about all of the different use

148
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,430
cases it becomes very clear how many
encryption keys are out there how many

149
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,209
you need to store and how many need to
manage and all of a sudden you've got an

150
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:25,070
organization with 10 business units all
implementing encryption you've also got

151
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,200
10 units managing their own encryptions

152
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,530
and that starts to get numbers and so
you start finding slightly so you've got

153
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,120
people worried about you back at media
with encryption file servers with

154
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,970
encryption you've got all of these
business units with their own encryption

155
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,720
and that becomes costly and the
administration becomes complex it

156
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,560
becomes a security issue because you
can't guarantee that policies are being

157
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,069
managed evenly across all right what
happens if a chart encryption and

158
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,930
they're doing everything perfectly and
financial asset in need some

159
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,400
informations so somehow you get
financing a charge to start working

160
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,720
together and a chart pattern that
featured information to finance where

161
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,240
the person responsible for security
there is on the beach drinking a pina

162
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,480
colada everyday right how do you how do
you ensure that data stays secure as it

163
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,760
stays within your organization right all
threads are necessarily external to the

164
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,650
organization you eliminate the ability
of repeatable process if everyone's

165
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,400
reinventing the wheel that slows down
the runnings of the organization and not

166
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,260
to mention the fact that they're just
challenges when you have 10 different

167
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:45,870
parts of the company so this is where we
pitch an idea right and idea for best

168
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,230
practice and that's to understand that
there is a relationship between

169
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,790
encryption there is a relationship
between key management but even though

170
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,719
there's that relationship we need to
separate the two start my first

171
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,880
attaching security to the data by using
encryption tokenization so you know that

172
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,270
once that data security is always secure
right so if you see cheerier information

173
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,750
at the application level as it enters
your databases as it enters into files

174
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,780
as those files are then backed up and
moved offsite you know that for its

175
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,980
entire life cycle it safe

176
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:27,920
right it's safe as long as the Caesars
right so you start taking this cheese

177
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,910
and you implement secure and property
management strategies and make vote the

178
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,240
administration of those two things
separate but two separate individuals

179
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:47,579
then you're creating a fail-safe
redundancy that protects the other so we

180
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:53,599
like this a decoupled your keys from
your so it's natural it's pretty into it

181
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,529
if there's a three-step approach first
figure out where your day right what's

182
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:03,470
the weirdest shit reside what's the flow
from the point is created what are the

183
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,290
touch point where does it end up what
are you trying to achieve once you

184
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,399
understand that the solution the type of
encryption that you need is relatively

185
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,790
straightforward once you do that
implement a property management strategy

186
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,149
will get into the best practices of
command ransacking centralized archie

187
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:25,970
management that only one person or group
be responsible for it

188
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:34,389
access to your key as separate do decent
no single individual has control of both

189
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:41,970
data and key management hiring again
something we'll get back to us so you've

190
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,910
decided to go with encryption you are
trying to figure out how to manage your

191
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:53,660
cheese you've got a couple off so first
for agile organizations who have a lot

192
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,199
of flexibility you need to spin out then
down pretty quickly there are certain

193
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:03,180
things such as doctor based managers and
there are number of vendors the dude

194
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,010
that do this I don't want anyone to feel
like this is a multi-page we've got

195
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,769
competitors that do this as well and the
idea that virtual machine running on a

196
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:16,040
server somewhere so if you're benefiting
from the cloud workloads you can spend

197
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:23,219
these up an Amazon or a sure goal or IBM
to give you all the functions that you

198
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,220
need to property manager teased so
functions call keys generate keys wrote

199
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:34,720
E Cheese delete keys the benefit really
comes into flexibility and within a

200
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,339
virtual machine the downside is that you
generally will not be able to offload

201
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,439
the same extent of cryptographic
operations on to a virtual machine as

202
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:48,990
you would a political planes the upside
however is that users are cheaper to

203
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,339
give you more flexibility and you can
use them in tandem with hardware

204
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:57,140
security modules also rooted in the
cloud to give you the same storage and

205
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,130
root of trust that you would get on
promised meaning you can still guarantee

206
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,140
that your teeth are locked away and it's
not just a random software files located

207
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:13,980
somewhere on the software on a service
that's second option is a physical

208
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,480
appliance that you attached by a network
benefit to go into this approach

209
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:28,040
generally better performance you'll get
expanded no expanded range of the number

210
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,980
of keys are you can manage you'll get
better control also complained reasons

211
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,900
you may want to have the keys and
everything stored within your datacenter

212
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:44,200
we don't have to nestle for no doubt
that cloud and benefit from better load

213
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:52,570
balancing and high availability so these
are the options you can mix and match

214
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,980
depending on the level of security need
if you need something that's fully

215
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,400
tamper-proof UK the play on prime
minister and a network-attached key

216
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,610
manager if you were OK with your team
and your not being tamper-proof but

217
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,149
you're still want to root your keys and
hardware you can still see him out of

218
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:14,830
the cloud using a virtual machine so the
best practices writes the encryption is

219
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:20,939
the easy part it's the key management
start to get complicated the first and

220
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,220
foremost most important thing you should
do is get up to speed and comfortable

221
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,419
with property managers and this will
change by my industry

222
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,650
some extent certain regulations will
dictate how often you need to rotate

223
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:44,180
your keys how do you delete data from Dr
that you're going to retire so get

224
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:50,510
comfortable and up to speed with how
regulations affect key management in

225
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:56,200
your industry and put one person on this
at the very least one person generally

226
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,200
more rotate your cheese

227
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,160
the ideas that you don't just encrypt
data and put it away that's part of it

228
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,990
but you want to keep people on their
toes right you want to change the

229
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,830
encryption so what's so someone can copy
that gate in and try to brute force

230
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,899
overtime

231
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,470
trashing the goalpost movie the second

232
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,100
centralization for all of your season
one place so we returned back to that

233
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:28,480
idea of the ten business units all with
their own set of encryption you got ten

234
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,090
different people managing keys how do
you at the macro level and CIO level

235
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:46,370
guaranteed control across this
organization you can but you don't have

236
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:53,449
to so depends depends on how you want to
do it there are certain ways to to

237
00:19:53,450 --> 00:20:00,810
rotate he's just by altering the header
header on on the data or on the key

238
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,070
itself or you can decrypt entry
encrypted so it comes down to the level

239
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,220
of security you want but most key
managers will give you the flexibility

240
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:17,420
and more stricter organizations well
will completely

241
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:23,500
encrypt and there are ways to do that
without decrypting itself most

242
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,770
organizations will will do I shall we
call it shallow key rotation

243
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:39,720
and they do that by by affecting better
question though many others before so

244
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:47,370
centralized her to end this is a return
to this and the second this really is

245
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,918
where you get the biggest benefit for
both control and cost savings so imagine

246
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,299
how this ten business units all
implementing encryption all managing

247
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:59,460
their employees what happens if you were
to take the key management off their

248
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:06,360
plates and put it in one central service
matter how much time energy and money to

249
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,289
freeze up across the organization right
and imagine if you are the Administrator

250
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,400
what kind of headache that takes off
your place if all this and you've got

251
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,820
one place within the organization that's
responsible for encryption key

252
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,610
management that's their expertise and
that's their day-to-day tasks to rotate

253
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:28,020
these keys to delete keys do all that
because he rotation doesn't sound like a

254
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,870
lot of work but imagine if you are
responsible for data center that has a

255
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,110
thousand file servers that's not
including the databases that's not

256
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:42,469
including virtual machines are workloads
move to the cloud or applications using

257
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,250
encryption that's just a to file servers
that's not even including petitions

258
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,730
within within different servers within
your organization you had to rotate all

259
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:56,419
of those keys every six months almost
becomes a real nightmare right and

260
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:01,260
especially as we go back and think about
44 trillion gigabytes that we're gonna

261
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,360
produced annually in the next four years
that's you know that becomes a challenge

262
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,799
that becomes a lot of time there could
be better spent on other parts providing

263
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,650
value elsewhere

264
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:18,419
once you centralize your keys you can
implement access controls to the data

265
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:23,390
you can govern that a charge and access
subset of foul play

266
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:29,400
finance get setup file R&D get set of
files be you can do that both at the

267
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,370
data level but also from the key measure
controlling who has access to those you

268
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:39,280
can separate duty among administrators
so the person responsible for storage

269
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:44,940
will never see the data include tax and
the environment they manage your team

270
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,950
manager can control all of the
encryption me he'll never have access to

271
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:54,720
the storage right thing goes for the
database imagine how important this

272
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,119
becomes if you're moving your data into
the cloud right how do you guarantee the

273
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:05,109
person responsible for storage in the
cloud isn't going to get into your day

274
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,769
encryption and managing the keys and
controlling the keys your cell is a

275
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:17,479
great way to think about it the other
day and encryption key is a file and

276
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,849
that files on the server somewhere who's
to say that someone can come along and

277
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:26,168
copy it move it somewhere else without
you knowing it so take your keys and

278
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:30,559
store them in harder whether it's from a
virtual manager or from a

279
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,418
network-attached a plan to make sure
that you've got a chance them available

280
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:39,940
to store the key because it also helps
you demonstrate complains right if you

281
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,399
can guarantee that your data is
encrypted and you're the only person

282
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:47,758
that picky and you have the logs to
prove that you're the only person who

283
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,429
seemed like she then you can demonstrate
the you're controlling your data

284
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,159
wherever it is whether it's in the cloud

285
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,789
whether it's offsite backup whether or
not you've got a geographically

286
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:06,049
dispersed environment and then the last
few are basically make sure there's

287
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:11,229
never just one set of the key most key
managers come with high availability

288
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:14,529
configuration for you can replicate from
one to the other

289
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:18,710
securely so that he take one offline for
maintenance one goes down your

290
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:28,309
maintaining access to today so if you do
this you move from the site leaders

291
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:34,158
central I sir this is starting to catch
on

292
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:43,090
gardener is projecting that centralized
management is going to be the root

293
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:47,980
encryption within the next few years and
that everything's going to build on that

294
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:55,740
and this will will significantly alter
the the way that your organization will

295
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,440
will work together for a number of
reasons one this approach helps you get

296
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,850
to better secured for the simple fact
never bring everything together and

297
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,850
putting one team in controlling your
eliminating

298
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:14,580
ensuring that instead of having nine of
your 10 business units doing encryption

299
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:19,169
appropriately you've got one
organization that's doing encryption

300
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,720
appropriately data security
appropriately for everyone this saves

301
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,820
money so if we come back and think about
key management 10 times versus chain

302
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:34,460
management ones I mean think of all of
the time money and effort that you're

303
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,460
saving

304
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:49,040
I got a case study at the end and the
case study at the end they did it under

305
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,920
information government governance but we
do have a couple customers off the top

306
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,030
of my head I know are doing it with a
ninety so I think it comes down to the

307
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:06,879
politics of the organization or just how
you want to do strategically and think

308
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,630
all of us have enough experience where
some organizations I T lead security

309
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:18,280
another is it legal to carry so I think
it comes down by we've seen boat that's

310
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:28,270
great question so consolidate commandant
will save money both by saving time and

311
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:33,310
effort but also think about it i mean
how many vendors that you work with

312
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,830
readers a volume discount

313
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,580
clothes and you're buying encryption
licenses once for the entire

314
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,199
organization you're also getting a
discount so from a macro level when

315
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:48,870
you're making the case to the c-suite
not only is this edition for you this is

316
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:54,889
good for the organization and this
relieves budget everywhere it improves

317
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,890
collaboration so going back to the
example of a char and finance if

318
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:03,059
everyone's on the same encryption
platform the barriers to working

319
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:09,230
together to share information is less
right now those barriers were smaller

320
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:13,070
you might have to work through the
central encryption service though people

321
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:19,418
had free access to cross functional data
but ultimately you're not getting the

322
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:23,620
silos that are keeping people from
collaborating not only does this lead to

323
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,850
faster innovation but the fact that
you're centralizing these services and

324
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:33,908
creating repeatable process he's also
drive innovation faster to get you to

325
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:38,120
value faster imagine if you're the
business unit and your need to

326
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,649
incorporate encryption into your
application that central service can

327
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:46,949
have sample code they can have the
encryption libraries already said they

328
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,139
can have a TI is there for you to call
and so instead of building this from the

329
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:55,279
ground up which is our natural
tendencies based on so many years of

330
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,740
success this approach actually takes
weeks or months off of your home your

331
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:07,710
cycles and gets you to value passed so
what this looks like the holistic data

332
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:12,230
protection frameworks starts with your
enterprise key measure sorry that it is

333
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,279
low cut off I started your teenager
that's the root of it all everything

334
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:21,429
else plugs once you do that you know
there are a number of vendors out there

335
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:25,220
is not just our portfolio you can find a
portfolio that works for you where the

336
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,299
solutions are the application the
database the file level

337
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:34,440
virtual machines tokenization it's all
there for you they all plug into the

338
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:41,100
same diamond ring once you do that
you've got protection for a broad set of

339
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,519
n points within your organization
whether its sequel database and no

340
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:50,379
sequel database had do these portfolios
will work together to cover this gas and

341
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:55,939
that's just from a single vendor then
from that portfolio most vendors with

342
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,350
their team manager also have a broad
ecosystem they build on top of that even

343
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:05,428
more so the idea is that there's no
single vendor that's going to solve all

344
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:08,889
of your problems and create world peace
but these vendors are working together

345
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:16,840
in a way that that lend their expertise
to cover gaps and to do so in a way that

346
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,389
lets you manage them all from one so
this is really that the trend that we're

347
00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:26,678
seeing where things are going whether is
Gemalto Andover metric analysis but

348
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:32,639
their their acquisition or merger is
going down the status while so for you

349
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:39,100
as ninety professional you have actually
a lot more power and leverage when

350
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,230
you're going to these vendors looking
for encryption to say I have these

351
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:47,440
solutions in my environment how are you
going to help me centralized them in

352
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,409
this teenager that better for you in the
long term is better for the vendor in

353
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:57,379
the long term and just makes things
easier right i mean if you've got to do

354
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:04,330
if you've got mainframes you know moving
from legacy to new workloads to the

355
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:09,480
cloud databases in both places no single
vendor is going to do all that in and of

356
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:17,200
themselves but you start bringing in
court works and I aww us to do all of

357
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,359
this stuff behind a single key manager
that just makes things easier for you so

358
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:29,830
come back to the customer success story
took the name off

359
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:36,549
but we have a large payment processor
that came to us about a year and a half

360
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:39,168
ago they're coming run into problems

361
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:43,460
precisely because of the silo parts of
their organization weren't working

362
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,640
effectively together and corruption was
the root of the problem they got over

363
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:53,399
two billion credit and payment cards
around the world so PCI DSS was

364
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:58,239
significant challenge and they needed us
to secure both structure and

365
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,799
unstructured we worked with that come up
with this idea of centralizing key

366
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,240
management and then for me got
encryption we call it encryption as I T

367
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:17,190
service and started work amazingly they
were excited by the fact that I love for

368
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,769
coming down and certain business units
Rick just working together they were

369
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:27,590
starting to create products that they
were then turning around and monetize it

370
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:33,408
wasn't just an internal internal
efficiency actually helped drive their

371
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:39,409
business and now I mean we we talked
with them often defined increased

372
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:44,720
efficiencies we are part of our our
Customer Advisory Council D help us

373
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,230
understand how the business units are
responding to this in all came back to

374
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:54,440
the idea that the the silos within the
organization there was such expertise

375
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,279
and timelines are so short

376
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:00,000
building in themselves just meet but now
they're taking a step back they're

377
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,370
finding all of the benefits all the
benefits I just shared are actually two

378
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:11,649
things that they reported so you know
from at a high level thought perspective

379
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:16,120
there's a lot this intuitive here but we
actually arrived at this point because

380
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:24,110
this discreet challenge and the outcomes
that this payment processor found by

381
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:29,399
implementing a centralized service so I
would like to tie a tie it back up

382
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:37,389
we talk about encryption and the
inevitability of security breaches quite

383
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:42,730
often I think it's certainly important
to acknowledge that this trip was part

384
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,110
of a larger security scope right
everyone should have a perimeter

385
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:51,590
everyone should have intrusion detection
no one should rely on August single

386
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:56,850
approach to security but there are
certain fundamental things that have

387
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:02,709
worked for thousands of years and
there's a reason why those approaches

388
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:07,840
just propagated involved in got better
right they went from strip of leather to

389
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,530
now

390
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,610
digital bits and bytes but the
fundamentals are the same if you do

391
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:16,439
those are you're going to be successful
and they're going to help you gonna fill

392
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,120
those gaps so you know

393
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,489
think about securing your data through
encryption keeping that secret the

394
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,580
encryption key private locking it away
and she do that your data can travel

395
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,530
anywhere

396
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:36,050
99.999 99 99 percent of the time I'll
stay secure so I'm that I think you very

397
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:41,059
much for showing up around if anyone has
questions and I hope you have enjoyed

398
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:42,090
your show
