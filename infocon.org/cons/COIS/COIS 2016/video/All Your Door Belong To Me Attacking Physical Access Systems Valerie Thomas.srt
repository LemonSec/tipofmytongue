1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
physical access systems today instead so
sorry this is your out exit stage left

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,240
over there that's fine I won't take it
personal

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:20,509
ok so really quick since I've hijack
this entire session will talk a little

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,570
bit about me is that you know who I am
so when I'm sorry for those of you who

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:31,480
don't know me originally from this area
so I know a lot of former coworkers an

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,030
associate's here so nice to be back in
town for a little so I'm an executive

7
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,649
consultant with a company called Sakura
Con some of you may have heard of us

8
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:46,890
Connie Matthews the leader of all great
things with this conference is one of

9
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,050
our sales representatives so if you
start seeing the logo a lot but I think

10
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,569
calling so we do a lot of cool things at
Sakura Con as a whole

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,899
into thirds so we have commercial sector
where I were you know we've got federal

12
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,740
space and those guys do a lot of
certification accreditation support

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,610
contracts

14
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,990
argumentation and knowing how the other
30 the company was just like the folks

15
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,460
that like work at certain places the
don't have windows I don't know who they

16
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:27,309
are but I think I've chosen the best of
the three so the commercial team we do a

17
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:33,200
whole lot of critical infrastructure
insurance banking little bit of

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,390
healthcare starting to blend in a little
more so I spend a lot of time and a lot

19
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,780
of different governments some waves
rippling through a substation other

20
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,409
words in the regular office building
over weeks it's something completely

21
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:54,290
different so we do a lot of the standard
network vulnerabilities us know

22
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,850
penetration testing and wireless and
stuff like that and that's all well and

23
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,280
good we also do a lot of

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:08,340
devices plus months or more of a little
medical and we really started kind of

25
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,819
finding your niche with physical access
a handful of years ago and there was

26
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,708
more out of client need

27
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:19,790
corporate bush so they're kind of
organically which is fantastic I have an

28
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,829
idea or chrome security background not a
physical security background so in a

29
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,270
little while will talk about why the
weather matters and the difference

30
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,720
between the two so I'm definitely what
you would call a physical access

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,380
enthusiasts not physical access
specialists everything that I've learned

32
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:46,410
has been on the job training school of
hard knocks and a lot of it as more of

33
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,180
just working with our clients and
figuring out you know what it is their

34
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,400
problems are whether they know it or not
so you're gonna see in this presentation

35
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,540
is more of the research and the
experience that we've gathered here at

36
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,989
Sakura Con by helping our clients and
doing our own physical access lab so a

37
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,769
lot of it you know I'm going to try to
put it on I D terms but some of it isn't

38
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:19,560
so I'll do my best to do some neutral
language so why the stock physical

39
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,170
access to kind of all over so I wanted
to put something together that really

40
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,280
count 0 pulls it all in so that we can
look at it as a whole and decide how we

41
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,690
should approach this is an industry will
talk about some of you know why its

42
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,859
unsecured

43
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:41,230
think some of the attack services and
then we'll put it all together so you

44
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,820
can see one of the attacks from its
inception all the way through completion

45
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:53,980
so physical access systems like what is
this exactly lot of different terms this

46
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,040
is the one that I've found is the most
accurate I'm not gonna read it to you

47
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,690
but really we're just trying to make
sure that were granting or denying

48
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,130
access to the appropriate folks so and I
D terms

49
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,840
firewall right we stop the people that
don't belong and will allow those who

50
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:21,120
have access through their everywhere so
once you start looking at those little

51
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,440
bit and you understand what to look for
and the components of these systems

52
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:31,350
you're gonna start seeing the pop up
everywhere from the dc-area so the

53
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:37,350
metric system the trains lot about going
on in their airports lot of a lot of

54
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,760
interesting stuff in airports schools
actually my daughter's elementary school

55
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:50,010
uses a fairly insufficient physical
access deployment and really want to

56
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,330
start to see them you'll start to be
able to pick out some other

57
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,030
vulnerabilities just by looking at the
equipment that's all the wall so that's

58
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:03,380
where we're trying to get today so what
are these components that I say so in

59
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:10,060
physical access world access control
point it's kind of the center of things

60
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,820
and that's really where we get to the
gate keeper more or less so they're

61
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:23,710
literally turns dial or parking gate or
some kind of door with various critical

62
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,349
reader so these little boxes are some of
them are very fancy some of them are not

63
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,200
the ones that you see in the photos here
is our moral legacy systems and we'll

64
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,240
talk a little bit about what that is
what that means but we have a credential

65
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,820
itself so when everything physical
access usually the first thing that

66
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,440
comes to mind is hard but there are a
lot of other different credentials that

67
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,810
can be used some of the like the gems
and small offices use the key tags same

68
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,030
technology just a different vehicle for
them

69
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:03,059
other technologies they don't really use
a credential at all sometimes they just

70
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,810
walk up to the bed and just put in a six
to eight digit code

71
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:12,130
and that is their culture I don't think
that's a good potential but that is

72
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,840
their credentials on the less and then
it got some biometric stuff thrown in

73
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,789
there as well

74
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:24,030
like that you don't have any i did not
bring my clear ones with me today

75
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,388
normally I bring on the scene gonna see
what's inside so they do have small

76
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:35,710
chips inside so these cards are not the
same as the chip and pin credit cards so

77
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,870
the stuff that we're going to learn
today does not apply for credit card

78
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,550
technology will not happen anybody's
credit card that's a different section

79
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,389
this one is solely for the purpose of
physical axis so they have small ships

80
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,320
in here and depending on the technology
sometimes there are one and sometimes

81
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,760
there are two the low frequency is
really what you're going to see out

82
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,099
there most of the time we call it legacy
but really it's eighty percent of the

83
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:11,440
market now so low frequency what does
that mean to us exactly because the data

84
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,039
moves so slow we can't put a whole lot
of data on there which means that we can

85
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:20,250
put a whole lot of features into that
system the higher frequency cards

86
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,130
started to gain popularity over the past
few years and they have some new

87
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,669
features that you can load onto that so
you know thirty four five six megahertz

88
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:33,340
as a lot faster than a hundred and
twenty-five killer and that matters

89
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,039
because that changes the amount of data
that we can send the rate that we can

90
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:43,469
send it so just like on the network side
when latency you this very important to

91
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,030
us

92
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:49,770
latency on a physical access is down
almost catastrophic it's unacceptable

93
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,590
and you'll see in some of the designs
why so well it doesn't seem like very

94
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,549
long you would have to wait for the time
you present your credential and it beeps

95
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:05,250
when it makes its decision you're
talking a couple of seconds but if you

96
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,430
start to add more things like encryption

97
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,170
and personal identifiers on top of the
stuff of surgery on that legacy card

98
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,510
it's gonna start taking longer and when
you have large environments like some of

99
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,909
the office buildings around here
downtown and you have to move thousands

100
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,610
of people in and out that's going to
start up your to you really quickly so

101
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,840
that's one of the challenges with
physical access is you have to move a

102
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,559
very large amount of people in a very
efficient way so the high-frequency

103
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,229
Carter really good for that purpose

104
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:40,090
you can encrypt them to some point and
you can put a whole lot of other stuff

105
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:46,080
on there that really helps put some
multi-factor into the access all beyond

106
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,750
all be all but it's a step in the right
direction so we look at this from the

107
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,190
wave when perspective and it kind of
makes a little bit more sense when you

108
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,650
look at it this way so if you look at
the top there that that's our low

109
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:05,449
frequency that Turkey tailor our legacy
card and are our number here is 34 28

110
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:12,600
1904 silicones 12 so you can see how it
rides the waves there how it since the

111
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,230
silicon first and then it's card number
of facility code is going to be usually

112
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,120
the same or the organization as a whole
and on the card number is what makes you

113
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,620
you makes you unique but when you send a
very slowly again you don't really have

114
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,340
a lot of room for multiple layers or
even multi-factor authentication because

115
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:39,110
it just takes too long but if you look
at the bottom with our high frequency

116
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,670
you know we have a lot more options
there we sent but same amount of data

117
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:52,510
just a very very short amount of time so
the way that the court is encoded kind

118
00:09:52,510 --> 00:10:01,270
of areas by bender and because we're
moreover we will automatically think

119
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,250
that things are just for security but in
the physical access we're gonna see the

120
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:12,220
how the the numbers are different on the
card and it's called that formatting

121
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,790
strings they're usually unique to each
vendor not because of security but so

122
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,270
the

123
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:24,329
vendor can lock you into only purchasing
cards and he falls from them so its

124
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:29,830
security by obscurity which we all know
never ends well but it's really just so

125
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,290
that they can they can log you in and
saw you more things to all those little

126
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:40,060
bits and bytes trouble along the wire to
what we call an access control panel and

127
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,270
its small on board computer not very big
but it's really kind of our our

128
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:54,280
gatekeeper in this it gets its
information access control server client

129
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,610
server kinda like I T

130
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:02,750
access control server is really really
the brain there and it usually has an

131
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,180
associated database sometimes on the
same machine because it's not really set

132
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,079
up by a 90% is usually set up by a
contractor who may not know that that's

133
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,820
a bad thing to do and that's basically
how when you see your security folks in

134
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,680
their clicking around and adding new
people to the system and uploading

135
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,849
pictures they're using the access
control software that's on the server

136
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:30,300
and that's really where everybody's
identity within the system lives so the

137
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,579
basic way that this were as you roll up
to that reader there you present your

138
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,700
credential your card or keep whatever
that's going to be a little pipe there

139
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:45,260
this weekend but this is actually
cereals is right on the copper so this

140
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:51,810
is not tcp/ip the reader is literally
wired directly to controller via copper

141
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:59,079
and it sends its output literally 10 in
a very simple program called called

142
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,880
weekend the industry standard because
it's very interoperable also very

143
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,400
vulnerable which we're going to talk
about a few slides so in a sense that

144
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,970
data to the controller the controller is
really what's making that decision so on

145
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:19,760
the controller it's got a cash basically
database of the axis so if I present my

146
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,760
credential to this reader to a door that
I don't have access to

147
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,480
the readers gonna wear the controller of
the crow controllers going to say no

148
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,339
she's not on this list will flash red
and make that really rude be so it's our

149
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:38,930
gatekeeper and then you see the Ethernet
connection between it and the server but

150
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:44,779
that's not used very often so when you
present your card it's not calling all

151
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:48,810
the way back to the server to see if
your card is still valid in the system

152
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,810
it's only calling to the controller
which has that crashed and depending on

153
00:12:52,810 --> 00:13:00,180
their preference video update between
the controller in the server sometimes

154
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,540
that only happens once a night they
don't really like to do it in the middle

155
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,610
of the day because it's pushing a large
amount of data to the controller and the

156
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,140
controller again is not very
sophisticated computer just a very small

157
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:19,240
board so it can handle a lot of tropical
ones especially on the tcp/ip side so

158
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,089
you know if you are about somebody's
access and you don't instantly up to all

159
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:32,279
of your controllers hardest a little
work until the next think so basically

160
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:41,680
how it looks on its architecture their
cover most of the exit button we call

161
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,459
this a request to exit and some stores
have them and some don't and basically

162
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,109
what that is when you get close to the
door

163
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,480
sometimes it's a button sometimes it's a
motion detector that signals the door

164
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:01,150
contact their the top that magnet to
release so the door can open once you

165
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,150
start cheering these it gets a little
complicated

166
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,569
other controllers if you bought some of
the expansion boards they are only

167
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:15,660
talking maybe they can handle ten to
fifteen different doors so usually you

168
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,150
have a large cluster of these scattered
throughout the environment some

169
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,590
companies like to do the my floor

170
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:27,320
third floor has its own controller the
fourth floor has its own controller and

171
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,530
others it lumps together because there
are smaller environment and the wiring

172
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:37,010
to work so right so the other thing to
keep in mind these clusters are also

173
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:42,870
kind of limited on how far apart they
can be by the link of the copper wire to

174
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,760
connect the reader to the controller so
that there's a limit is about 500 feet

175
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,600
which is why you see so many of these
gathered in an environment that may not

176
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,020
be as physically large as you would
expect so even if it's a medium sized

177
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,730
building there may be multiple
controllers there just because of the

178
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,730
fact of how the wiring lines in the
closet

179
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,040
personality of security this is a
borrowed slide from my awesome boss

180
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:21,230
who's not gonna be mad that I borrowed
so we've got computer security folks and

181
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,350
we got physical security folks and we
protect the same stuff right at the end

182
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,540
of the day we're protecting what's in
the server room we're protecting the

183
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,699
data that resides there were protecting
the individuals in their information of

184
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,580
our customers and our employees but the
computer security folks gonna get on

185
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,050
their little pedestal because they're
really smart people have somebody tells

186
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:50,010
you they they have a job and physical
security you kind of get the I'm sure

187
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,950
you'll get a better job someday I'm sure
it'll get better it's ok and the

188
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,790
controls are mostly designed by an
electrical contractor kinda like it

189
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,490
seems I don't remember what the local
winners here most of the time they come

190
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:11,390
in there were the stuff up in the car
door opens are done so they don't really

191
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,459
look into things like architecture
network design

192
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:22,378
because they don't need to know that's
what personality really create the gap

193
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:27,569
between the two you not just technology
but between the two groups as a whole

194
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:32,990
and physical access systems are starting
to rely more and more on network

195
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:39,290
components and smart ideas and smart
devices but the folks that are

196
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,019
responsible for it on the physical side
don't really understand the technology

197
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:49,410
so all they know is the the computer
people suck it up and it works which is

198
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,009
a problem because the computer people
who set it up

199
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:57,649
may not necessarily understand physical
security and we see a lot of that a

200
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:04,349
prime example is just architecture in
general when it comes to not work a lot

201
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:08,039
of times will come into a client-side
I'm doing an internal vulnerability

202
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,449
assessment on them like we're not even
really looking at physical access but

203
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:16,419
I'll start to find or controllers on the
internet because they may have to cross

204
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:22,120
between both worlds right and they're
they're wide open to the entire network

205
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,869
so when we bring it up and the opry now
they'll get the physical security guy

206
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:32,668
and he comes down is no you know they're
they're on their own feeling well

207
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:36,710
they're on their own villain but that's
a routable vila anybody on the network

208
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,380
in touch that so the physical guys like
but they're on their own bill entitled

209
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,200
the network I need that then they go get
the network on the network guys like hey

210
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,340
you didn't say anything about a course
on that deal in you just said you need

211
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:55,470
to feel end and the physical guys like
water so us an information security

212
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,890
conoco neutral work to close that gap a
little bit systems don't get installed

213
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:09,260
or updated very often so your life span
for physical access is usually fifteen

214
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,980
years ten to fifteen the cost millions
and millions of dollars they're

215
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,980
difficult to approve it difficult to
install

216
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,440
it's not like watching a windows box it
takes a significant amount of time to

217
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,380
upgrade these devices so they don't
really get the same refresh cycle that

218
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,270
we're used to really get security
patches like we do you know we're used

219
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,970
to rolling updates and patches Tuesday
and all of that stuff and hotfixes but

220
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,620
once deployed in the physical access
we're all like that that's it it works

221
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,620
nobody touches so this creates a whole
lot of problems

222
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,600
culturally as well because when we start
to talk about changes that need to be

223
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,909
made the Nets will wait a minute we we
haven't changed anything we were not

224
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,870
going to change it we don't want to we
don't want to break so we really need to

225
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,049
get involved as information security
professionals kind of the process before

226
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:11,860
that starts and I'm working on some some
ways to do that the other problem with

227
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,020
the physical security industry as a
whole they rely on the technology of the

228
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:22,139
network but they don't understand it
they also don't understand things like

229
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,530
encryption so it is one of the largest
manufacturers of access control systems

230
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:33,290
in the world most your badges probably
have a an HID logo on the back of them

231
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:38,870
don't look now so they decided a while
back that they were going to get ahead

232
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,809
of the game and they were going to
encrypt their cards and it was going to

233
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:47,320
be revolutionary and they were going to
be able to sell a lot of its 140

234
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,668
compliance they can get on the GSA
register and all of that no be very

235
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:56,280
secure and they turned a whole lot of
money but they decided to roll their own

236
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,809
crypto instead of bringing in the folks
that I understand cryptography they just

237
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:03,678
use whatever the folks who worked there

238
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,910
thought was best not beat Robert hours
so I don't know of any story where

239
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,559
somebody has rolled their own
cryptography that ends well so if you

240
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,910
have one please tell me later because
I'm really interested in hearing it so

241
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:21,500
they signed all of these readers about
strip get on the reader to get on the

242
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,640
car rental and the Sun

243
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:32,980
but they signed it all with the same
private key everywhere when I T know

244
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:38,000
that's bad but they didn't know that was
bad they thought nobody will ever bother

245
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,950
and nobody will ever well somebody
extracted the private key from a reader

246
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:49,860
a handful years ago and published it
caused a lot of problems I cannot take

247
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:57,260
credit for the blood with permission
because it is also so so we have some

248
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:03,500
problems most of the organizations that
have already deployed these systems they

249
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,010
can't really read them certificates
cheaply the vendor would have to

250
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:14,750
literally come in and pull all of our
readers off of the wall and physically

251
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,560
alter the key that's on them and for a
small building that might be possible

252
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:24,429
but for larger organizations that have
campuses all over the country or all

253
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,310
over the world that's just really not
possible they're kind of stuck with it

254
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:33,780
upgrade and trying to put the
remediation in place to prevent that but

255
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,940
cloning for me

256
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:43,370
possible is pretty typical where to talk
about culture some very very vulnerable

257
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:48,639
but that's the thing that I think takes
the most understanding they they trust

258
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,600
their vendor a lot because they only
really deal with that better so in some

259
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,439
of the answers as we found some insecure
deployments some open web servers and

260
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,260
config tools and we recommended that
they disabled list features so when they

261
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,730
review it and the vendor comes in the
vendor says I can be disabled

262
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:16,879
can't be done so I look at the manual
party at them and would point to the

263
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:21,360
page where it says this is how do you
disable this web service if you're not

264
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,959
gonna disable it at least put a password
on the vendors we won't support it if

265
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,970
you change anything so then the kind of
other vendor believe them because

266
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,149
they're so reliant that they are afraid
to say no

267
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:41,730
talk a little bit attack services so I
know heart attacks get a lot of

268
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:47,580
attention and they're very useful I use
them alot and are red team activity but

269
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,649
there are a lot of other tax services
that are out there so we'll talk about

270
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:55,899
car at the little bit just to get a
quick overview of what they are and how

271
00:22:55,899 --> 00:23:00,590
it works and it's bad but we'll move on
to some of the other stuff that really

272
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,590
kind of ties the system as a whole

273
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:08,489
how many of you know the approximate 30

274
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:19,159
there are 23 is supposed to be a
research 2004 RFID analysis but you can

275
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:25,210
buy them have gone so can you draw your
own conclusions there it's very small

276
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,309
about the size of a solid state drive
but that doesn't have any power or

277
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:33,980
antennas with it so when we were using
those early on in the field during red

278
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,960
team's it was very like it's not
portable you gotta get a battery pack

279
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,429
for it you gotta get there and some of
the guys will put that in their pocket

280
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:48,169
and run those cables down their arm put
the internet on their hands when they

281
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:52,059
get close to somebody's car they can
just kind of put their hand up there be

282
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:57,999
as creepy but my arms are short and I
just could not make that work so I

283
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:04,570
started with a couple of different ideas
this is my RFID binder do the poor

284
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:10,230
binder will never be the same so went to
Staples very nice-looking binder go to

285
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,250
the inside

286
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:16,140
but some poker on here so I mounts the
proxy war and that little battery pack

287
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,280
up there is one of those little like
cell phone charging packs that there's

288
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:26,399
nothing fancy rather the cable over to
the other side so that it holds in the

289
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:35,030
other problem with those connections are
very very very sensitive so you can have

290
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,710
everything plugged in and you can get
your read and then you push the button

291
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:43,180
again to replay that data and it doesn't
replace so then you're standing there by

292
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:50,150
the card reader waving this bag and
nothing's happening so you can opt to go

293
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,480
with the flow so so that it really work
as well and it is something that would

294
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,910
hold everything in place but not I
didn't do anything so next came the

295
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:08,200
gridded Microcenter really designed for
like keeping all of your cables and all

296
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,080
of them a conductor's those Mac people
need regular operation but it was

297
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,300
fantastic for the property market hold
everything in place the cables not

298
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,220
really working around that much you're
gonna focus the Internet where it's more

299
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,580
convenient for you so with this we would
basically put it on a laptop sleeve so

300
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:34,129
unlike larger environments Chicago we
needed to try to steal somebody's card

301
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:40,100
contents on the street it was easier to
walk around and kind of swing by them

302
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:46,490
and kind of put that out really quick
read range on it is very small like this

303
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:50,440
trying to get that close to somebody's
car depending on where that's hanging is

304
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,100
extremely awkward I don't care if you're
female or not it's just weird so

305
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,600
recently they come up with something
better designs really gonna give us some

306
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,530
range so there's no more awkward
conversations on the train as I tried to

307
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,490
close to somebody

308
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,140
a woman I some long-range readers which
is really cool they've basically taken

309
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,410
readers that belong in parking garages
you have a larger read range because

310
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:23,530
there are larger reader and they have
some slides with us

311
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:27,410
ok so they weaponize these and basically
what they're doing is they're going to

312
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:31,710
read the weekend put on the back side
where we talked about the house on the

313
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:37,290
copper on the back sign so they just
made a big reader to do that with the

314
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:41,790
reader is really good consistent in feet
sometimes three depending on the

315
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:47,300
environment here an intelligent metal is
around and I want to store hundreds of

316
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:53,950
cards the products marked with you can
only store like to maybe before had to

317
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:59,809
to recycle and it's not at all so if it
lost power and everything so the long

318
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:03,660
range reader kinda really solved a lot
of those they're kind of expensive

319
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,790
though they're the reader itself can be
between four and five hundred dollars

320
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,010
the rest of the equipment is fairly
inexpensive

321
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:18,020
design one this was Bishop boxes
designed for example years ago he's got

322
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,460
all the stuff up on their website to
view multiple plans down have her on

323
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:27,740
board cut its really not that terribly
lengthy process I'm so he put a display

324
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,470
of paris auto shows you the card
information as well and it writes

325
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:37,080
everything to the microSD so instead of
trying to get so close to somebody that

326
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,610
I get card contents and then push
another run to play it later now I can

327
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,840
just walk around at lunch time in the
morning and then go back to my car the

328
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,030
hotel or wherever we are full of that
microSD and then just loaded up and look

329
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:55,090
at the card data that I have and then
you can kind of draw conclusions based

330
00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:00,010
on the facility care of the card numbers
that you're seeing the most of you know

331
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,010
this is probably for the building that I
was closest to at that time

332
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,320
picture what it looks like on the inside

333
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:13,210
those double A batteries do not last
very long at all so that was kind of one

334
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,020
of the big challenges with it was all in
all those batteries around and trying to

335
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:24,570
keep it and power that's what the text
files like very useful but it didn't

336
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:32,000
keep our for very long so I don't
remember the folks that deployed the car

337
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,550
driven had their stuff as I get home you
can pull down their code they use the

338
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:46,060
new york reno's and a lot of stuff so
you can go to Microcenter and get most

339
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:51,669
of what you need to make this device
instead of having to order it online and

340
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:58,480
it does the same basic operation except
it's much smaller and the little red

341
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,000
thing there is actually a Bluetooth
module seven out of money because I'm

342
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,860
lazy and haven't saw it all together the
Bluetooth module can sync with your

343
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:11,699
phone and you can put your phone on
vibrate so that you know when you're

344
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,770
getting card reader so as it gets harder
it will write it to the microSD and then

345
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:20,090
it'll send that data to your phone so
it's very useful for a couple of reasons

346
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,770
wanted time stamps because when you're
just walking around you know you kinda

347
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:28,889
got close to somebody but then you get
close to a whole bunch of somebody is so

348
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,080
close to the security guard about 1
o'clock really kinda want to focus on

349
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,240
those card reads to see if I got a good
one in that area that looks like it's

350
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,180
going to match the form out so the cards
house so the time stepping on that helps

351
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,360
having it be sent to your phone really
lets you know if it's working or not

352
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,260
otherwise you just walk around and hope
that it works and get back to your car

353
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:56,490
and realized the microSD popped out or
something and it wasn't working so it

354
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,630
saves a lot of fun

355
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,710
some of the other readers like this one
is a low frequency readers are there a

356
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,600
lot there's a lot of space in there some
of the high frequencies I can get a

357
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,990
night class reader or an insult

358
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:13,700
they don't have any space inside of them
for you to put your stuff so I basically

359
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:20,070
just took like a project box I think I
got a price and just kind of wanted that

360
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,710
in there so that I can just plug it into
whatever reader I need to use at that

361
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,800
time is not all of our clients is the
same technology will stop if you're

362
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,629
interested

363
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:37,380
page where you get the Bluetooth out on
you don't have to write it down I'm

364
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:44,140
gonna post power for this though I
cannot be noticed on the photo it uses a

365
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:50,480
different power source the power banks
have really come a long way so I don't

366
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,410
have to carry a whole bunch of batteries
with me anymore I just invested in the

367
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:59,809
nice power bank and has to have a 12
volt output of the only drawback but the

368
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:04,910
last several hours they were close to
six six seven hours which is more than

369
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:10,270
enough time for you to get what you need
so if you're going to want to make sure

370
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:14,400
it has a switch for 12 volt output and
you can let me know if you have

371
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:20,300
questions I have made a couple of the
different models now so remote attacks

372
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:29,040
technical very very impressive to
physical security kind of being behind

373
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:35,030
us with security through obscurity and
things like that on the back of your car

374
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:39,980
ads don't look now you can later most of
the time the card numbers printed on the

375
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:48,270
back of the card so you kind of take
some convincing to get them to

376
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:53,629
understand that this is an issue so I T
people come out there like all what's

377
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:57,330
the big deal and said okay well this is
the equivalent of taking a sharpie and

378
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:01,370
writing your password to your laptop on
your laptop and carrying it around

379
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,149
everywhere and never changing it because
you can't

380
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:09,320
because we only need those two pieces of
information to make our own cards so

381
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,649
Dakota the card number

382
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:15,430
walking around with you know card
numbers floating everywhere gives us a

383
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:22,800
really really big head start the other
problem is they also the box but the

384
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,270
cards come in but so there's some great
social engineering opportunities here

385
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,670
you want to call them up impersonating
their vendor to try to get the last

386
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:37,450
range of the car that they have tells
the card format the range that they have

387
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:44,120
the facility code who they ordered it
from any usually these like Instax the

388
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,929
IDS stations so you get the right person
on the phone you can get them to redo

389
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:51,850
that information and you don't even have
to go out and be creepy with bad reader

390
00:32:51,850 --> 00:33:00,050
very convenient for red teams won the
travel let's look at some of the reader

391
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,350
attacks this stuff is a little bit
different starting to gain more

392
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:11,110
popularity we're back to the weekend up
again on the backside the little bleak

393
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:17,310
he basically goes in line with those
wires so if you walk up to one of those

394
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:22,129
readers and you pull back from the wall
the copper wires are exposed unless

395
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:26,970
they're parted properly which I haven't
seen anybody who fully parts all of

396
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:31,710
their wires on their readers so you
basically just clip it to the three

397
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:38,880
wires there think its power ground and
died 21 and it's it's in line so it's

398
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,180
like man in the middle for a card reader
and its Bluetooth so it syncs to your

399
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:48,070
phone so as long as you're like close to
their reader it'll send you the card

400
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:53,649
data and you can send it commands from
your phone so if I watch somebody's card

401
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:58,620
and enter through the door I can just
tell it to replay that last card reader

402
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:04,550
data let me through the door without a
car so good stuff and it also saves

403
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:09,100
everything to microSD as well so if I
know if I can really hang out by that

404
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,879
reader without getting caught I can
install it leave it and come back or the

405
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:19,540
next day because it gets its power from
the reader is very small the guy who

406
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,639
made its Canadian which is why there's
the the Canadian coin to compare it to

407
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,230
but it's small and insoles very quickly
you can be in an hour and have it

408
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:34,270
installed in less than a minute so
readers only parting is very important

409
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:39,149
more information here I'm gonna put the
slides up to you guys grab them you

410
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:43,839
don't have to worry about writing down
all the links but wanna go a little bit

411
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:49,950
low-tech back to request exit devices
loser release of this decade and summer

412
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:55,388
not that little white box at the top
there is a motion detector so this means

413
00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:00,800
when you approach that door to leave it
will send you our motion and lock the

414
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,730
door so that you can push the door open
to leave without having to push a button

415
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:09,700
or having to scan your your credential
again to get the door to open their

416
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,580
convenience they're using a lot of
places but they're vulnerable to some

417
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:19,690
like really basic attacks so we look at
the story of these doors tell us a

418
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:24,890
couple of things one of which we can see
that it's a magnetic lock from those two

419
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,980
little buttons there at the top

420
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,340
those are the screws that are holding
the magnets that will hold the door and

421
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,980
that's what we need to get to release
because there's a lot of pressure on

422
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,580
those magnets you're not gonna force it
open there's also a very large gap

423
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:43,450
between those doors and underneath of
those doors so user really sophisticated

424
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:49,350
device to open the door from the outside
through that you can get it from the dry

425
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:53,250
cleaners I like to use this one because
as we love our customers

426
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,290
basically unfold it and you make
yourself a little flag and the flag

427
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,860
either between the doors are under
between us better as you can get closer

428
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:07,850
to you the motion sensor and use waiver
little flag around the motion sensor

429
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:13,049
senses motion so it unlocks the door so
they don't even really need cards or

430
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:19,110
Bluetooth outs or anything to get inside
of the door I hope my video where I

431
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,410
don't have time to test it so if you do
this properly it only takes a few

432
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:33,529
seconds like a few seconds so that's
very cool they've come up with a couple

433
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:38,170
of ways to combat the easiest way is to
just put some metals stripping between

434
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,430
the doors and underneath some places
choose not to do that for various

435
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:47,120
reasons so they adjust the Redeem so
that it's not so close to the doors that

436
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,000
it's further out which has its own
challenges a you know people that are

437
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,120
just walking around in the building in
that room can trip up motion sensor just

438
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,810
by not being close to the door because
the team is away from the door

439
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:09,000
second of which doesn't work but the
balloons will get the really big clown

440
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,640
balloons and its line between the door
if you have kids you probably have one

441
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,670
of those hand pumps for the balloons for
the kids birthday parties

442
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:22,800
portable but the blooming between it is
up to us just about ready to bust and

443
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,480
you let go of it the balloon goes like
this and then the motion sensor

444
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:34,500
fantastic very low Doug it's only
awkward when it doesn't work and you

445
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,550
tried a couple of times and then there's
a pile of balloons on the inside of the

446
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:41,780
door that you can't get too so that it
takes a little explaining the next day

447
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:51,180
sliding doors they're useful but they're
not always the best way to client that

448
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,069
was very proud of these doors that they
put into their

449
00:37:54,070 --> 00:38:01,640
redeployment data center and it was cool
card and then we'll automatically open

450
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,660
and then when they wanted to exit but
swipe the card it will automatically

451
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,190
close so that if they were pushing a
server Carter something they don't have

452
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:13,090
to worry about holding the door open and
trying to balance everything but because

453
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:20,170
the door has 240 flow freely for fire
code if there's fire you can just kinda

454
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:32,050
like yourself in without badge so future
for them to get to get something a

455
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,930
little bit better implemented and that's
where they can still meet their fire

456
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:40,220
code but not just walk up and blow the
door open if their system is configured

457
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:47,669
properly this would deploy an alarm on
the physical access system but its

458
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:53,890
network monitoring they get the hundreds
of alarms and most of the time nobody

459
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,850
pays attention so just because it sets
off an alarm does not mean that

460
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,910
somebody's actually going to acknowledge
the alarm and go see what's happening

461
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:08,680
control panels control battles are my
favorite because their disposal

462
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,660
computers as a little single boards
they're always forgotten but they're

463
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,770
really the brains of this entire
operation and they have a ton of useful

464
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:22,480
data remember it has to have all of the
access list cached on it because if it

465
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,520
loses connection to the server and can't
update for a while or if they have a

466
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,070
power outage that controller has a
battery backup intense you can still

467
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,500
open the doors and things and people can
get an A in and out of the building to

468
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,990
work on the power outage so it's gotta
keep all that data local and that's

469
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:43,810
great because we want that data red team
members we want that data so that we can

470
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:49,190
make all of our own cards they have a
really quite figured out that these

471
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,520
needed locked down yet from the
underside so until that happens we need

472
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,650
to compensate for that on the client
side a lot of them have a better web

473
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,560
servers that

474
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,210
go to them and it drops you into the
admin console or diagnostic utility

475
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:11,200
that's full of information that we can
use to make our own cards usually they r

476
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:18,169
on FTP anonymous FTP so they can send
their backup data back and forth a lot

477
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:23,970
of public-private as an empty strings of
these devices so once you start likes

478
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:27,939
gang some of the the internal networks
you might start to see them pop up but

479
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,100
unless you know really what you're
looking at it doesn't make a lot of

480
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:39,970
sense they're very fragile though so
when you do find them do not do a 65 K

481
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:44,899
parts Ken because they don't handle that
very well it doesn't even I don't even

482
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:50,060
think about the full tcp/ip stack so it
does some basic stuff but it cannot

483
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:54,830
handle a heavy load and a lot of times
these devices will be excluded if the

484
00:40:54,830 --> 00:41:00,140
company does like monthly vulnerability
scans because it causes problems so then

485
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,270
they're even forgotten even more because
they're not included in the monthly

486
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:08,390
scanning a lot of those web diagnostic
utilities only work with Internet

487
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:12,710
Explorer so if you're using Firefox or
something else like I usually am and you

488
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,940
hit one of these web servers you know
it's there but you don't see anything

489
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,960
before it over to you you know your
windows or whatever in check it out and

490
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:26,750
Internet Explorer switching the agent of
your labor for something doesn't doesn't

491
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:32,270
work so this is the most common port
numbers that I C and some of the key

492
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,820
words so if you're just reviewing
someone else's vulnerability scans like

493
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:40,220
their monthly scans it's easier to find
some of the key words and some of the

494
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:45,480
informational finding like the ethernet
card manufacture a lot of times you'll

495
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,210
see tyco in there which is one of the
big manufacturers matrix I Starlin oh

496
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:59,910
really good keywords for ACOs control
panels what can I tell us a whole lot of

497
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,710
stuff because it has everything cash
surety we just have to figure out how to

498
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,950
get to it they're very chatty kind of
children

499
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:13,140
once you get access to one because says
hey i'm bobbi and here's all of my

500
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:18,819
friends and how to find them so it'll
tell you all about its path to the data

501
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:24,270
boosted it talks to tell you about
clustering information on the master

502
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:29,720
controller and these are all of the
controllers that report to me so if for

503
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,459
some reason some kind of configuration
gets changed the call to that master

504
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:38,330
controller instead of all the way back
so we can really if we wanted to cause

505
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:43,299
damage you can really start to poison
that cash by putting in a relevant data

506
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:48,670
and letting it propagates well I don't
want to do that because I want to open

507
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:55,120
doors want to block everything out some
of the databases you can literally just

508
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:01,740
click on browse which is very useful for
the personnel lady and the card number

509
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,629
and the group of a belong to the access
control system in all the stuff that

510
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,000
they've touched its literally just a
full log for a couple of reasons your

511
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,670
forensic reasons 150 reasons for another
are supposed to be able to account for

512
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:20,870
the people that are in the building at
the time so it'll just tell you all of

513
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,870
this if you can do it with a browser
kind of a problem

514
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,570
verdicts as a tool that goes out and
actually hunt a specific brand new used

515
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:35,080
or controllers I don't see a lot of a
trade used or controllers and large

516
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:40,500
enterprise environments are usually see
them in smaller ones I know we're

517
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,540
running behind Sergas ok the servers
themselves these guys are kinda hard to

518
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:50,590
find because they're usually just like a
Windows 2012 server that's just you know

519
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:57,020
included in that server block sometimes
there are named for both software they

520
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:01,430
use so if I wanna finances control
server sometimes I can just look up

521
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,890
procedure 9000

522
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:07,839
or packs or physical access because
that's what they know they named their

523
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,190
server so we're gonna be careful with
how we do

524
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:18,959
keywords and DNS name in with some of
these servers keywords here for you but

525
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,549
the slides up seen grabbing later

526
00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:24,309
sometimes we can find them without
actually having to hit the internal

527
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:29,440
network so showdown will also index a
lot of physical access system interfaces

528
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,539
so a lot of these keywords that I gave
you you can kind of search show down to

529
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:39,930
just to see what's out there a lot of
other places that we can find so what

530
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:45,808
numbers and facility are on the internal
network with SharePoint usually they

531
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:50,740
have almost like a remedy ticketing
system where they keep their logo

532
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,979
you know I destroyed badge number
whatever and I reissued this person so I

533
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,299
may not even need to gain access to the
actual physical access server to get

534
00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:08,059
valid card numbers ok almost done a
little bit over so in a recent

535
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:15,809
engagement we had a client that was
running a class there are other standard

536
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:21,920
key in kind of hard target they do a lot
of patrols they pay attention they knew

537
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,180
that we were coming and then they were
ready and they weren't gonna lose so

538
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:30,379
that out of some some challenge to it
and itself so basically we walked around

539
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:37,029
our long range i class reader in the bag
around the campus they had some areas

540
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:41,410
where some of the public could get you
very easy to discover a stroll in and

541
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:46,640
get close to some of the employees of
the company to get back to the hotel the

542
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,578
whole bunch of cards because you don't
know what's going to work where so you

543
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:53,710
just used to make a whole stack and hope
that one of them work

544
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:59,368
watch the guards to figure out where
they were one of the day

545
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:06,560
we've got our own carpenter carpenter to
from eBay at highly discounted read so

546
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,540
you know a little a couple photos online
a couple photos in person like I come up

547
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:16,779
with a pretty good mock up there I D
card so you could print it from this is

548
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,990
actually a model better than the printer
they used so when they did start to

549
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:24,279
examine the figure ideas that we made
they couldn't tell but they were fake

550
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,480
because they looked identical to the
ones that they have to watch the guards

551
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,320
we noticed that everybody left at like 4
o'clock on this one station and at left

552
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:40,880
guard station open and the tower was
just sitting on the floor so we want to

553
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:47,210
put some hardware keyloggers on there
and let it sit all day came back the

554
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:51,570
next night after everybody had looked
older dog pulled off her credentials so

555
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:55,550
you get their domain credentials while
you know while you're at it and their

556
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:59,870
credentials to secure which is their
access control system and a whole bunch

557
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:05,900
of other good stuff to duplicate cards
for like they're really good employees

558
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:11,020
access to the server but you know you
needed internal network access for it

559
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:15,660
but that was ok because they had a
wireless network and because we had

560
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,730
domain credentials we can get onto the
wireless network from the parking lot

561
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:24,960
and look at the physical access server
for reasons but I don't quite understand

562
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:32,200
the folks that makes your decided to
make a mobile client as well so you know

563
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,270
when the guards opened the turnstile
political theater and you know they can

564
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:41,670
they can press buttons to temporarily
unlock doors will they decided to to put

565
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:46,270
that in a mobile app so that you could
do that from your phone which is very

566
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:50,290
convenient for the folks who have to
administer it like the guard but it's

567
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:54,830
also very convenient for me from the
parking lot on their wireless network

568
00:47:54,830 --> 00:48:00,420
we're able to just walk whatever door we
wanted any given time to really we could

569
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,300
just have walked somebody completely
through the building

570
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:10,330
without a card at all at that point so
they weren't happy they had a lot of

571
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:15,990
good controls but it wasn't quite put
together properly so I'm working on some

572
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:21,529
ways to really help to bridge this gap
between physical access folks in

573
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:26,360
nineteen security folks common language
is gonna be one of our biggest barriers

574
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,790
I think we're gonna check list for all
these things that we just talked about

575
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:36,540
keeping your environment if you're if
you're in order to do an audit of that

576
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:41,320
system you're doing an internal Warner
building says manicuring risk you know

577
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:47,290
if you're in physical security and it's
gonna take pics of village it's gonna

578
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:51,400
take a village gonna take help from the
network folks it's gonna take help from

579
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,920
the iraqi security folks working with
the physical folks to really get the

580
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:02,190
system was down properly so that's and
draft it's almost ready for release so

581
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:07,680
that is ready we'll have it up on the
website sorry we can answer questions

582
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,879
about it we can come in and help you
with it sometimes it works very well

583
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,750
when we come in to assess this is Jen
because it gives everybody is somebody

584
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:22,880
in common to be mad because it creates
tension of the VIP folks tell the

585
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,090
physical security folks of their system
is busted and it it sucks and we have to

586
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,890
fix it so if they're all mad at me

587
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:37,100
the work together better I'm over my
time so I'm gonna get out of the way I

588
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:42,620
hope this was exciting enough substitute
for BYOD I will do questions probably

589
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:46,720
out here so we're gonna rock the next
presentation so thank you very much

590
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,959
