1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,870
object to get home put in my mind she
has done that treated to a friends but

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,070
he obviously wanted to have a discussion
about ten years ago

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:18,750
games like World of Warcraft right
shoulder they went massively online as

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:27,660
it is folly still sold your quiet then
you had to talk to subscribe to be able

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,219
to access the servers this was
especially interesting business model

6
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,730
that I hope will be good for the first
time I can play not just the right form

7
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:47,399
some sheen to it as 2,000 people
simultaneously right now for big deal

8
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,449
the smartphone right the first time ever
who were all that is much more powerful

9
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,570
than desktops as did not grow

10
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,469
you ask most people was the very first
thing she studies of the no was the

11
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:12,400
first thing you people downloading and
going on into mobile and most of the

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,409
ones that are always at the top of the
top grossing

13
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:29,880
paradoxically free to play free download
but by giving by small things and it's

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,829
our lives not on just getting the game
on somebody's farm but looking people at

15
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:42,539
a game that they keep playing over time
as they introduce new features and new

16
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:52,439
ways to my house and these games last
year right you saw on the Superbowl like

17
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:59,429
the Holy Grail so that's how big these
games and desperate to attract players

18
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,430
because unfortunately just like

19
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:12,420
absolutely everything is getting harder
and harder to differentiate them from

20
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:20,000
the competition so giant counties like
these guys get a whole host of others

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:32,480
who are just hoping that the next and so
broad so this model is so profitable for

22
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,200
the online just online so it's just a
tough no duty to research published

23
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,470
there and we'll review as I like how
much you know he's made just on your

24
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:55,030
father your PlayStation Network codes
generator 63 billion dollars being 2013

25
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:04,030
and that is why take first hollywood
movies you know all these big movies 38

26
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:13,519
so you know just about twice as much a
lot of money is right but a lot smaller

27
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:25,329
and generated through 31 publisher parts
just online sales for their traditional

28
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:32,049
34 that last year so it's very probable
that it's easy for people it's fresh

29
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:43,359
unless you know from banking is that
fraudsters always follow the money they

30
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:48,549
don't care where it is there not being
rude or not wizards there just isn't

31
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:55,120
right and if you think about it this is
true you know about cancer versus banks

32
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:04,690
are there not regularly to report to the
FBI after by sea like banks do you know

33
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,170
a lot of times he's stealing things in
games not even private just in terms of

34
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,089
service

35
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:15,629
and so what that means is that a lot of
guys who are refined tools like stands

36
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:24,860
dealer for other industries like banking
just able to retire and how this is

37
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,360
happening

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,650
Indians in a big way and this is what a
lot of this is actually a screenshot

39
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:39,599
from customers credit is actually pretty
easy to virtualize that dropped out

40
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:53,050
random gaming Strike Global Select
Market so you'll get one of these will

41
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:59,010
sell it somebody party site for real
money trading system

42
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:06,330
traded over but now takeover is so rapid
this is why because people happy in

43
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:12,830
their house and for taking a special and
very strict about and it's just like a

44
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:32,889
slut and that's what are some of the
high-end very rare form of thousands but

45
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:37,710
there is more than a takeover going on
so there are scams like gold farming

46
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,710
where people will actually just gather
mundane virtual resources are you know

47
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:49,969
like charles Rangel right well yeah you
it's worth things trade for other

48
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,800
personal items in the game and so we've
got a lot of it is just like any other

49
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:10,780
virtual currency value 31 you know
hundreds of special customers just once

50
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,780
and we actually found it was worth

51
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:23,200
for some of these guys r straight so
that stored on your help with a lot of

52
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:32,900
people to purchase those items from the
store store sells them for a fraction of

53
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:42,890
the cost on a trademark why not losing
any money but I also notice that charge

54
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:52,950
they're gonna say no i didnt is the
publisher response clock back so what's

55
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,950
so when we first started the company

56
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,090
accelerator here in Columbus Aliant a
salary Columbus

57
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:07,300
one and we spend time building our own
time and we should I had the timing we

58
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:14,790
talking to some contacts in the industry
and so I talked about you know well what

59
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:28,430
are you doing now and what is not so
they were actually talking about their

60
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:35,850
incredibly opening the gate a lot of
really good information so they tried

61
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:44,480
all traditional stuff they tried to you
all those things and what's interesting

62
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:51,460
is a lot of solutions iraq to recognize
the original banking but they lost

63
00:07:51,460 --> 00:08:04,120
because the banks stopped using them so
I am sells a chance and now actually

64
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,720
something worked for a while because
we're seeing and are fundamentally

65
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:28,360
thanks a lot of us so it but it still
works because there's not helping

66
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,610
matters in place and offline access
right because these are people that

67
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:42,250
buying things they don't want security
products a lot of folks at the tax so

68
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,570
they can get away with something that
never thought and other industries

69
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:57,250
this one somebody said this and try to
resolve the problem with using bank

70
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:05,950
tools to secure my games has turned into
that have two different types of games

71
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,850
have different problems as well so far
have a lot of other life late for work

72
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:18,310
at the Sheldon was playing games and it
takes a lot to build up a lot of

73
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:28,150
resources are reselling so that people
can actually loved account automatically

74
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:42,040
they just sell your with top-level a
loss for overtime for your time saving a

75
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,640
market stall generate been credibly just
gonna come right back

76
00:09:48,220 --> 00:10:02,450
a new social casino games that you
cannot ship so surely played for final

77
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:11,350
more about those sheeting and collusion
so that's when players will together on

78
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:18,210
the plane together against the rules
going to try and win and that's a whole

79
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:25,459
different thing because in real money
and those guys huge issue not only

80
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:30,500
because they are trying to sell but
they're being used for money laundering

81
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,970
cybercrimes totally makes sense if you
think you're buying jewelry line casino

82
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,750
and then lose all your mind to another
player and I got a portrayal of that

83
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:54,470
money goes to get somebody to talk to
about what they're doing this said well

84
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:01,000
you must be so they don't have turned on
their teams they usually hurry turning

85
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,480
on and then they do for us 67 what's in
the past

86
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:15,370
create some rules this is and what's
right and this is actually making

87
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:21,339
company is is that exact same thing to
go about their own solutions but you may

88
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:27,650
ask our people and our customers we
should be able to do this problem though

89
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:34,530
is that expensive but we were some
reports for eleven years I you know that

90
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,600
they're probably expensive to own right
but over time especially when you got

91
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:47,570
people change and because a rule-based
system can be observed that does right

92
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,060
so what they were doing yesterday
suddenly stopped working so they know

93
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,119
they're on the subject to change their
behavior off until it starts working

94
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,770
another train delays on what the rule is
that stopping and so now they just it

95
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,350
over and over and over again

96
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,540
yeah I suggested changes to my rules
engine for the last month or two but it

97
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,500
was getting pushed the bottle there's
always other I T things that are more

98
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:25,290
important happening why these factors
are all over there constantly looking as

99
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:32,860
they always are not really sure how to
fix it and the most important thing is

100
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:40,650
really more than about the money because
the damage done to the game if they want

101
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:47,839
to play overtime games no longer fun for
you to stop her

102
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,930
satisfy something tell it to you later
and tell right that's true and expensive

103
00:12:53,930 --> 00:13:04,870
for what a wired and you want to have a
bunch of china's coal for its just so

104
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,980
they are really worried about the
reputational damage to the reason why is

105
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:14,050
because even very large studios are
finding a lot of his underdog you know

106
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:23,589
reputation is all you got her employers
not remember that and you know this is a

107
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:31,790
focus point developers not for
publishers this article and he was a

108
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:41,319
studio remember your publisher and was
it your publisher doesn't help keep your

109
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:49,400
name security scanner do the right
things is going to hurt you know she is

110
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,230
your reputation and much much harder
especially in emerging market to get a

111
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,709
chance you got about her tuition with
the players

112
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:09,368
talked about in a specific case study
that we did for March over sure where we

113
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:15,990
actually got some interesting statistics
about what is actually costs was

114
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:25,670
actually going on so that we did we just
ended it was a social casino game I

115
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:36,569
can't seem to be able to understand why
if you plan on Facebook you're playing

116
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:45,920
games probably change how can we mark
that we actually study was a very large

117
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,339
name that was a social teams to play
poker in this was not a real money so

118
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:57,179
they could not cash out their chest but
really wonder selling it and see you

119
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:01,259
know I think you can in that case you
can buy $100 worth of virtual ship's

120
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:08,569
right over $200 million dollars chips
right so what they're selling the fans

121
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:14,628
here going all-in I don't know then that
in texas holdem poker table that's real

122
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:22,329
that you gave us on the line is great
when you lose the way that our customers

123
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:30,209
and chips through their story actually
is a great thing for that there are a

124
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:36,498
lot of fun had a thirteen and a half
million players and they were making

125
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:38,699
$100,000

126
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:49,829
now it's interesting is that they were
going through mobile Facebook this over

127
00:15:49,829 --> 00:16:01,008
and get told that have multi-factor
authentication on vacation they also got

128
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:06,960
itself was in the App Store we were
relieved to be proved highly doubt that

129
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,800
the Nevada game we're not going to
happen so this was purely a straight up

130
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:20,750
you know commercial so there are no how
was it all on the fact that they had the

131
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:28,890
most expensive that transaction so they
think they had everything set right now

132
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:33,900
so we're very eccentric so it wasn't
like a lot of customers we have in our

133
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:44,010
lives turned on this is going to sound
so they decided that they had everything

134
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:51,290
just because they knew they had this
problem when you search for buy cheap

135
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,560
over chairs with your name on it

136
00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:02,140
you actually see see their product page
7 everything else was some chips for a

137
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:13,609
fraction as so basically they responded
to this by having people manual he wanna

138
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:14,919
play

139
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,020
literally looking and playback of what
was going on

140
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,970
hoping something will trigger the
spiders they would know that playing

141
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,850
right around the world

142
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:32,209
cost them to this report

143
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:42,380
differences difficult part every day
they saw not only to decide to not go

144
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:50,440
away but their prices down a lot of
acquisition leading them to raise their

145
00:17:50,440 --> 00:18:01,250
prices so they have to be 100 percent of
all our players for 90 days so we

146
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:08,450
stopped by rules be used pure when he
start fighting monitor everybody reading

147
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:15,480
was like normal good behavior and that
is our first pass bounced back after

148
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:30,820
2012 models that translate to when you
look at the sheer exhilaration so great

149
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:48,840
market they were losing about 40% of
$1.40 per number and you can tell you

150
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:58,870
know what it is like if you think about
trying to operate your profits or

151
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:04,560
revenue falling up a lot and was really
about this number is when I first

152
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:12,770
started talking to all publishers and I
asked them you know ok well let me know

153
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:39,170
for sure when I pressed the first time I
kept hearing the number really did enjoy

154
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:46,660
a large market got so I think these guys
really onto something I think it's the

155
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,930
kind of the problem know where you got
that right now there's tons of water

156
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,709
everybody's like getting into gaming
down on them like mad and so there's a

157
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:05,280
lot more water as everyone's happy but
it was actually that's going to change

158
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:16,129
and when that changes and change the
popularity so the whole lot smaller

159
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:26,990
players you know if you've no financial
gain investors and you took you to

160
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,960
nothing bucs

161
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:37,090
million bucks to market your language is
actually the ratio is expecting the

162
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:45,800
models that back her likeness a 24 to 36
months you can strip on my bad you know

163
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,850
good luck trying to get science and that
hurts everybody that's why I say that's

164
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:57,559
because it not only best games of all
teams are coming up behind them because

165
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:02,940
it's going to be hard especially for
smaller and mid-sized make them because

166
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:18,030
they won't have also made for you guys
to security professionals ever tasked

167
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:24,240
with protecting one of these types of
organizations with the get out because

168
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:41,760
that's what they are locked up there are
perfect for its ok there's no I know I

169
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,760
tried to talk to our keynote speaker

170
00:21:47,510 --> 00:22:00,890
you know I every time that happens only
a tiny fraction so the guys you know

171
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,100
especially groups and companies

172
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:10,909
countries were visually this time so
what do they care so if you're a

173
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,910
security professional players

174
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:32,590
strong lots of studying what people who
is it passed by our defenses what are

175
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:39,570
they and what are they doing inside
today also measuring the right now

176
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:48,620
because just tells you on Friday that he
really that's true that might actually

177
00:22:48,620 --> 00:23:03,979
be just like wow did not know that the
Jews are very careful skeptical look for

178
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:11,390
things that is strange and your study
authors were released early as possible

179
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:17,020
I recommend that you start measuring
things pakistan paid it right because we

180
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:24,930
see tons of guys filter tools in women
involved with a dose of pre-release

181
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:32,730
version became a lot of policies
marketing like it but it's really not

182
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:41,630
testing and so that I sign up and gave
us a table for tolls because on release

183
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:48,390
day that's what most people most excited
and they wanted to be part of something

184
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:56,080
and that's one out of 10 again that
already running just a soon

185
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,210
you know and and what they're doing now

186
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:14,289
analytics for your plans mostly from
corporate secretaries to try to figure

187
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:22,559
out how to monetize these games so a lot
of this stuff out

188
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:42,129
monetize Caldwell right out there all
right how long they go out and studying

189
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:49,830
the variable stars I can tell them what
happened just trying to find a house we

190
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:58,039
close our unusual differently from
suspects something that the industry is

191
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:08,460
is really bad because not all know if
you have to understand things on your

192
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:23,500
mind always tell you when something
hurts people yesterday I actually found

193
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:36,080
things that need to happen but they
never got a lot of $1.99 some support

194
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,110
tools used by workers are not support
developers

195
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:53,719
certain variables and so that they don't
want to get in the game which means that

196
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,659
if you put it cool and the client was
over your head on rival

197
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:12,370
glad you came in just eight games that
are healthy and making money are costly

198
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,400
changing the environment on purpose

199
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:26,209
all the time which means not under rules
harder and harder to anything that is

200
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:52,530
going to change for a challenge you know
obviously Election Commission then that

201
00:26:52,530 --> 00:27:00,440
are unusual for the difference between
that and you know already making

202
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:16,420
something to a computer first tells the
day got the right people look at the

203
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:34,440
list of things hundreds and they don't
know which one this is much talk so much

204
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:51,700
everybody else informative to people
this is what will happen when the FBI

205
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,389
was doing better

206
00:27:53,389 --> 00:28:07,269
said there was no question that has to
do with you know let's play this is just

207
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:07,820
plain wrong

208
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:23,139
just play us but you know I guarantee
you that make a living writing sessions

209
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:35,389
also questioned him on Twitter on and
off the water so thanks very much

210
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:36,839
everybody enjoy the rest of the show
