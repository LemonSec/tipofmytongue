1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,250
talk about is just some general
high-level techniques that the modern

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,410
cybercriminal is using for covert
communications

3
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,190
a great thing

4
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,679
about hidden communications the the
great poets of New York City the Beastie

5
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,940
Boys they once had a song started off
let it flow let yourself go slow and low

6
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,460
that is the tempo and that is basically
how these cyber criminals are using

7
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,380
their hidden communications right so
when you look at a command control and

8
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,339
you're looking at the type of behavior
that these folks are exhibiting the

9
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,240
ultimately they don't get caught right i
mean they are going to move at a pace

10
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,730
that evades detection and so forth in
there are many ways to hide the one

11
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,859
thing to remember throughout this
presentation is that the attacker owns

12
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,340
typically both ends of the session right
so we'll just keep that in mind we can

13
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,440
revisit that name and number of times
but the biggest thing right is is really

14
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,340
the two areas that we're looking at her
hidden communications are command

15
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,550
control and data exfiltration and when
you look at the types of protocols and

16
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:49,090
applications you know even protocols
like ICMP can be used at all the other

17
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,250
piece to is we we talk about some of the
themes in this this presentation is the

18
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,790
concepts and tenants around the cyber
attack killed chain and most of Europe

19
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:05,450
familiar with with these techniques but
again when we look at hidden

20
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:12,130
communications there are few areas that
stick out typically you know my employer

21
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,930
and the products that we make and sell
to our customers we divide the types of

22
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,480
CNC and really two places one is your
commodity botnet Bitcoin mining and so

23
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,560
forth but more or less the the bottom
tier with those targeted attacks or

24
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,260
those ones constructed specifically for
a high impact organization maybe where

25
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,149
the attack will occur over several weeks
or months in throughout those points

26
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,270
right i mean

27
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:48,260
the points of interest right of the the
areas that could be hidden to command

28
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,989
control the exploration and so when we
look at the types of behaviors and I'm

29
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,890
gonna use that word quite a bit weird to
be mindful of number one where to look

30
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,620
how to look and how much we should be
approaching this problem a little bit

31
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:12,720
differently so let's just talk really
quickly about C&C servers just like you

32
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,700
know and have probably heard the the
term indicators of compromise a few

33
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,590
times over the last couple days the
attacking entities behave the same way

34
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,989
right they look for indicators of
detection and what they'll do is they'll

35
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:33,160
look for ways to look at techniques to
give validation that you know that I

36
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,320
know that you know that I attacked you
and when that does occur though get into

37
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:45,219
these you know the domain generation
algorithm rotation business and they'll

38
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,580
start popping around and changing their
location or changing where the C&C

39
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,900
traffic originates to and from was going
to tools like you know commodity tools

40
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,340
like Gmail Dropbox and others that are
being used for for CNC we're gonna talk

41
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,310
about that simply put though the reuse
of command control that can lead to

42
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,870
getting caught from these individuals
you know they start using and

43
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:20,390
continuously used the same locations you
know that could lead to their attack not

44
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:25,169
being successful so we're going to talk
about his behavior quite a bit today I

45
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:30,380
mentioned that before there's some
fundamental tenets around behavior

46
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,550
that's that's interesting there are
elements of any type of packet that

47
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:45,169
attack the continuously change IP
addresses URLs hashes domains so on and

48
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:46,289
so forth

49
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,130
underlying throughout all of those
elements is consistent behavior from one

50
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,249
attack to the next

51
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:56,709
or a group or a family of attacks
they're going to exhibit the same exact

52
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,549
behavior

53
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:04,729
the other piece to that i think is very
important is just having the source of

54
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:10,159
truth and the way we do business avec
drugs were in the business of collecting

55
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:14,519
packets and looking at them as the
source of truth when I using summary

56
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:19,999
information or log generation but we're
actually looking at packets both

57
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:25,719
encrypted and unencrypted and that
provides very valuable information

58
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:30,998
around covert communications and then we
expect the attackers to play games of

59
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:35,489
hide and seek right they're gonna bury
themselves within DNS for example or

60
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:42,688
ICMP or http so we're gonna see these
types of behaviors exhibited and really

61
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:48,499
than the there's a few components in
looking at this problem right there is

62
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:55,989
how to how to approach this so the words
machine learning and data science I'm

63
00:06:55,989 --> 00:07:00,209
sure that those are terms that have been
overheard or discussed over the past

64
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:05,059
couple of days they're not buzzwords are
actually real and so there's a couple

65
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:08,699
elements and approaches to doing this
type of activity when you look at

66
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,439
supervised learning and the wave vector
does it is we take massive samples of

67
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,919
malware and malicious traffic and we
profile and build statistical

68
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:24,959
mathematical models based on what are
the common attributes of a commanding

69
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,249
control session has are different than
normal user traffic what are the flow

70
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:36,199
types what's the pace what's the cadence
within that particular session and

71
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,199
inherently with that allows us to do is
to get out of the business of this

72
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,969
extended learning process there's no
local learning for supervised algorithms

73
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:49,479
to to work they can detect things very
instantly the unsupervised learning

74
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:55,669
piece is based on behavior so for
example there's a few attributes comment

75
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:58,669
to human beings want is you know time
and

76
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:05,860
frequency and patterns and you know the
types of systems that you go to on a

77
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,920
day-to-day basis the title credentials
used for Kerberos and so once that

78
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,430
pattern establishes and there's a
profile built on who you are it's very

79
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:23,690
mathematically you know certain to
predict and determined deviations from

80
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,830
that pattern that there's a set of
credentials that originated from your

81
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,929
host that you've never used before to a
system that you've never talked to

82
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,150
before for example so data science right
i mean this is this is an approach to

83
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,250
looking at these patterns getting out of
the business of signatures

84
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:54,420
let's talk a little bit about hiding
within encryption to more more trash

85
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,430
days encrypted right i mean if you have
a cloud service with most of the time

86
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,029
but if all that's going to be encrypted
outbound but I guess by show of hands

87
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:07,279
who's concerned about malware or any
type of malicious traffic is being

88
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,339
encrypted on the outbound I would expect
that most of you are and it's a

89
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:13,860
difficult problem to solve

90
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,320
there's one you know aspect right I mean
I talk to a lot of folks and customers

91
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,490
that are considering you know packet
inspection in in data collection

92
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,120
strategies where basically they decrypt
everything but that's effectively a

93
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,810
massive shift and yet to start getting
in the business of managing certs

94
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,589
there's anybody from verifying the room
they were downstairs well represented

95
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:42,850
but that that's effectively that one
technique and approaching for that

96
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:48,959
problem again I mentioned before when
you're looking at SSL you're looking at

97
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:56,099
both ends of the session now the the
other aspect to is you know that it's

98
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,630
just going to continue to others going
to continue to be more and more

99
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,899
encryption and it's going to become more
and more difficult I guess if you're

100
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:08,529
looking at deep packet inspection types
of technologies to to address problems

101
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:13,220
if you're looking at payloads for you
know known behaviors and so forth

102
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:19,019
let's talk let's just do a quick poll do
you decrypt your network traffic for

103
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,660
security inspection today for any of
those who decrypt everything can I get a

104
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:32,779
show of hands one ok some traffic is
selectively decrypted by policy less

105
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,209
than 10 notes

106
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:38,899
traffic is decrypted I don't today but
I'm planning in the future

107
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,990
ok so that suggests really where we're
all out from a baseline perspective most

108
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,079
of us are facing the problem of you know
encrypted tunnels and being unable to

109
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:57,459
possibly look into the payloads are
looking into the the traditional areas

110
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:01,949
that one would look to identify
malicious behavior so how do we solve

111
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:11,219
this problem so the use of Sherlock
Holmes fictitious detectives little you

112
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,589
know interesting I guess for this
analogy but the the quote is I think

113
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:18,589
applies when you're looking at the the
individual

114
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:25,199
the puzzle is somewhat in soil Bowl but
when you look at the group there are

115
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:31,719
mathematical and statistical certainty
is right so what do I mean by that we

116
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,279
don't have to look at an individual and
in fingerprinted to know exactly what

117
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,850
the behavior is what if we look at the
flow we can see a pattern for example

118
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,309
and within data science and machine
learning techniques

119
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:49,579
this is true as well so what do we do
when we look at one of the models built

120
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:56,248
around to reveal underlying behavior so
the one is communication cadence who's

121
00:11:56,249 --> 00:12:00,170
in control of the session the second is
which

122
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:06,189
yes then you know who's losing control
of the session and then just the session

123
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:10,420
looked to be automated or is it a human
driven session so for example if I'm

124
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,949
using a web browser and I'm initiating
the outbound its gonna originated from

125
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:21,378
finding out versus outside the end to
end then you know that there's some

126
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:23,540
entity on the outside

127
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,868
dictating commands and controlling the
flow of a particular session

128
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:32,980
these are all elements available within
the header of the packet whether it's

129
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:38,279
encrypted or not so when we look at the

130
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:43,529
distinctive patterns of malicious
traffic right i mean again you know we

131
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:49,689
can look at the flows in the sequences
that's that's one element of it and

132
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:54,920
there's so what details are available so
we can you know that's how we build

133
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,870
models around you know our command
control detections within our product

134
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:05,360
and using the use of DAT of data science
so again when you're looking at the

135
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,550
patterns I mean you're looking for in a
potential command control instructions

136
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,849
what remote access tools are available
that originating from the outsider

137
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,129
what's the cadence it is originating
from the inside

138
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:25,220
malware updates and so on and so forth
so again these are all very tangible and

139
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:33,860
mathematical types of details that we
can create algorithms against so when

140
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,370
you look at I guess warden Norton in
these inspecting the tunnel that Andy

141
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:47,740
Dufresne used to get out of Shawshank we
also recognize the fact that these are

142
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:53,509
present in modern networks today and
their techniques that are used by

143
00:13:53,509 --> 00:14:00,660
attackers to basically hide and
obfuscate there you know the types of

144
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,009
activity that they're doing so what we
see this end we see an HTTP we see it as

145
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:11,250
a sell we see it in DNS it's available
and ICMP there's a ton of different ways

146
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:20,519
to hide and create tunnels within normal
protocols for example it becomes very

147
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:27,529
difficult to create signatures and
continuously match patterns when one or

148
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:32,509
changing on a day-to-day basis and
secondly you may have liberal album

149
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:36,069
policies that permit these protocols
their their their business

150
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:43,020
legitimate I guess for lack of better
terms and it's very difficult to take a

151
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:49,750
legitimate protocol constantly inspect
it and especially if you have hidden

152
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:56,820
messages in in optional fields for
example are fragmented packets that have

153
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:03,880
messages strong throughout you know
different different packets within that

154
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,490
flow that the darker over a long period
of time so it again once again you know

155
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,529
the signature or the the creation of a
pattern matching becomes very difficult

156
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:20,779
in this in this scenario again like when
you're looking at HTTP or HTTPS

157
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:28,990
interpreter is a good example use over
SSL very difficult to potentially detect

158
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,380
with with common signature-based tools
but again we're considered in we're

159
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:40,290
concerned with the behavior of these
types of tunnels specifically with the

160
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:47,829
matter we're looking at the patterns
once again so what what we found within

161
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:53,170
our study we collect metadata from
customers that choose to opt-in we're

162
00:15:53,170 --> 00:16:00,640
seeing this uptick on I guess hidden
tunnels in in in more importantly the

163
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,420
use of SSL so you over year we've seen
this this progression

164
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:13,110
the use of HTTPS but as you can see we
have both command control and data

165
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:18,399
export take data exfiltration
represented by the types of tunnels that

166
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,250
our customers of experience within their
own environments DNS interestingly

167
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:30,100
enough is using her ex filtration is
using DNS tunnels to tunnel data out of

168
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,040
the environment

169
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,469
let's talk a little bit about hiding
within allowed applications anybody

170
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,509
watch walking dead in this room

171
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:48,259
handful case everybody knows or those
who watch there's a technique that that

172
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:53,089
the survivors used to blend in with the
zombies and not get bitten or whatever

173
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:57,500
and they just effectively cut open a
zombie and rub blood and guts on

174
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:05,039
themselves and their allowed basically
roamed freely with the dead undetected

175
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:11,709
and if you're hiding within a loud
applications like this example there's a

176
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:16,220
snare did anybody read about this the
the use of Gmail and the drafts folder

177
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,220
to act as a command-and-control

178
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:29,070
fashion and effectively using some using
a hidden browser using the drafts folder

179
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:34,110
within Gmail to issue command control
commands down to the infected client

180
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:41,110
what's interesting about this right is
most organizations are going to consider

181
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:47,280
gmail a legitimate application they're
going to consider Dropbox a considered a

182
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,070
legitimate application and so on and so
forth but again it's it's something that

183
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:58,980
it's it's very difficult impossible to
construct signatures again that can be

184
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:07,150
repeated over time to provide visibility
into what's actually happening

185
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:16,230
so rather than using the the animal
classification scheme King Philip came

186
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,050
over for grape soda or whatever was that
we all learned back in the day instead

187
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:25,990
of trying to name every species on the
planet by the way there were two hundred

188
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:33,920
new species learned in Asia just last
year it's it's it's it's an uphill

189
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,870
battle right there's a million I guess
there's the latest data point on how

190
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,060
much how many new variants of malware
come out per day it's impossible to do

191
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:48,899
so rather than name everything we're
going to focus again on behavior and

192
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,400
looking at patterns and understanding
because it's gmail I can't write it

193
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,240
necessarily write a signature around it
but I can look at the behavior and

194
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,770
understand that within this permitted
business application I have a

195
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:14,550
command-and-control session running so
again let's not call it what it does

196
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:19,560
what it looks like Gmail let's focus on
what is actually doing from a behavioral

197
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,840
perspective again just you know just a
couple more points on this there is

198
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,830
never an email message sent within this
session is just commands from the the

199
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:35,070
draft folder down to the infected host
so again this is something

200
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:44,790
mathematically we can easily detect in
and demonstrate so what does that look

201
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:51,159
like right there's a within a commanding
control on the wire you're gonna see

202
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,860
sets of instructions right there's gonna
be there is you know and directionality

203
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,649
is a big deal when you're looking at
this type of behavior especially if it's

204
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:06,200
encrypted so who's initiating the
section that the session and in this

205
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:13,040
case on a polling scenario you have a
client that's initiating queries but

206
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,629
basically to the outbound C&C server
asking what's the next step what do I do

207
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:23,520
next and effectively that's what
happened with this this gmail instance

208
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:31,500
no question so within this room I guess
what would you think poses the greatest

209
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:39,150
risk is it you know a cloud-based
applications with Facebook Gmail Dropbox

210
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:46,360
and others agree agree with a in his
room he would be cloud-based

211
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:53,229
applications file share CRM CRM tools
see on prime applications and D ITN

212
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:59,510
admin tools the short answer I guess
when I've had this conversation before a

213
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:04,390
lot of folks are concerned about a and
they're concerned about you know there

214
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:10,870
is a Taiwanese time bomb event that
occurred using Dropbox so these

215
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,870
legitimate tools that we all used in

216
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:21,500
in our business environments being
permitted as if there be there as

217
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,120
advertised but underneath under the
covers with in the packet where the

218
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,060
truth lies as malicious activity and
behavior occurring so let's talk a

219
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:37,220
little bit about remote access and
there's any game of Thrones fans in this

220
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,830
room we all know that brand has this
innate ability to control his dire wolf

221
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:47,010
and instruct them to rip the throats out
of any threat potentially to him or

222
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:52,500
others but when you're looking at remote
access right i mean there's there's

223
00:21:52,500 --> 00:22:00,390
really a few components and at some
point within a kill chain based attack

224
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:05,160
there becomes a shift from automation to
human control at some point there's

225
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:12,430
gonna be a set of fingertips on a
keyboard in some nation you know state

226
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:19,620
environment that's gonna take over in
control and generally the presence of a

227
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:27,449
remote access tool kit suggests that you
know the next phase or advancement in

228
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,950
that attack is going to occur so what
are the constructs around that right I

229
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:40,750
mean there's there's definitely some
things that were that require

230
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,830
consideration when there's a lot of
tools used within you know normal

231
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:51,129
business that look and feel like remote
access tools web acts GoToMeeting so on

232
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:55,670
and so forth there's a lot of remote
control tools out there but again we

233
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:01,270
have to understand too when does the
shift happen is there a presence of an

234
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:07,420
existing command-and-control session
existing behavior within that hosts and

235
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:12,920
then subsequently a shift over to
something that looks and feels like a

236
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,920
like a wrap for example

237
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:24,519
so we look at the connection side of
things there might be an origination

238
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:29,870
point from the inside to go to go back
out that might be automation piece to

239
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:35,518
start the process the remote access is
now in place and now we have to

240
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:41,049
understand what's the pattern like from
the remote attacker to the inside user

241
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:45,019
their breaks within the communication
and where those breaks initiate to and

242
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:57,940
from RSA today a recent discovery this
was early I guess fall of 2015 of a iraq

243
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:04,249
called glass rat and 102 undetected for
a three-year period and what they ended

244
00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:10,259
up doing is they were using a valid
search for my software company in China

245
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:17,169
and basically when are they tested this
it failed 57 individual antivirus

246
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:22,379
providers in terms of detection so you
know again these are types of things

247
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:29,639
that they can evade known technologies
and they're gonna look heard they're

248
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:34,418
going to fall below the radar but they
ended up doing now is they were able to

249
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:41,029
identify a dropper which you know at
that time there were no signatures

250
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:49,059
present for that dropper and they were
able to identify and then start backing

251
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:57,639
into where this this attack originated
from but again it's when we looked at it

252
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:02,519
right it did show up as a remote access
tunnel once once it was

253
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:09,750
you know remote access tool once this
this well once this became widely

254
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,150
available are they published their their
paper on this we took a look at it

255
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:21,240
within our labs and again at its back to
behavior behave very similar 22 netcat

256
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:28,450
in this case so lastly let's talk a
little bit about anonymous haitian and

257
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,020
again just obscuring identity

258
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:39,850
you know hiding where were originating
with original sources and so really the

259
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:45,840
two techniques it we're going to talk
about her tour and peer-to-peer and I

260
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,090
think mostly you're familiar with the
under Onion Router and effectively this

261
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:57,350
is a common technique you know both
inside and outside to obscure the point

262
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,510
of origin basically you're hopping and
routing you know at different points

263
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:09,940
until you reach your desired egress node
and at that point your your your native

264
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:16,340
sources effectively hidden and it's also
encrypted by to fall but with towards

265
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:24,470
very recognizable within a a pattern in
mathematical sequence the other 12 is

266
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:30,090
around peer-to-peer in when you look at
peer-to-peer pretty resilient right of a

267
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,300
node fails then they can bounce to the
next one in reestablishing

268
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:39,030
command-and-control presence so it's
it's jumping around in again this is

269
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:46,270
something to be known as the bullet
point suggest I mean is very resistant

270
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:51,760
to to takedown attempts for the command
control simply because it can rotate in

271
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,760
and shift around but

272
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,850
you know again these types of techniques
you know the the whole theme of this

273
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:05,899
right is very easy to detect from a
statistical and mathematical model using

274
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:13,389
data science the other woman

275
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:18,689
to be aware of two is when we're looking
at traffic within an internal

276
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,549
environment right so I've been talking
about Tori been talking about

277
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:28,629
peer-to-peer and those are going to go
inside the outer outside in but you know

278
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:35,029
there's another technique used to stage
traffic potentially for exfiltration and

279
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:39,109
in some cases right this might not even
be a human operated device it could be

280
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:44,249
just an IRT device that could be proxy
setup somewhere but again this is a

281
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:49,099
behavior and a technique used to
potentially export trade data out of the

282
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:54,049
environment one of the things that we
proved within our own labs and this

283
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:59,629
isn't necessarily rocket science writer
is mainly a an objective to I guess

284
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:07,168
prove the point is within our own labs
we showed the ability to break into a a

285
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:17,070
camera and basically install a remote
access to get into that camera and

286
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:22,918
there's well documented use cases out
there with medical devices infusion

287
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:29,309
pumps in on the fact that a lot of
vendors are even consumers of these

288
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:34,168
devices they leave static passwords in
there the default passwords simply

289
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:37,440
because if you have a service technician

290
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,820
maybe they're the ones I know that but
it's it's certainly the next point where

291
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:50,239
we're going to have some concern because
again these are non human operated

292
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:51,369
devices

293
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:56,799
there's a degree of automation built in
and then when they do become exploited

294
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:06,539
and used in in a way to help obfuscated
you know outbound communications you

295
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,650
know it's it's it's gonna create a lot
more pressure on us so

296
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:16,440
the biggest thing though is is again
just the behavior lament so just to

297
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,330
summarize on on what we talked about
right in hidden communications are

298
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:29,419
definitely you know persistent and most
attacks and again the thing to remember

299
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:37,170
is looking at the control side of things
right so where is the worst recession

300
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:41,530
being controlled from is it remotely or
is it locally these are very easy things

301
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:49,280
to pick up with in the the actual packet
headers in spite of encryption I would

302
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,149
say this right signatures are unsuited
for you know trying to solve problems

303
00:29:54,150 --> 00:30:01,770
especially as the the number of new
variants is just growing by the day and

304
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:06,790
when we're looking at behavior and we
look at the example of Dropbox or Gmail

305
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:12,200
we can't necessarily write a signature
for that your policy suggests that those

306
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:19,240
are gonna be allowed out locations
within your environment and if we're if

307
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,400
it looks like Gmail but it you know is
doing something else then we have to

308
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:30,750
look at the behavior and so finally to
the the actions right i mean again that

309
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,900
those are going to be present as well
and and the supervised and unsupervised

310
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:41,940
learning data science approach will
allow us to do not produce valid

311
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:50,520
detections around these new creative
ways that attackers are using so with

312
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,520
that

313
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:00,160
minutes back I appreciate your time any
questions at this point yes sir

314
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:20,840
was ever seen any covert communications
with games with TCP sequencing numbers

315
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,840
and so forth

316
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:58,830
I haven't seen a person with my product
with any other customers and I'm working

317
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:05,129
with but I mean I do know that you know
manipulation of the sequence numbers is

318
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:10,050
you know you know it's been tried and
true for quite some time
