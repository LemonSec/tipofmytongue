1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
how close are you here unfortunately it
looks like the microphone was turned off

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,360
the battery ran out at the beginning of
this talk but you get to just a little

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,320
bit before two-minute mark R you will
like an inconvenience

4
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:17,950
ok so we want to talk about is how you
can use artificial intelligence in your

5
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:24,589
threat landscape one of things we
discuss is their recurrent neural

6
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,770
network so for anyone who is familiar
with different terms and machine

7
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,459
learning there's various neural networks
that can be set up and Steve you on talk

8
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,709
about what most people think of when
they think of computing and setting up a

9
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:51,590
network so with regards to neural
networks and machine learning the whole

10
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:59,100
idea is to basically mimic the synapses
that current human brain so with neural

11
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,390
networks and especially in the ones that
are being applied in InfoSec space it's

12
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,420
a it's a higher court type of system
where basically you have read it

13
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,440
information and it filters through the
different nodes just like a thought

14
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,500
process would filter through the human
brain in two different synapses so

15
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:25,290
depending on how much resources you have
one of the key components round no

16
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:33,299
networking and computing power so given
the advent of AWS Google Kirk grid

17
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:40,450
computing Microsoft Azure you have the
ability for companies nowadays as

18
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:46,630
opposed to stand up five thousand CPU
her five thousand servers in racks like

19
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:53,150
they used to back in 2000 early two
thousands you can instantly stand up in

20
00:03:53,150 --> 00:04:00,230
very very large neural network up an AWS
and be able to harness tech computing

21
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,619
power to be able to mimic larger and
larger neural net

22
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,890
works sort of things that happens within
the neural network when you look at the

23
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,750
bottom W in normal computing computer
what you wanna do it when we're all kids

24
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,988
you want to see your name + cross the
screen and then you got the output that

25
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:20,988
you wanted in or networks what's
actually happening

26
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:28,139
the norm network when you you give it a
huge sample set and then you tell it

27
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:33,270
what you think the alcohol and you help
it learn how to compute where you want

28
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,409
to go and it's constantly talking back
to itself so there's a generational side

29
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,340
of it as well as the learning from point
A to point B but then you also in a

30
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,780
layman's terms from point A to point Z
and it'll know everything in between two

31
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:53,820
mistakes were and how things move
forward from that so in the space and

32
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,900
everyone else has been making advances a
lot of us feel that we're kind of like

33
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,570
the guy right there is no cleanup on
aisle for there's a crypto variant

34
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,969
attacked us there's this fishing
campaign has come after us everything

35
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,669
that's happened so everyone's waved
white flags we bought more and more

36
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:17,270
tools and brought him into the in
instead of looking at ways to use

37
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,830
various technologies that are out there
in the market place to get away from

38
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:27,520
just a two-layer haitian throughout our
system so basically we gotta mop bucket

39
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,270
there we try to make it go faster with
more tools where we see this going is

40
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,639
everything that we've had before

41
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,770
AV hips sandbox in isolation EDR most of
these things are human involved right

42
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,500
you have to have someone writing seems
you have to have someone raincoat where

43
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,560
we see it going is where you're going to
get to only a guys involved where you do

44
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,250
not have to have the people involved the
computer is going to be smart enough to

45
00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:00,410
make the decisions for you with
artificial intelligence you can use the

46
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,729
power and machine learning to unlock the
DNA of advanced threats using those

47
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:12,190
shoes networks huge sample sizes you can
figure out is a file batters a good you

48
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,460
can train if something were to get
through and say this got through how to

49
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,638
get through

50
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:24,030
so how does this happen actually saw the
big key is 12 computing borrow that

51
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,979
larger networks like Amazon allowed us
to do but the next biggest keys the

52
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:34,729
sample set does anyone know over the
last seven days on virustotal homie

53
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,469
executables have been submitted

54
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:42,779
various pieces of our executables just
seven day running around and guess

55
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:51,819
what's at 7 million high number

56
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:59,189
1.9 1.9 million different pieces of
malicious executables lessons over seven

57
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:03,650
day period so the sample said that we
now have available to us is extremely

58
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,469
large so the key is you're able to train
the neural networks on these huge sample

59
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:14,279
says whereas before there wasn't
available to us to Steves gonna talk a

60
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:19,370
little bit about the extraction of that
information from the large sample sets

61
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:38,849
so as you feed into the neural network
trained neural network with knowing

62
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:39,849
where to look

63
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:46,770
initially so that's basically what's
called seed so starting with a neural

64
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:52,159
network would normally start with you
know couple thousand like 2500 seed

65
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:59,688
attributes that you would examine of the
file as it sits on examples of those are

66
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:06,860
the different first off let me show of
hands and have done now we're reversing

67
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:15,460
a couple people right so the idea behind
features one is a feature an attribute

68
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,030
is what are the different

69
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:25,710
linked components of an executable as it
sits on disk so executables they have to

70
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,960
follow some type of standard in order
for it to be executed by the OS correct

71
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,439
so this screenshot from PE studio is
something that you would just used to

72
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,640
examine file to determine whether or not
it's militias from a static analysis

73
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:49,720
perspective if you notice here it it
shows the PE header information that's

74
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,320
sorta like the table contents in a book
the different sections that are

75
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:02,010
contained within that executable
represent chapters danjus allocations

76
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:08,260
page numbers center including maybe
strength analysis what's contained

77
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,130
within the strings so all these
different types of things are attributes

78
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:19,790
that you can glean from a file as it
sits on this so during the initial

79
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:25,599
process of telling the machine how to
learn you're basically telling it where

80
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,490
to learn and as our reporter mentioned
earlier and I is a generational type of

81
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:40,170
approach so where you might start with
2,500 see that you eventually the

82
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,180
artificial intelligence neural network
will start to learn instruct to

83
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,739
extrapolate new features on its own and
that's how it's actually designed to do

84
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,610
this generation elites so where for
example you might start with 2,500 feet

85
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,680
attributes eventually you start hittin
millions and tens of millions of

86
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,750
attributes that a machine learning
neural network Ann gleaned from a file

87
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:13,150
in order to make that determination of
is this bad news is good luck guys

88
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,050
about the human brain and how it sort of
members in neural network when you think

89
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,609
about a baby and how they learn how they
grow you give the baby a ping pong ball

90
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:29,190
ball ball that's the only ball they've
ever seen their lives they take it they

91
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:34,520
drop initiative announced the very next
day you give that same baby and egg you

92
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,550
tell ball they're going to think it's a
ball they have no sample size nothing

93
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,819
now you take all of us in this room
probably blindfolded and handed hundreds

94
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,040
of different balls I'm just not feeling
it we know a tennis ball baseball

95
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,170
basketball whatever it might be

96
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,650
that's that's where that sample size and
then the ability to compute the

97
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,840
different kind of attributes of what
you're feeling when you're touching

98
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,810
works if you can visualize in neural
network said there's when we get into

99
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,369
how it works because there is everything
you can just see normally and a reversal

100
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,510
could see their structure features
second order features and third or

101
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,400
features in this gets into that deep
learning where once I would show the

102
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,090
connections back and forth with each
other so the third order can be talking

103
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,380
to the first-order talking to the second
order based on what's happening within

104
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:31,490
those orders it will derive information
so this is where it gets a little fuzzy

105
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,930
with regards to how to explain this case
when it comes to math basically a math

106
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,939
you start to answer mathematical
concepts so the third-order features are

107
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:48,280
derived from second and first quarters
features for example he may have you

108
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,810
know it's instead of just looking for
negative features you know things that

109
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,800
are indicating that it's bad you may
start to see combinations thereof

110
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,260
combined with absence of good features
that make up a whole new feature and

111
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,920
that's how we're able to grow from 2500
attributes or features at the machine

112
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:13,069
learning is examining to millions
because it's extrapolating and basically

113
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:18,370
deriving more features from as it learns
so when you once you get to the

114
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,380
third-order feature level here basically
started talking about mathematical

115
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,240
concepts such as detaining fluctuation
analysis mean change point

116
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,040
announced modeling and wavelet energy
decomposition now who here has never

117
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:44,520
heard of it terms so you get a door
prize ur so before starting his silence

118
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,459
I never heard a lot of these terms and
in reading some of that abstracts I

119
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,500
can't make it past two abstracts when it
comes to out of the white papers it's

120
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:00,990
been produced by David scientists around
how this actually good fits into our AI

121
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:08,990
approach but suffice to say it's it's
one of those things where being able to

122
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,890
apply these advanced mathematical
concepts to attributes in deriving more

123
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:23,250
features as a way to get more
granularity and more ability to whether

124
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:31,390
or not something delicious for her good
so here's some examples right view

125
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:40,380
station of the executable so how r
malware authors generating so much

126
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:47,760
malware out there well if I'm aware
author I stand up my infrastructure my

127
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,829
command control infrastructure and then
I create my ex my palos executables have

128
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:59,609
awaited deliver this sailors but the
crucial piece it I need to manipulate is

129
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:05,680
the payload itself so what's an easy way
to manipulate payload to basically reset

130
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,529
everybody today 0 when it comes to
examining what you know what's bad for

131
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:16,730
identifying once bed one way is to use
Packers Packers just basically a smart

132
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,230
compression utility tears apart
executable going back to you know the

133
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:26,089
sections of the excuse what we talked
about earlier in May and you know some

134
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:30,660
obfuscation techniques such as
compression encryption in certain areas

135
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,750
that would represent first-order
obfuscation

136
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,300
obfuscation techniques would be like
inserting dead code into the

137
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,520
different sections and then when you put
it back together it's fundamentally

138
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,740
changing how that actually looks to any
type of system that's actually examining

139
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:58,650
the files so the contribution to a guy
in that spaces using you know something

140
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:07,579
like structural and temperature and turn
into pre analysis which actually looks

141
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,480
at the different obfuscation techniques
and medoff Association techniques and

142
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:19,300
starts to draw conclusions based upon
the data identifies so for example

143
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,709
detection of packing

144
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:29,970
basically looking for patterns of
entropy change so as you you're starting

145
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:36,220
to introduce entropy and to the inside
of that file and then for example here

146
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,470
this is actually derived from one of our
data scientists white papers they're

147
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,140
able to drive Street irony seven
different mathematical features from

148
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:54,800
those types of medical education
techniques within a guy is just because

149
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,170
something is being packed we're trying
to show itself does not mean as

150
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,400
malicious right so you have to train on
that set to make sure that he

151
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,420
understands what is bad and what is good
is plenty of reasons for people to use

152
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:15,020
so you can have a I just triggering or
any other tool on anything he's back

153
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,880
making the bed so just go back to recap
the process of this is this represents

154
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:32,019
the process of training I'm sorry well

155
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:36,660
features are the features of the second-
and third-order creatures could be

156
00:16:36,660 --> 00:17:04,959
derived from what was just so as a
sample size grows in the model itself

157
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:18,339
becomes small amount of the 2014 general
elections tomorrow so just recap on AI

158
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,208
process here

159
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:24,399
collection just messin all these
different millions of samples extraction

160
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:28,458
of the features and the next is
transforming those features into

161
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:34,270
something numerical that can actually be
used so the transformation is basically

162
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:41,080
just sign in numbers to feature center
now how's that actually use was used to

163
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,129
derive different matrices that are used
for clustering and classification of

164
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:52,500
this features in relation to each other
so what

165
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:58,330
happens is you start to see different
features based upon the calculations in

166
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:03,460
the body of the numbers start to
actually kinda cluster together that

167
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:14,030
portion of the of the AI is basically
derives it derives a algorithm that is

168
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:20,810
used by whatever tool that you're going
to use to analyze the files so in a

169
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:27,780
nutshell all this process that we have
here is done under development there is

170
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:35,550
development of new products development
of the solution and then it is distilled

171
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:42,870
into an algorithm that his input on to
the ancient so the agent basically

172
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:50,360
contains as output of the machine
learning which is the algorithm that

173
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,459
it's used actually determine what's
what's been good so what does that mean

174
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:02,840
in practice means you look at the agent
can her solution can then look at the

175
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,919
edge of a file that sits on dis assigned
numerical values to the attributes did

176
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:14,920
it finds and then plugs as numbers into
that our them which is the output of the

177
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,070
artificial intelligence it's actually
produced during development so it

178
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,110
reduces

179
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:26,570
work from as opposed to a different
approaches where he would actually

180
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:33,750
compare list it actually reduces it to
mathematical process so as you plug

181
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,250
those numbers into the algorithm the
algorithm return to score in the new

182
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,960
make a determination of whether it's
better good based on the output it out

183
00:19:51,980 --> 00:20:01,190
model is 99.8% the false-positive rate
is point zero zero zero two percent and

184
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:07,549
it's very interesting not to get too
much but the will have someone would

185
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:11,700
consider a false positive we have one of
the guys I got a false positive here is

186
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,410
he was a visa vendor code is an update

187
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:20,250
signed by the vendor and so on the
backside of the people I would reach

188
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:27,660
around it should look at our someone who
better answer than that you will get on

189
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,950
the phone with them and WebEx and show
them the command control structure

190
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,260
here's what he's doing his work going

191
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,429
it went through all their trust models
right so they got it from the vendor it

192
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:41,360
was signed by the vendor went through
their various trust model they passed

193
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,340
out they took it back to the veteran
said what's going on the vendors I guess

194
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,320
we just realized that we were on we've
been delivering morse content out so the

195
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:57,939
fifty million attributes when CEO Stuart
McClure but suppose he talks all time

196
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,640
about you can try to be 250 million
attributes that's that's a non-starter

197
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,290
idea what people are going to try to do
is get credit on your network that's

198
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:12,918
what they're trying to do but from a
beating the engine which is highly

199
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:20,890
unlikely at this point in the last
picture here is another diagram of that

200
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:26,540
very simple wanted to beginning we're
depending on the output starts you can

201
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,570
see all the various connections that
could potentially possibly happen

202
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:36,090
always front to back and that's if you
think of every line in there as

203
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:42,510
attribute that's what you're saying only
that but this represents only a 1300

204
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:48,140
network so you can imagine connections
to start to deal with 10,000 neural

205
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,520
networks right so depend on how many
features a church traveling in groups of

206
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,190
features to dry cleaning and how much
computing power that you can actually

207
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,900
put to this amount of connections
between the different layers of the

208
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,490
neural network start

209
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,730
to grow incredible so with that we're
gonna show

210
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:57,879
especially VMware Fusion

211
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:12,539
so early in the fourth edition and is
getting updated about every six months

212
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:19,330
from the initial time product came out
but it is static we have people using

213
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,158
this product from the very first edition
and industrial control systems where

214
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:30,080
they've movie will air gas network who
never talks in the long run you can take

215
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,158
the original math models and he didn't
so its kinda when a new piece of our

216
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,940
comes out lockheed whatever my class
right whatever might come out there

217
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,529
running against the old math miles to
watch the fact that is so you're looking

218
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:47,119
at a map mile from eighteen months ago
to a piece of our know that everyone is

219
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:58,320
having problems with today so it's kind
of cool to watch all things go right so

220
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,769
little bit about the environment here

221
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:07,659
MacBook Pro dedicated to this connected
to my MiFi CITIC danger live our don't

222
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:17,639
connect to it so I have two machines
that I have here one has an effect upon

223
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:23,979
write to disk that's dark green one and
then the green one is actually highlight

224
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,350
and execution control so before it's
going to do the examination before it

225
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:35,769
slammed XQ both cities are completely
disconnected from the network so as an

226
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:40,340
offline man meaning there's no
connection to the Internet

227
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:48,970
there's no reliance on some type of call
back I do this to isolate the agent so

228
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:54,239
we can actually examined agents
functionality by itself so the first

229
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:57,239
thing we do the rumor two

230
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:09,260
ok so we're take samples grading over
here and we might drag some others well

231
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:21,660
so she just a little bit about this dude
represent numbering over here try to

232
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:56,430
execute him so here I downloaded this
morning and I used a packer to create

233
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:02,160
mutations said basically he's a repacked
they were pulled down from a public

234
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:08,190
repository so basically starting with
something that everybody knew about and

235
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,930
I used the same technique that malware
authors used would be repacked he's

236
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:21,170
basically said if we take a look at the
at these names of murder shot 256 so

237
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:33,880
taking this one the name

238
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:40,100
pains you know the regional 256 256 this
is the pact

239
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:48,530
256 working so all these are just
basically uses an hour so we're gonna

240
00:26:48,530 --> 00:27:02,230
open command process here and so just to
reiterate this is reliant on the output

241
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:07,250
of artificial intelligence neural
network these haven't been seen before

242
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,930
by the system there's no you know it was
actually pushed out or nothing like that

243
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:19,050
and is going to before execution
execution extract those features are

244
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:24,100
talking about sign numerical values
plummeted algorithm and then returned to

245
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:35,580
score based on the score to find a good
or bad right now so we're seeing access

246
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:41,360
denied from the from the main line
because basically when is trying to

247
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,639
execute ease and as is trying to excuse
you know just the agents actually

248
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,820
causing an execution and you know you
see basically things have been

249
00:27:51,820 --> 00:28:00,240
quarantined based fund algorithmic
examination of the files any questions

250
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:14,920
about the sofa go back over here and now
she noticed some of these well there's

251
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:21,600
mutations that where were their workers
and their rights is not what I wanted

252
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:35,830
this is actually was voted to completely
various

253
00:28:50,169 --> 00:29:04,390
so great question I'll get back to this
so we have some good sales here that are

254
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:15,020
packed right wondering is it so

255
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:22,220
internal tools I use vampire track to
pack these so basically if you can see

256
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,340
this but the size is completely
different rights

257
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:33,408
basically a new version of prop mom says
i click on this it's allowing it to run

258
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:39,480
because it's looking past affected his
hat and looking at the underlying

259
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,460
attributes and determine that it is so
that's the same same system saying

260
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:55,630
policy is just in this case file was
good and it was so going back to what I

261
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:02,580
was saying about this piece here this
was examined files a written to disk

262
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:10,110
warning load fast for my what i was
gonna point out but let's say let's say

263
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:25,320
something happens and you know it set
the salmon upon write to disk you get in

264
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:31,240
here and before actually able to examine
you actually try to click on it right

265
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,549
cities have been courting cute and takes
a little bit high but when I try to

266
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:41,940
execute its still moving it back its
movement to get top priority that point

267
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:50,659
relying on execution so there's one
watching for new files running out if it

268
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:54,740
doesn't do it fast enough and someone
tries to executed for the backstop of

269
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:02,519
execution so before it is allowed to
execute was able to do the analysis now

270
00:31:26,650 --> 00:32:00,130
some using Adobe Reader nine something
which I wanna ball was in your screen

271
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:21,560
resolution issued to unplug so I can set
my lawyer and do something on one

272
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:29,409
microsoft office student doesn't great
great that we don't have an activated

273
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,410
version of austen's

274
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:59,300
now this task manager here we take a
look at the process was so the PDFs is

275
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:10,090
actually a weaponized PDF and what's
going to happen when I click this is

276
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,810
because it PDF file extension is
associated with a card reader will see a

277
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:20,649
courier launched over here when the and
into PDF Creator will start to read in

278
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:26,540
content when it hits the portion of the
content that contains the next we'll see

279
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:35,810
a date in step and block it and actually
terminator soldiers are a courier is

280
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:44,240
trying to read content when it hits the
portion of content contains exploit in

281
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:53,410
this case it was a stack pivot agent
detected that said no no I know when

282
00:33:53,410 --> 00:34:02,750
those doc format right what happens a
lot of times when Melissa stop being the

283
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:13,389
scripts scripting attacks within a macro
this one as a little bit social

284
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:17,730
engineering says basically a constant
slot for security please enable macros

285
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:23,679
to view the content says I enable this
is gonna try to launch a script and

286
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,580
we'll see a pop-up and kind of go away
because their agents able to detect it

287
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:38,500
it's a script in saudi

288
00:34:38,500 --> 00:35:17,010
face a different type of explosion
typically learning process basically we

289
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:21,100
see that silence that artificial
intelligence is going to have a ton of

290
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:28,779
uses uses an InfoSec from specially
passwords credentials network uses and

291
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,940
because of the power of the sample size
are we now have the power of the car

292
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,200
that's there for us but it's gonna make
leaps and bounds for everyone in the

293
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,509
InfoSec community on stopping malicious
actors throughout the world that's cool

294
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:52,240
to see a I used a network spaces welders
actually what wonder there's a couple

295
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,779
different vendors that are actually
using a high on the networks basis well

296
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,740
so I'd be interested as a security he
would be interested in CA I start to be

297
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,700
applied in the same space maybe or you
know

298
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:12,960
credentials management space there's a
lot of power that can be leveraged

299
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,730
across not just uniform hours so you
know as being one of the first hopefully

300
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:23,430
you know we start to see it in other
portions of the community

301
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:44,960
yes we are a Microsoft AV if you go to
Microsoft's website where Microsoft

302
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,979
approve a V so you can remove us from
that side of it we have PCI and HIPAA

303
00:36:50,979 --> 00:37:20,489
various certifications from various
destinations so we can agree on my phone

304
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:24,039
so you don't want going to a customer he
say they have to do it this way you know

305
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:29,160
what time is it can do this when we've
had multiple QoS A's approve us as a

306
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,649
navy and approve us to replace their
current TV's

307
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:54,619
stations from those various
consultancies you can you put in some

308
00:37:54,619 --> 00:38:00,829
exceptions in your car Navy and that
allow us to run at first when we first

309
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:05,910
came out two years ago no one cared and
then now there's been some problems were

310
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,239
no try to kill us as a process more out
there so put an exception to make sure

311
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,950
that we can write it goes from there

312
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:19,229
Windows 10 for any old west run any AV
hooks into it it shuts off defender

313
00:38:19,229 --> 00:38:26,089
we've now work with Microsoft we've got
around that we can easily trigger flag

314
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:29,200
that doesn't register US Navy's defender
and

315
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:57,150
first the first round of funding which
costs $59 sure to talk about the very

316
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:43,809
first check around check dams on
whatever we have a disconnected mode

317
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:46,150
where you can actually

318
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,230
policy with with the executable speakin
evidence here

319
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:55,269
segregation and it can run completely
autonomous power connection really only

320
00:39:55,269 --> 00:40:05,930
required for event management and
hostile policy questions you know very

321
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:15,480
question I don't know I think it may be
a bit of a no I don't think it's a

322
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,480
secret I think I just don't know

323
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:45,420
if you look at the process here it's
usually around between 40 and 50

324
00:40:45,420 --> 00:41:01,309
normally this one is hot right now but
it's because 13032 even when I'm running

325
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:07,709
malware against it and never really see
it up above begging with 100 pieces of

326
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:10,709
our now though not supported

327
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:32,580
platform support you know requirements
if you have a specific need for custom

328
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:38,720
hardware on that we've done that
companies through basically

329
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:48,240
co-development I can say what you can
sit with aircraft something here what

330
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:58,700
basically coordinates to a linux-based
system that side aircraft for the

331
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:06,089
communications passengers so you know

332
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:18,230
development right again if it's if it's
one of the supported platform systems

333
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:24,050
supported platforms and systems
including embedded systems there is no

334
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:31,080
issue if it's something you need
possibly we could do it you know there's

335
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:38,620
enough money that's I didn't want to be
so crass a checkbook is but yeah it

336
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:50,410
depends on the type of skates power
electric gets that way to nuclear things

337
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:55,879
that had burst subsistence there's our
first medical places that are looking at

338
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,890
them have put it on their medical
devices the Internet of Things is gonna

339
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:19,580
be really interesting face cuz it is
pretty easy

340
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:33,240
so let's just take a look at it doesn't
make him a thirty-minute yeah we go back

341
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,919
to what the generals and as far as to
cloud management on demand service

342
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,920
centers domain

343
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:49,240
thanks
