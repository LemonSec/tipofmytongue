happening as far as transit security

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,940
what works what doesn't all that good
stuff so little bit of introduction this

10
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,559
used to be mean I was a big guy in fact

11
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:57,890
Katie Couric show and they they had
Benedict Cumberbatch who that is actor

12
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:03,239

played a couple movies anyways he was

13
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,100
coming up next on the Katie Couric show
and they said you know he coming up next

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,860
one of the world's sexiest men alive and
it had my face looking like that right

15
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,930
and they remove the up next piece for a
sec like a split second of course I'm a

16
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,820
hacker but is it you know Photoshop turn
in front of the screen is setting up the

17
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,610
world's sexiest man alive and had a
picture of me know that will work on my

18
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:28,170
face but I've lost a little weight since
then I've 225 pounds since that so it's

19
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,170
going great yeah Thnkx

20
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,850
my history one of the founders of Derby
Conn I wrote the social engineering

21
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:42,449
toolkit I testify in front of Congress
twice on never do that again i'm on the

22
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,360
news quite a bit in fact I was actually
supposed to be on CNBC here in Columbus

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,909
but I unfortunately don't have enough my
test was hard to get to the place to

24
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:56,380
start the charge but anyways I've been a
lot of different news organizations and

25
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,880
I started two companies one was trust
that's accurate information security

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,560
consulting company in Cleveland in a
binary defense systems which is a

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,670
twenty-four seven minor txt company but
I was a marine always a Marine

28
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,230
but I was in the signals intelligence I
got to do on the intelligence had

29
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,369
deployed twice to Iraq and a bunch of
other things I what's funny about that

30
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,790
the media stuff is like you know when
you when you start to do media for the

31
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,329
first time you're going on to a news
organization in a quick side and get

32
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,440
stuck in second but we know the media
did I was really always nervous like

33
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,880
what happens if a question on this I
don't know this topic concern over

34
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,030
prepare you know you're going on and I
would be sweating and super nervous not

35
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,120
like it's tough right now it is I walk
in jeans and a t-shirt on a little

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,390
secret on said I look like a
professional and even know what you're

37
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,119
talking about a lot of cases right and i
know im talking about but I don't know

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,400
over-prepared a lot of cases and so it's
interesting as I am very comfortable

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,910
doing these types of things now and a
month and a half ago two months ago I

40
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:06,150
was going on a news I won't say which
news organization it was but I was going

41
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,769
on this news organization and i sat down
and spoke to be talking about during

42
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:14,140
hacker stuff that's going on so you know
Aaron hackers you know taking on a dam

43
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,420
and also stopped right in so I sit down
schools to be an Iranian cyber expert on

44
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,600
you know Packers intruding into our
critical infrastructure and I sit down

45
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,040
and like a five minute to go live when
you're in front of the news are you get

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,320
a camera screen you don't see anything
that's going on in TV or anything like

47
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,769
that right and so they introduced me
like a like to introduce David Kennedy

48
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,410
is an Iranian nuclear expert in saudi
when you think about the treaty 1942

49
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:44,420
nuclear moments where you just like have
no idea what to do right I started

50
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,040
sweating in places I never knew I could
swear before and seeing a split decision

51
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,190
yet about a half a second of awkwardness
on TV the figure 88 I try to BS my way

52
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,940
out of some Treaty of 1819 to whatever
or or do you try to frame it to

53
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,310
something that you know about and so I'm
like I'm at right combination of both

54
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,160
try to BS this a little bit and I'm
gonna try to get to the cyber stuff

55
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,810
right so yeah yeah that cyber stuff
that's going on in like oh yes I'm like

56
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,358
yeah but the cyber stuff in the event it
was bad but luckily there was no

57
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,479
historical evidence and then no one

58
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,700
actually seen that video which has been
great but the crazy things that you can

59
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,909
run into that brings me to my topic
today which is what we're seeing today

60
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,710
in this industry and in what kind of
happening I think there's a lot of

61
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,940
positives I think there's a lot of great
things that we're doing it back the fact

62
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,630
that that this conference grows and was
double every year or not more is is a

63
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,540
testament to this industry growing and
how was growing in the things that are

64
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,060
happening so we're doing a lot of great
things but we face is really a global

65
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,990
problem is something that impacts
everybody in it doesn't matter what

66
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,830
industry vertical it is it everything
right everything from critical

67
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,020
infrastructure to reach on credit cards
to you you know trade secrets we all

68
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,299
know the whole stick on what we're
trying to protect and every company's

69
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,730
completely different but this is a
global problem that we face a lot of

70
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,150
things that are happening right now that
are the same thing that happened ten

71
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,510
years ago just in different capacities
are different types in so I talked today

72
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,990
is is to look at is a combination of one
how are the bridges that we're seeing

73
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,620
today still continuing to happen to you
know what we do to actually make that

74
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,630
better and three what does it mean
around the products that we see today

75
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,969
are trying to protect our infrastructure
against these technologies are on the

76
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,410
right and so head on all this is kind of
part of the stock today so that question

77
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,290
is how r reaches happening the second
one is why are we here today talking

78
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:40,830
about this specific topic or why people
even paying attention and soft focus

79
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,419
focus on the first topic which is
harvard is happening and if you look at

80
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,580
you look at how breaches are typically
having today I'll see little statistic

81
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,590
that we did from our customers I'm
specific breaches that they've

82
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,840
experienced in the past but what's
interesting is that the techniques

83
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,109
really haven't changed its still
promoter exploitation is still end user

84
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,210
compromise is still you know
spearfishing I love hearing about is how

85
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,229
sophisticated attacks are happening
right here the word sophisticated is the

86
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,290
same stuff that we're doing ten years
ago but if your target is now

87
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,110
sophisticated it can be from a kid in
high school

88
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,110
from China but your sophisticated
because it was targeted and so the same

89
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,780
types of matters right I I sent an email
to click a link or get through some sort

90
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,780
of San boxing stuff that you have in
front

91
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,969
on may click the link and a compromise
machine now their backs your internet

92
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,360
working in a move from their right to
move laterally environment and they go

93
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,270
to a system where they find on your own
side or unemployed us something with a

94
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,039
download a father this should happen now
you're stuck with ransomware whatever

95
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,410
you give him a dry docks whatever's
happening either and you have all these

96
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,680
different components that make up our
risks that we have not talked about that

97
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,290
the phishing site is always fun because
that's the easiest rate for me fishing

98
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,500
is one of those things that is a high
return on investment takes about a day

99
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,730
really really build a really good attack
against an infrastructure an

100
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,470
organization or company will keep people
in the organization I want to go after

101
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,669
those are the people that you you
typically go up like going for like

102
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:10,400
sales people use this line many times
but sales people are awesome as you can

103
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,310
tell it like a man I'm gonna hacker
computer but you know I'm gonna buy your

104
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,690
product can you just click this link and
receive but I still wanna buy from you

105
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,780
afterwards

106
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:27,349
ok cool never saw sales people are great
marketing fantastic you know those those

107
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,450
designations it's just there folks that
are necessarily are traditionally been

108
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,930
been text books that have been working
there for long tenure I like going after

109
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,200
folks that are certain age demographics
because a lot of cases or less

110
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,010
tech-savvy and that's horrible
stereotype but I have higher success

111
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,830
probability with that right I'm seeking
facts so you know certain people that

112
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,030
would target an organization that I have
a higher success rate going out and

113
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,099
usually takes me to actually find
somebody targeting takes like 20 minutes

114
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,930
right to build something that's super
cool and easy to use a good day of my

115
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,890
time and I thought I get access to
computers I'm gonna show you this is

116
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:08,990
that it CNN and they interviewed me in
Vegas for a duck on last year and the

117
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,760
news anchors Laura C you know if you
ever watched she's phenomenal she's one

118
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,770
of the best news anchors researchers for
CNN and she interviewed me she's like

119
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,640
hey I want you to hack into a company
might go to prison after if that happens

120
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,750
I can assimilate that she's like well
that's cool but as we show the real

121
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,710
stuff like a good idea call one of my
customers that I got a good relationship

122
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,328
with him I said hey I'll call Bob

123
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:37,198
then I wanna get that the company in
trouble for my kpop can I know can you

124
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:38,118
feel me

125
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:42,549
hacking into your company is a free pen
test basically and then you know make

126
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,829
sure that your name isn't in any of the
articles I guess that's cool

127
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:50,429
ok sweet so how can the company and so
we wanted me to see what I could do

128
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:57,139
hacking into a lot companies so here's
the the segments some creepy dude no

129
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:02,139
basement well that's a misconception
what if I told you there's a class 2

130
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:06,790
don't just get more social intelligence
than anyone

131
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:12,790
David kennedy's one of these was known
as a social engineer or a people had his

132
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,889
practice to dupe you into doing things
and sharing information you probably

133
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:22,749
should not funny story there's two
pieces of Simon the only contacted for

134
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:27,179
this one but laura's I can watch it
happen my boss is fine and so you know

135
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:29,850
first thing I did as I looked at his
social media presence in it he was

136
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,600
saying something like hey I'm in you
know France right now covering the story

137
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,419
right and so I'm like ok he's traveling
internationally grapes right so I call

138
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,869
me up and I spoke by phone number coming
from another number so little more

139
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:45,910
believable special international terms
and I said hey began as an example and

140
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,309
bobs in here and talk about him so I'm
picking on him but he's always click

141
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:59,059
things made it is so bob and I called
bob my case you know this is a stone's

142
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:04,259
throw from know I was just a fake bank
it wasn't a specific thing on his own so

143
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,889
from Chase credit card fraud services
departments i just want to see are you

144
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:12,579
traveling internationally now and you
know one adjustable credibility right

145
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:17,299
nobody's traveling public said it and so
he says yes I am and i'm ok that makes

146
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:21,709
sense for these charges that receipt
that's really you know me so did you buy

147
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:22,439
you know this

148
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:28,160
$370 at an adult store here in Germany
and they give me like bondage gear and

149
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,259
others are separate horrible horrible
things right that no one should ever be

150
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:33,459
buying that put him in an embarrassing
situation

151
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:37,248
is embarrassing right and and it puts us
out of our comfort zone and so like you

152
00:10:37,249 --> 00:10:40,689
get shocked all of a sudden and what's
interesting with that type of technique

153
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:46,069
is that certain things that you normally
would try to challenge somebody else if

154
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:49,290
I'm starting to ask you for sensitive
information you're most likely not gonna

155
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,050
provided however if you're in an
embarrassing situation you know you want

156
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,589
that embarrassing situation to be over
with so there's different techniques you

157
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,420
can use with social engineering and this
one was very effective I don't like to

158
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,579
use all time but I I kinda did you know
that the CNN color and so they're all

159
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:08,089
laughing in the background right of
center going to happen but you know so

160
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:13,029
you know he's like no no I don't like it
happens all time traveling in asking

161
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:15,579
don't worry kind of go over some of
those charged with you and I started

162
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:23,959
making them worse and worse and worse
and you don't don't sweat it bobbie no

163
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:27,819
no we're gonna reimburse the money you
have in your account by tonight's on you

164
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:30,790
know we had to go to the charges see
which one and where you staying when you

165
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,779
returning

166
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:36,610
ok great so I can I just need to verify
three things of a personal mission to

167
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,429
make her birthday is this I found that
it will have a time I need to repeat

168
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:44,569
number tells musical security number I
can you give your full full credit card

169
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,899
number this impact in order to verify
the full credit card and a sort of like

170
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:51,720
asking ridiculous stuff right you know
what your wife social security numbers

171
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,639
he's a whiny deposition transcript you
know only guy that knows is why I don't

172
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:05,569
mind at all seriously just asked me if I
know is gone already I think about like

173
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:11,498
like cats and stuff so it was very
successful me that that that PC sales

174
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:17,959
and I had a credit card numbers let me
ask you know it's great so easy ways

175
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,239
kind kind of people in the same things
I'm using illegal activity

176
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,230
David Gates companies to find out if
employees are leading the company

177
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,939
vulnerable he and his team shows how
it's done

178
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:32,449
step one of his number so it looks like
calling from inside the company and then

179
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:33,910
call tech support

180
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:41,279
hello I was wondering if you cannot take
a look at a website trying to get to you

181
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,860
its for a big customer think I'm working
on for Monday and I can't seem to get

182
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:50,519
the website for my computer and i really
appreciate the help I mean that could be

183
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,319
a stupid thing I'm I'm I'm really super
computers but not interesting enough

184
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:56,399
with this one

185
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,730
there are certain things that when you
call helped us you don't wanna go for

186
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,980
like ready I want to reset your password
I don't want to try to do things it's

187
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,920
gonna require challenge questions
questions aside do my homework and

188
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,559
trying to figure out what I'm doing is
trying to do something

189
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,899
things in this organization's combine it
doesn't require me to verify Who I am as

190
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:18,850
an employee I leave my phone number look
like I'm coming from the company's

191
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,670
software so if that person was looking
at that the caller ID so they would look

192
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,370
like I'm coming from the corporation in
this case I'm trying to do things are

193
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,490
gonna specific are challenging resetting
passwords no gayness sensitive

194
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,800
information he gets a website he might
go check it really quick get that out so

195
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:45,079
it's it's it's it's WWW dot survey that
asked you are why dash pro dot com

196
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:53,258
here's what the eighty guy doesn't
realize by clicking that link he's just

197
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:57,800
given David full access to computer just
sitting there watching this is a good

198
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,819
working fine now

199
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:03,870
awesome I know he did man I really
appreciate the help that was it

200
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,270
on a computer now you are able to take
take over this this guy is here with

201
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:16,140
then I would like under 200 minutes the
entire computer and think of it as not

202
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,750
just as computer but in this case the
company was paying David to have them if

203
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,100
their employees before they did so it
was a good example of how easy it is to

204
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,710
go for something that works pretty
consistent for us and most things we do

205
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:35,820
that social engineering and high return
on investment for us to get into it and

206
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,180
think about it as you know you're coming
from this from a law does one computer

207
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,280
matter I want computers literally
typically the downfall of entire

208
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,329
organization because now I have an
established command control here that

209
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,670
one machine now I moved to other
machines to get access the data that I

210
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,920
want you so I'll take information on
that machine whether it's local minister

211
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,280
accounts are no cash credentials or you
know permissions that they have access

212
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,970
to certain systems move to other systems
to get access that type of data so it's

213
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,450
really a down-home that it was great as
you know there this company has a great

214
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,620
security program and all the tools you
can possibly imagine application

215
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,130
whitelisting intrusion prevention
systems and sandbox relations right and

216
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,890
none of us were detected anything that's
that's a shame right but we'll talk

217
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:25,210
about the big one now is is ransomware a
what's interesting about ransomware is

218
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,000
that you know as part of of security
typical you have some sort of component

219
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,680
of disaster recovery and business
continuity right and so PCP Dr kind of

220
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,599
phones and cases especially from ninety
perspective

221
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,160
security has a pretty big helping hand I
now have financial institutions

222
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,449
healthcare organization everything you
can possibly imagine trying to build

223
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,230
ransomware incident response procedures

224
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,520
its response procedures are making sure
that we are going to pay the ransom when

225
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,240
it happens

226
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,800
in a ridiculous like a we need to make
sure that we go through the whole

227
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:03,010
Bitcoin process that when we get it when
we get there we can pay the Bighorn

228
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:09,050
immediately to get our files back like
really hope never never mind just i cant

229
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,300
even right now I just gotta take a break
and go get a coffee from Starbucks

230
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,529
weather but here's an interesting when I
did on on on CBS now it's funny but the

231
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:21,750
story when I was going to CBS I was
literally in the middle of nowhere in

232
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,320
the middle of nowhere in and in Atlanta
and places in atlanta that there there's

233
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,670
like it's like I've never seen anything
like this in my life right and so they

234
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,740
call me like a can you go to our one of
our affiliate station down the road and

235
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,050
it's like twelve 12 1 o'clock at night
to be discussed during the next morning

236
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,349
6:06 a.m. and so you got a car they
bring me to this place and I'm literally

237
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,690
in this tiny like new broadcasting
location and was like the most humble

238
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,149
situation cuz I had a talk to a person I
gotta look at a person just stare at

239
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:52,959
them it was talking to somebody on the
phone and that's such a weird dynamic

240
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,560
when you actually have to do a three way
talking actually talking to somebody

241
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,640
some a little awkward with no sleep
whatsoever but this is on ransomware

242
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,389
miss this morning it paid nearly
seventeen thousand dollars in ransom to

243
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,309
hackers

244
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:11,569
the FBI is investigating the
cyberattacks just that disable the

245
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:16,470
computer network at the Hollywood
Presbyterian Medical Center car Evans is

246
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,730
at the hospital with the story behind
the ransom payment card a good morning

247
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:26,699
good morning the hospital says patient
care was not affected by the attack and

248
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,910
computer systems are up and running
again

249
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,140
authorities are now searching for these
hackers who were paid with Bitcoin

250
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,400
that's a digital currency that's nearly
impossible to trace and while the

251
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,270
hospital says it notified law
enforcement immediately we're now

252
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,639
learning that may not be the case in a
brazen attack hackers

253
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,780
Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in
a source familiar with the investigation

254
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:58,230
tells CBS News no hospital paid the
nearly $17,000 ransom to take back

255
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,620
control before contacting law
enforcement

256
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,260
it is statement the president of the
hospital said the quickest and most

257
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:10,309
efficient way to restore systems was to
pay the ransom if they decide to pay the

258
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:15,889
ransom it probably means that they
didn't have the data and the data would

259
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,370
have been lost that they didn't pay the
ransom on February fit so this one is a

260
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,429
lot of hospital now getting impacted by
and hospitals you know have a lot of

261
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,400
very sensitive systems and they don't
touch the systems and a lot of time

262
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,600
securities but it lacks in a lot of
different organizations that typically

263
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,969
running soon so this one was an
interesting one because actually pay the

264
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:41,020
ransom before contacting the Halo
universe operations less given 17 grand

265
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,240
cheaper than having to deal with backups
I guess so you know you know you know

266
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,390
being awesome service for these these
these folks like once they do it and you

267
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,770
get the 17 Grand they help you say
you're gonna fight by other other

268
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,650
ransomware you know scams that but only
other rights affecting once a year but

269
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,300
will guarantee you that you can get
impacted by anybody else that's out

270
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,500
there i think is good business model

271
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,860
this is the last thing this is a good
one

272
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,949
what's funny is a lot since you get
thrown a lot of curveballs I had one

273
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,450
like hey tell me about what how how we
can disrupt my sister I know nothing

274
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:25,980
about what the heck I know nothing about
you really yeah I mean if these are our

275
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,210
little bit off the wall question but
they're they're always pretty good this

276
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:35,530
one was good because it was the first
real the first real ransomware Mac day

277
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:40,340
has come where even Mac users over the
weekend

278
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,809
Apple customers were targeted by hackers
using software known as ransomware so

279
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:50,080
what is that ransomware is a type of
cyber threat that encrypts data on

280
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,050
infected computers and then hackers
usually ask users to pay a ransom to

281
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,970
release the key to their files and data
so what without ransom be well this time

282
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,990
the type of ransomware that was
specifically targeting users who

283
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,900
downloaded an updated version of
transmission which is used to transfer

284
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,060
my getting am I getting in the weeks
here it involves Bitcoin peer to peer

285
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:20,490
file sharing money hackers were asking
users to pay in this part right now

286
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,250
about worth about four hundred and
eleven dollars to get their computer

287
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:29,080
control we're open the door for other
hackers to attack more Mac users and

288
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,090
maybe iPhone users how will this impact
couples fight with the FBI when it comes

289
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,520
to hacking into the San Bernardino
shooters iPhone joining me now

290
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,590
white hat hacker and trusted SEC CEO
David Kennedy from all sides here up how

291
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:48,629
fixable as it should anybody be paying a
Bitcoin to any malware operator here

292
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:52,160
just to get their control back depends
on whether or not you want your files

293
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,429
back if you have good backups which we
have we recommend you know you don't

294
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:58,429
have to pay it but if you want to get
you know maybe photos are things you

295
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,540
would lose from this I mean hackers are
doing a good job and encrypting this so

296
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,770
I mean a lot of people do pay the ransom
companies paid a ransom had a hospital

297
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,990
paid about $14,000 to get the files back
that they had impacted by ransomware you

298
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,590
are kidding what if I don't even deal in
Bitcoin then there might not targeted

299
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:20,590
here 10 says the problem so big big
coins are the way they it's almost gone

300
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,750
traceable money and law enforcement is a
very difficult time and money goes to

301
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,429
and so you know they actually give you
step-by-step instructions on how you can

302
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:31,800
actually pay for bitcoins in fact
sometimes even have a twenty

303
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,370
hundred-numbers that you can call you
actually get a live person better

304
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:45,168
customer service we cannot them turn it
around and trace back I mean police do

305
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:49,840
it every day though the problem is that
ransomware isn't is now taking shape is

306
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,040
being one of the largest organized crime
/ businesses out there and they're

307
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,178
usually in the Eastern Europe places
that may have a lower law enforcement

308
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:01,160
capabilities and so you have these call
centres know that have hundreds of

309
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,550
hundred people working on these are
full-fledged businesses are making

310
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,800
millions and millions of dollars off
doing this ransomware I I know what's

311
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,740
interesting about that is we actually
did 14 company where they had a big one

312
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,360
issue and I called them

313
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,860
1 800 number and I'm telling their
friendly people like you immediately get

314
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,030
a person is no automation like we're
sorry we're taking your money but you

315
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,770
still have to pay the ransom you know I
know this is an inconvenience for you

316
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:33,460
it's amazing I thought I felt good
paying the big announced that he was a

317
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,460
really nice guy really nice guy

318
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,370
survey that I would take that first time
I had one to do the survey to actually

319
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:51,899
go in and do that right now they're
happening right we actually did a survey

320
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,790
for instant response customers that we
deal with on a daily basis so you know

321
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:00,460
we deal with its global companies so we
do work both United States as well as

322
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,700
kind of everywhere else and so we on
interference in response groups and i'm

323
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,680
looking a lot of causes and looking at a
lot of things and so here's the

324
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,350
statistics behind our data how many
people I remember what it was like

325
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:19,100
twenty seven different companies for 82%
happened due to end point compromise

326
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,280
initially the initial foothold in
western and comprises a very high

327
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,350
statistic on that means that the large
percentage of the highest risk factor

328
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,189
the you having organizations are your
points but I'm sure we all know are

329
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,120
coming to the realization or slowly
realizing that that's the issue 14

330
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,889
percent from a premier compromise
significantly down from five years ago

331
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,879
you look at five years ago we were
talking about sequins action in buffer

332
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,700
overflows and all that stuff on our
premier defenses and that's dropped off

333
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,560
you know we don't see even true
repentance perspective we don't

334
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,899
typically see the full compromises from
the outside happening a lot better job

335
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,240
insecurity or premise phenomenal
fantastic industry businesses for doing

336
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,880
that I think that's why you see a lot of
that percentage drop and i also think

337
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,350
that you know hackers realize it's much
easier to get to that point themselves

338
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,449
because you're using antiquated
technology on the points right

339
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:15,110
traditional things like antivirus where
we've known and the past 15 years right

340
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:21,919
right so you know those the types of
things that we have a lot of a lack of

341
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:29,080
visibility 4% employer I love employees
and it's not their fault its technology

342
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,320
right you mean you know they're not
supposed to be security experts you know

343
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,389
an end-run

344
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,730
security experts right so we have to
figure things out there to figure things

345
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,750
out a lot of cases on things like pass
reasons from one side to another like

346
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,240
using the same gmail password as you
know your your corporate password is the

347
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,870
way that they got in or you know he went
to Western $1 something around somewhere

348
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:52,639
right so you know employees were a small
percentage that 4% so a lot of those

349
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,540
employed compromises in the breaking
down or more and more spearfishing

350
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:01,139
things like that so why are we here and
why do we see that our highest risk

351
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:07,460
factors are really towards her and point
compromising compromise in our print and

352
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,340
so why are we at this position right
here today we're dealing with this as

353
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:16,030
army are our biggest factor in her
biggest issue and so like to do is kind

354
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,580
of go and take a step back and say ok
let's look at how InfoSec of all ok

355
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,990
because i think is important read today
to understand we came from this is my

356
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,900
perception ok I'm younger guys that
seems like it's getting pretty quickly

357
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,450
I'm losing more hair every day so I've
been in this industry now since I know I

358
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:38,440
think I started in like 99 years that's
still relatively new and comes so we

359
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,210
started with with with basic building
blocks and this is what I remember from

360
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,690
the nineties and then I remember much in
the nineties my high school friend but

361
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:51,030
you know you look at the nineties and
you know we we talked about security in

362
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:55,780
a way that was about building blocks
right hey have a firewall segment things

363
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,090
and move things into their own
compartments and things like that and

364
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:02,310
start to build your network in a certain
way that was a nineties keep it simple

365
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:07,500
as we were simple that time technology
was simple and so I K but but but listen

366
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,320
security is going to be a big deal she
was a hacker conference you know

367
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,240
starting out in Vegas called DEFCON and
in all these hackers are coming about in

368
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,170
hackers are going to be the next big
thing so we need to start building our

369
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:21,600
networks now right now in the nineties
right now to be able to withstand we're

370
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,730
going to see the future really good
visionaries and outside nobody listened

371
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:30,399
right and businesses move the way that
it didn't do investments we cried wolf

372
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:35,330
like a hackers are many comps are out
there trying to calm but they didn't

373
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:40,408
necessarily really do that because our
businesses are still working to get PCI

374
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:48,019
and PCI was a good or bad thing i think
is a good thing at the time because what

375
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:52,039
PC I did is it set a baseline of what
secures a lot of people built their

376
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:58,070
security programs in the ramifications
of that now but what PC I did it gave us

377
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:02,320
a way to say hey you have to do is a PCI
set so it's in our compliance program

378
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,299
now has funding and has money than ever
had before and we had to do that because

379
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:11,690
we have to comply with PCI but it still
is crying wolf hey we have to discuss

380
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,690
PCI says hackers going to britain saw
her credit card right on target happens

381
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,840
they're like hey let's not be the next
target right now is using crazy hey they

382
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,289
fired the CIO the CIO got like oh do you
want to be the next one right next

383
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:35,080
target market went crazy because of all
these different breaches are starting to

384
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,918
happen right this is fairly new no 34
years ago and so executives were

385
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:45,859
freaking out there like whoa hackers got
these cyber weapons

386
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:52,630
this is what they look like cyber
weapons right sophistication in apt and

387
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:57,670
all this other stuff is China its Russia
I ran the still in all more intellectual

388
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:07,010
property all this stuff the cyber
weapons looks like my favorite hackers

389
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:11,970
always know what happened that's how I
hackles and say got his sophisticated

390
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,820
hackers guide dog than anything that was
a preset related to something if you

391
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,909
were targeting any way shape or form the
stuff that I was doing high school now

392
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:23,540
has a program three lines of basher now
sophisticated hacker can use a command

393
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,670
line and you're not sophisticated hacker
download it from our website and a

394
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:32,550
consultant another organization are now
a sophisticated and this change the

395
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:37,560
market because now we had a release a
way of getting out of things and putting

396
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,270
liability and shift away from the
company for historically bad decisions

397
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:49,500
and so something awesome happened at
this point something really awesome we

398
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:56,970
got money finally we'll be talking about
for 10 years I don't have enough

399
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:03,300
staffing on a budget on this we got it
right we got people now we're trying to

400
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,940
give people a hard right but we got
money that's all we've always been

401
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:13,630
claimed I T spending fifty million
dollars and I have my my budget is my

402
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:20,490
salary right that changed history a cash
we got her wish that's what we're hoping

403
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,580
for to get the funding in the
recognition that we wanted to be able to

404
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,770
change program to look at the security
industry insiders security mark was

405
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:32,120
badass IV seven billion in 2015 an
estimated to grow 270 billion by 2020

406
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,429
many companies have doubled their
investments recent reports in the past

407
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:41,910
five years 1020 investments are made in
private security starts telling 7.3

408
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,330
billion

409
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:48,340
the big market right this is the hot
market right now to be in because we're

410
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,850
growing so much so now we got the money

411
00:29:52,940 --> 00:30:00,490
ok we got to my now we've been crying
wolf for ten years but now we have all

412
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,090
of this risk that we've had for 10 years
we've known about her ten years and we

413
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,649
have this money that's great but how do
you take that money and start to reduce

414
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:13,350
the risk of an organization that's the
toughest part about this and so now

415
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:19,050
we're like live on this work now I'm do
decide to do this paper and I've

416
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,730
compliance and regulatory I have risked
it all this issue as hackers is camp in

417
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,210
20 Dec got a passion I E

418
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,640
we didn't even use I am going to
understand all the stuff now you have to

419
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,640
buy off on but still ten years ago
blacks

420
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:42,090
this market so short and talents and so
wide but I got money I got money but you

421
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,760
sit there right

422
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:54,520
awkward around us we got a big big pile
of cash you don't know what the deal

423
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,200
with right but you gotta spend that
money can be done to like a not gonna

424
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,100
get that next year

425
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,040
gotta spend this money and so today as
we have a product error when the project

426
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,909
was born in so now you have been very
hot industry a lot of money and a lot of

427
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:15,920
solutions to actually fix the risk you
have your organization and so this

428
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,880
product coming out of every single facet
you can possibly imagine this is the

429
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,560
next hottest thing this stop serving
this is this is something we have cyber

430
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,210
robots that that that literally
destroying eliminate the hackers right

431
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,590
away don't want to ruin the whole thing
can be good but we have a April Fools

432
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:38,020
joke coming out in two days can be
hilarious we're releasing a new tool

433
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:43,360
that stops 100% of the attackers 100%
and we have this module error adding

434
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,409
it's called The Enforcer wing and it's
gonna be home movies get but literally

435
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,880
it's something that goes that the
hackers house and beat them up

436
00:31:48,880 --> 00:32:00,710
so that's how we protect your company so
what we saw now is that we have products

437
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,730
we having said that do all this great
stuff and then we look at them like will

438
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,870
have to buy that because I need to do
something because right now I have all

439
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,800
the stuff and I'm not people I need
products and so the focus start to

440
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:17,139
become technology over over town because
we need the new technology we were using

441
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,620
you know all essays and fixes that you
know we haven't touched in a few years

442
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:26,659
but stocks rationality ok I like that
make the throw little thing out here for

443
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:32,360
rational I don't understand it yet so
you have folks that are have been decent

444
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,360
at firewalls are awesome and firewalls
for the past 10 years and they know

445
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:44,030
Cisco so well but you need to go to
NextGen you have to talking about so you

446
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,100
gonna take those guys that have ten
years of institutional knowledge of

447
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,230
awesome work and you gonna happen to a
brand new technology and expect that the

448
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:56,070
work rates and what do you do you just
use the import tool to import almost 10

449
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,350
years of horrible work into that new
tool that you have now now you're next

450
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:08,540
gen right that's awesome I understand it
get it but technology and so you look at

451
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,770
where our area now there's investors
everywhere

452
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,600
calls every day trying to buy trust
that's a combined nine inches I like

453
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,750
having my own company and if I don't
grow then that's fine with me but you

454
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,390
have his series ABCDE finding where if
you don't you're not familiar with the

455
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:29,110
whole venture capitalists stuff will you
do when you have a good idea as you go

456
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,209
to investors sold Silicon Valley thing
right now okay I had an awesome idea oh

457
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,320
my gosh you have an idea yes
revolutionary gonna stop hackers

458
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:42,200
stopped dead in their tracks here's ten
million you gotta make something that's

459
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,150
what they call series a ten million
dollars in cash actually take that

460
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,000
within your brain and build a product
and so you going to buy a home

461
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,800
developers an awesome stuff you to
distinguish structure company building

462
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:00,370
now the $10 gone but you still have
Apple product you have a prototype in

463
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,879
1982 Series B funding

464
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,540
hey it's twenty million dollars who and
i got her some salespeople and some

465
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,020
mighty people to do this and do that at
school now my money ok so seriously

466
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,650
funny ok with a hundred million dollars
now going to market the hell out of this

467
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:20,080
thing I might not even work for the
market the hell I think it's gonna be

468
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,639
revolutionaries are people gonna buy has
a ton of cash and so that's the whole

469
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,600
thing in these companies are literally
dropping left and right they're dropping

470
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,909
because they can't sustain it if you get
a hundred million dollars you watch all

471
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:35,699
the controller company announced board
of directors also another at a point

472
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,469
where they had to continue to get more
money just to have money to keep the

473
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,449
company going

474
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:45,839
we're buying technology from then they
focus on negativity right the foodstuff

475
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,040
hey gotta go through negativity to sell
our products and so the whole market now

476
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,418
becomes about negative about how awful
we aren't security for Chinese have

477
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:57,390
penetrated every major corporation and
consequently the United States and is

478
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:02,690
taken from you should never ever we've
never ever not found Chinese Mauer ok

479
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:08,010
then you just had lines of just
negativity to me feel like the situation

480
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:14,390
is dire specialty allow that to be part
of your day today right we're getting

481
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,680
all time

482
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,290
situation's horrible dire need more
money we need more people we need this

483
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,990
and this

484
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:25,160
brands in general in this industry
consistently over user base tactics in

485
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:30,629
other words it gets certain agenda
pushed through next this nature even the

486
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,000
truth is truth is not that bad

487
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,930
we've come a long way from iran also has
a little bit this truth is we are

488
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:44,319
getting better and we're doing we
learned a lot in the past 20 years of

489
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,110
what we've done in the past and what
we're doing now my my favor

490
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:54,910
that I've I guess that i said i guess im
so egotistical but I like this guy ok 10

491
00:35:54,910 --> 00:36:00,279
years of neglect isn't fixed with one
year of investment you can't fix 10

492
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,640
years of neglect in one year

493
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,859
security is about taking what you can
take in based off of the time you have

494
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,050
the people that you have in a staffing
that you have to be able to do it and

495
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,310
bring it down in prioritizing hey what's
my highest risk right now what's the

496
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:18,400
mid-market look like and how I
prioritize my folks to be able to do

497
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,760
what I need to do this year knowing that
it's not going to be perfect then I will

498
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,590
never be perfect

499
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,610
you will never be perfect in this
industry just not possible techniques

500
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,890
are gonna change things are going to be
different you might say that the trend

501
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,390
right now nm points and tomorrow some
crazy things that hacks all through

502
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,700
their way you know right but what we
know right now is that our highest risk

503
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,370
for this is part of our company profile
and what I know now is that based on the

504
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:49,220
time investment that I have I can do
this we communicate that hey we have all

505
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,069
this risk here as all the rest of we
have heard from twenty years of just

506
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:56,540
doing bad security practices you don't
know about the exam invoke with you the

507
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,930
entire time and working here but how are
we are security right so let me take

508
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,040
this I'm gonna take it off and chunks in
this is gonna be our program for next

509
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,690
year's focus you can do that what's
interesting is that the visibility and

510
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:15,520
security is just now and I T isn't just
some CEO's aboard this is a study from

511
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,040
PwC forty percent of organizations that
were surveyed have the board percent in

512
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,590
our overall security strategy board
members are like her but softonic hey I

513
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,630
saw ransomware what you need to explain
to them why what ransomware is what the

514
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,710
coins are also learn stuff that's
awesome ranks visibility we never had

515
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,490
before and it's great that we've been
asking this question now it sucks when

516
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:42,720
they're trying to dictate strategy in
there necessarily understand the risks

517
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,660
of the organization but that board
record on the board of directors her I C

518
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,490
squared this break

519
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:53,970
how bored at work we all we are no idea
we're talking about I want to talk about

520
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,529
right but we all think we have a decent
idea and so hopefully we strategize and

521
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:01,010
do it a certain way that makes things
better but we will rely on experts gonna

522
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:06,820
do it for me we need prioritization not
product ideas on what I mean by that is

523
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,150
understanding that if I have a program
that isn't working the way need to you

524
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,780
but I have a program and I need to
augment our technology that's great and

525
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,100
testing and go do technology long you
can handle it but every time you

526
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,060
introduce a new piece of technology
introduced a brand new piece of

527
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,619
complexity and you already have enough
people and staffing us to handle we are

528
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:27,619
currently doing are you doing things
right in your area

529
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:31,490
need to buy another piece of technology
introduced more complexity into your

530
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,759
environment

531
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,380
and that's the difference we buy things
before we think we gonna do things in a

532
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,120
direction because it's myopic very small
as its to handle right now been on a

533
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:48,859
long-term very much so some statistics
here from NY what threats are challenges

534
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,610
are the greatest concern of you of
course sophisticated attacks targeted

535
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:56,750
and your organization rang the
sophisticated hacker start off fishing

536
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,400
social network exports and other forms
of social engineering what came in

537
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,860
largely seconds

538
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,380
accidental deletion and users who fail
to follow security policy was their

539
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,280
cases the three top concerning things
but to top ones by car are gonna be

540
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,810
sophisticated tax insulting their
exploits what we spend our time on now

541
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:20,720
that's twenty percent tax rate our
largest concern has been twenty percent

542
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,149
of the time

543
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:27,070
31% be spent on fishing social network
exploits and the third one that is a

544
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:33,830
little bit different here where should
focus our time on look at the 35 percent

545
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,420
is the highest security vulnerabilities
in judaism iPhone application

546
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,450
development internal mistakes or
external attacks that caused my

547
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:46,250
organization to lose compliance security
vulnerabilities introduce you to

548
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,470
purchase up off the shelves offer though
the three highest categories we spend

549
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:56,689
our time yet our biggest risks that we
know of other sophisticated attacks and

550
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:03,070
end users right we spend most of our
time fighting fires so what does work I

551
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,800
talked a lot about Hague we have a lot
of issues we deal with but we are

552
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,830
getting better what does work forces
that approach someone is it any

553
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:14,240
successful program in my opinion is the
approach that you take toward security

554
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,220
program I'll give you a couple little
bit to get some technical Nuggets reach

555
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:19,799
you at all

556
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,850
help stop people like me step one is the
approach what is your plan for action

557
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:27,819
reducing risk your company cuz we have
to still take a risk based approach is

558
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:32,910
no question that ok all mature and I was
one of those Mesa a troubled resting my

559
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:37,089
eyes I was a young kid hacking into
computer system as a whole dress nice

560
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,270
wanna break and computer system we have
to figure out a way to prioritize and

561
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,890
figure out that is in our company
there's no question about the first one

562
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:44,650
is approached

563
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,809
second is the basics we're not even
doing the fundamental basics as anybody

564
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:52,750
know today was my main method for
compromising and getting access to

565
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,720
things like domain controllers and
database things like that her my number

566
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:03,959
one way that a break in the end users
given right but after that when I get

567
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,059
into system how do I find other
exposures to get into the organization

568
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:07,760
was a number one wanted to do

569
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:16,289
default passwords that some crazy sexy
exploits and even if it is a mess 00 267

570
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:23,569
which was released in 2008 still in
companies today bTW have BBQ not good

571
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:29,730
right is the simple stop the basics its
you look at and I don't like using a lot

572
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,440
of the resonator bridge report stuff but
there are some good nuggets in there one

573
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,150
of them is that was something like like
99% of all breaches that occur from the

574
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,849
prior-year happened from ECB that was
two years or older that's ridiculous

575
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:49,690
absolutely ridiculous right doing
hashing and the hardening of our default

576
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:56,380
but you need this next on products the
basic stuff takes work it takes you

577
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,819
actually have to physically change
culture requires interaction break

578
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:03,720
things that impact the business it
happens I guess what you should clarify

579
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,450
that with your manager listen you guys
have been doing bad stuff for 10 years

580
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,569
in order to fix I'm probably gonna down
a couple things here and there gonna

581
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:16,640
happen at the same conversation was the
chief security officer Dibble and the

582
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,779
co2 time Wisconsin our ski and tom was
was someone I admire because he was one

583
00:42:21,779 --> 00:42:25,059
of those people that would listen to
people and make decisions based off of

584
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:29,539
their expertise that's phenomenal you
have a leader like that right and I said

585
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:34,049
that I like Tom you guys just decide to
stop passion for two years because it

586
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:39,299
didn't want to impact the business that
I guess so in order for me to fix a

587
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:42,099
braking whatever you want

588
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:48,069
before her phrase actually get my phone
re to break that you'd like but do it in

589
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:52,579
a way that makes us better and so we we
had issues we had things why I was doing

590
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:57,799
assessment I wanna applications and I N
double ACP injection accidentally why

591
00:42:57,799 --> 00:43:00,180
did I made a true statement I don't
forget password reset and reset

592
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,729
everybody's passion completely in in our
entire customer database which is a

593
00:43:03,729 --> 00:43:09,399
nightmare and you get a car i care you
must this application like maybe you

594
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,749
know you wanna admit that regulators

595
00:43:12,749 --> 00:43:19,979
fired you know mr Gee security officer
for a fortune 1000 company they have you

596
00:43:19,979 --> 00:43:24,229
know meetings every week about you know
like top threat to stop again you're the

597
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:28,058
top prep for the organization every week
you like you you wear the badge of pride

598
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:32,680
because the slack in her hair and so the
whole thing was trying to get to know

599
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,029
the bigger threat they like but the
basic stuff that really is the big deal

600
00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:40,789
but it requires you to break things but
that should be communicated listen to

601
00:43:40,789 --> 00:43:44,539
change things I gotta do some drastic
stock picks were a bit gotta fix a

602
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:47,499
manager gotta fix our application
security our application coating

603
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:52,738
processes are still see a lot of things
we have to do to fix the basics her me

604
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:58,839
missus been through my whole life is a
value people first over anything else I

605
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:02,640
believe that people make a good decision
on something versus a piece of

606
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,509
technology value people over technology
any day

607
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:09,059
the problem in corporations those
headcount in people's when the most

608
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:13,160
difficult things to get right getting
people in most organizations is very

609
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,109
tough see how to figure that out the
people are gonna

610
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:21,730
maker breaker program people who rely
off there's no way that I as a person

611
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,460
can run two companies I didn't have the
people with me to be able to run those

612
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:31,390
companies they do anything to make fun
of them do means every once in a while

613
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:38,230
but aside from that so you have people
as your core of what you do and that has

614
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:45,580
to be Partner Program get good people
for his visibility visibility is such an

615
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,880
ambiguous term because we went with Sims
Sims where they're going to be this a

616
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:55,240
ballgame visibility we had it was easy
because we said we can deploy these

617
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,149
multimillion dollar server
infrastructures and anything else we can

618
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,340
get this blog and also stopping Senate
central here now we have visibility

619
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:06,050
environment right and its impact us so
it's kind of securities way of finally

620
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:10,020
getting to a point where we can have
visibility promise you have so much data

621
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,530
you have no idea to do with it

622
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:17,180
no ideas and I'll just use cases for
compliance like this for PCI we might

623
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:21,529
have a couple of cool video he pulls IP
addresses from and then use the default

624
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,310
content of this is going to be great
right

625
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:27,830
the time the time that it takes to
actually build in a good understanding

626
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,819
of what's happening requires you
actually understand those applications

627
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:35,570
ok this application does this in this is
normal track this is not normal you have

628
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:38,780
to go to an application due to figure
that out the work with the application

629
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,600
to do things not just sent all this I am
can indeed it back to the Senate office

630
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,640
and you're gonna get it so visibility to
me is not just getting information what

631
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,859
you do with that information getting
visibility was great as they have the

632
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,450
same infrastructure that's awesome you
have a great summer edition we doing for

633
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,450
your points we don't we don't look
around once ok

634
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:10,540
points biggest risk of not looking that
far

635
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:18,259
stop buying stuff okay just for a little
to stop buying stuff you don't need to

636
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,050
buy anything we know you're good we're
at the stuff that you have a perfectly

637
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:25,350
fine you need to make a multi-million
investment to face something out that

638
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:29,610
you already have the people and
expertise in going doing well as my five

639
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:33,920
steps that are important to protect what
can you do right now there's some things

640
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,410
that I like to put into my slides that
are things that I I attest to that make

641
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,589
it much more difficult for me as an
attacker

642
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:45,370
these small things are in place it
really makes my life though it does so

643
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:49,870
first one is a randomizer disabled local
local admin accounts local admin account

644
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:54,100
on servers and workstations you know you
may get some feedback and dialog with

645
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,310
the local admin account you know if the
computer gets destroyed from the domain

646
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:01,710
what you reboot in safe mode renamo's
that counts there goes that argument so

647
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:05,210
you have the ability to see below the
same get rid of them you don't need

648
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:09,000
local admin user demand account for that
kind of the main way that I get in as a

649
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,400
compromise asking admissions I grabbed
one system I'm new to the rest of the

650
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,620
systems in your environment

651
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:20,390
lower you suppose account to domain
admins ever ever ever ever need to login

652
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:21,980
to members

653
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:26,830
no we do not should never have a domain
admin ever logging into member server

654
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:32,619
ever period it will serve ramen for you
though that's great but don't exposure

655
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:35,570
domain controllers when you have domain
admins logging into a server in an

656
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:39,780
assist you now we're leaving Kerberos
tokens and cash credentials and a bunch

657
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,050
of other remedies across your home
network does your kid that's your king

658
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:48,220
no that's that's what you don't want to
lose in your environment policy

659
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,980
deployment

660
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:58,520
everything is no reason for you to have
introduced new tax on RT overtime this

661
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,910
one group policy is phenomenal

662
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:07,100
its deny access to this computer from
the network admins ever really need

663
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:13,089
access and shares ISA admins a local
minister ever need to access amateurs no

664
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:18,580
limit that when I can't pass the house
and I can't move laterally environment

665
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,819
that came to mind Jackson parish on
jackson also goes away because i dont

666
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:27,410
have to have server admins are and
wherever in that group you can define

667
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:31,759
the group to get rid of your local
account there's no reason for the top

668
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,250
slot of it might be hard to see and I
apologized on Twitter account it's

669
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:43,780
supposed to go to the sites where you
know as soon as I get done but things

670
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,920
got honey token these things are hard
for me to figure out because whenever I

671
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,140
run into their really messed me up I
want the main methods I use is called

672
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,839
Kerberos impersonation what happens is
that we are going to machine machine

673
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,160
then creates a Kerberos token for single
sign-on for that account right so if a

674
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,560
admin login or a user accounts or a
domain admin remember and whatever ends

675
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:07,090
up being the Kerberos counts and those
tickets are valid for certain periods of

676
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,150
time

677
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:13,270
balance based on group policy setting
default settings as ours rates I'm sorry

678
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:15,609
but our window to find a Kerberos token

679
00:49:15,609 --> 00:49:20,950
doesn't want their call me cast is also
various there will be other ones and

680
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,230
those specific ones they do is they use
an undocumented feature analysis to

681
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,819
tracker text passwords

682
00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:29,829
or you can use things like impersonating
Kerberos token her second Oscar as

683
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:35,049
tokens to become that person needs to
know the past and so we can do it honey

684
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:38,759
tokens as you can create fake money
tokens ride home environment on her way

685
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:42,440
home network and then there is what ends
up happening is when I go to impersonate

686
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,559
that are used that account even if it's
not active Zachary Esprit often get sent

687
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,160
here to make and chosen few minor one
specific about lawyers in infrastructure

688
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,410
ever happens and that ever you ever see
that one right there you have an issue

689
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:59,910
you have a problem that's a no no no
false-positive like stops bad internet

690
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:03,160
where people are using me because in a
bunch of stuff in your environment so

691
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,969
this is a one nighter command you can
run again chris nuttal task that creates

692
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:12,959
the net only command you know that you
run it goes in it will create those

693
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:16,198
Kerberos tokens in your environment is
critical task that run cross your own

694
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:21,430
permanent boom tokens environment no
impact our systems no notices it on and

695
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:24,899
some things that literally are one of
those early warning indicators that

696
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:30,259
something missus is happening tonight
from you should be enhanced mitigation

697
00:50:30,259 --> 00:50:35,180
experience toolkit merchant firefighters
about a month ago and it is a free tool

698
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:39,919
for Microsoft free download right now
Microsoft website is really hard in

699
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,459
doggy just double-click the MSI next
next use recommended settings and finish

700
00:50:43,459 --> 00:50:49,489
not a lot of companies are spending a
lot of time focusing on this one

701
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:55,479
specifically people freak out his car
brake system brake celebrates this is a

702
00:50:55,479 --> 00:50:59,348
very flexible you know what you're doing
weights you make it stop a lot of us

703
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:03,619
your day so they're not perfect in
numerous ways of getting around and what

704
00:51:03,619 --> 00:51:07,589
it does is that you give it a file you
can have it managed to put you through

705
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:11,959
policy now 55 its Group Policy Center
exceeds that but what you can do as you

706
00:51:11,959 --> 00:51:15,839
can see ok I wanted to protect these
applications and points one of those

707
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,339
gonna be browsers Office documents PDFs
Adobe right

708
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:31,288
job right job good condition but when
you have you want to protect the

709
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:36,489
applications that you know attackers use
and what happens is that when you

710
00:51:36,489 --> 00:51:40,259
specify those applications and install
machines what happens is that imports

711
00:51:40,259 --> 00:51:43,309
was called him an ideal out into those
things and it looks rosy red activities

712
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:47,009
this method I use as an attacker things
like what we call returned oriented

713
00:51:47,009 --> 00:51:51,579
programming iraq to get around the
execution pensioner RSI larger space

714
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:54,089
layout randomization all these
technologies are designed to stop us

715
00:51:54,089 --> 00:51:59,960
there no matter what does it look at
that should not be executing and stops

716
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:05,190
and shut it down a dozen or so it stops
a lot busier it is very good in fact

717
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:11,239
it's always free for you right now to be
able to using gives you a point so those

718
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:15,920
are those are some 25 ones so the truth
is that things are not that bad it's not

719
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,829
that bad things that we can do we are
getting better just take some time to go

720
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:26,039
through and do it one thing to know is
that for me personally i I live my life

721
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:29,119
in a way that I was trying to stay
positive it's my wife watches like all

722
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:34,019
these horrible TV shows I should
watching the OJ Simpson trial that comes

723
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:39,288
out you know you know but you know or
like murder mysteries and all the stuff

724
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:43,799
and i cant she can't even tell me about
them because I try to live my life maybe

725
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:46,479
a stuck my head in the sand and i dont
wanna know about it but I try to live my

726
00:52:46,479 --> 00:52:50,839
life to pop positive with all this fear
uncertainty and doubt that we here in

727
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:52,119
this industry it's not healthy

728
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:56,079
in fact it really ruins you
scientifically in your body for a lot of

729
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,979
negativity has not even healthy human
deal with this so I recommend a little

730
00:53:00,979 --> 00:53:03,499
bit of a positive you know one thing I
will show you is that there's a great

731
00:53:03,499 --> 00:53:04,769
book out there

732
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:09,819
recommends call originals and it's it's
it's interviews from some of the most

733
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:14,729
famous people across imagine Steve Jobs
logo on the book i think is a professor

734
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:15,210
at award

735
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:20,940
and so it was a really good book for me
at least go through and and in

736
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:25,400
washington why people are successful how
they're able to change what was standard

737
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,670
what was normal right because more what
isn't always better people like that are

738
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:32,690
going in doing SpaceX and using
off-the-shelf commercial you know things

739
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:35,839
to be able to build rocket ships were
changing the way that we do certain

740
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,119
things around batteries and things like
that how do they do that how does Apple

741
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,530
changing go a different way than
everybody else in the passenger is using

742
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:46,380
Microsoft how do you do that what was
interesting in what was a common theme

743
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:51,760
behind all of these people is that they
try to look at the positives of

744
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,570
everything he woke up in the morning

745
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:58,070
positive about what they were doing he
knew that they can change and eventually

746
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:01,930
and so that's a common thing and
security you wake up in the morning

747
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:05,080
saying hey I'm not going to be able to
tackle every single thing that's going

748
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,359
on right now in this world but I can do
my best and try to my best wake up a

749
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,060
much better person than having to have
the weight of the world in your hands

750
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:15,160
and being stressed out another
interesting thing is that Steve Jobs

751
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:21,598
field a lot of time a lot of times when
he was quoted as saying that there's a

752
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,150
company coming out in the medical field
was supposed to revolutionize the

753
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:28,619
medical field what they're doing I don't
know the exact specifics of it while but

754
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:32,180
Steve Jobs said this is going to be the
biggest company you're gonna see in this

755
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,859
role he wanted you want to give him like
a hundred million dollars for ten

756
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:40,330
percent of the company and the person at
the time said no I know I don't want

757
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:43,900
your money in a min ago bill to stop
myself in steve Jobs was so convincing

758
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,700
and all his friends on his own people
and was talking about how awesome is

759
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:52,569
100% certain that company was was last
year was one of the worst tech failure

760
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:56,109
that has ever happened to medical
insurer in history that we were right

761
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:01,280
and the reason is because Steve Jobs
very good at what he knows that gives

762
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,730
you a competence in other areas that you
might not know and so for me i think i

763
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,850
no security someone decent so I stay
within the confines of understanding

764
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:12,930
security when I know but I rely on
everybody else to make good decisions on

765
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:16,270
what they mean business to understand
what's going on like I know my business

766
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:19,800
is doing well from experts in the
business and i know that folks in iti

767
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,330
disaster recovery house working well and
know all these different areas of of

768
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:26,580
what I need to have a successful program
working that makes me make better

769
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:29,850
decisions about where I need to focus my
efforts I really recommend this book

770
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:38,020
person every time I do have a talk I do
have a winner for something at the booth

771
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:53,800
Justin pressure from Scott's you here
are you here so it's time on my talk I

772
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,850
hope we learn something new we have some
stuff happening afterwards giveaways and

773
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:59,759
things like that but thanks for sticking
around here and hereafter little bit

774
