1
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:21,600
language but what I say so after a
launch is hard to keep everybody off on

2
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,179
exciting to monitor try to be there 930
the body with my hands so that when you

3
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,550
can get and stay away but think you're
right according to do they have a little

4
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:40,880
time soaring federal starting with that
he's 30 or daughter Maria s what time

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,179
are getting to the presentations are
they about how to find security agencies

6
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:56,970
and also why and how they're open war
that we could use and how can you use

7
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:03,710
some of them for their value but there
are many presentations going on a bike

8
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:10,929
security so I'm going to try to do what
I could really use their power to try to

9
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:18,750
focus on the value assessment and body
reputation of security that's where I

10
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:27,070
want to be so just a kind of attention
getter

11
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,280
you know we all need peeps were
approached by the time we get in the

12
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,750
morning program combines the next to the
next budget cycle anyone happy to mobile

13
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:49,110
so it's not going to the next I quote so

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:28,130
to meet with another to your
organization in order CEO for one of the

borders CEO I bought an agreement a page
for being here

30
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,590
architecture that base layer
architecture triggered by many will go

31
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,150
out to get you also have to look into
that to face that you're not a

32
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:58,789
critically important work that garnered
with related to the to be ok now I just

33
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,720
wanted to get your opinion about two
things are going to provide what's going

34
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,510
on well go start to things that your CIA
do your part

35
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,659
you know not sleeping these days are
spent time about it so let me talk about

36
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:20,199
it and I'm gonna really like to see so
there are many prewar decision this

37
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,590
morning I Arab your niece

38
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,109
I thought but it doesn't sound fun and
so far there are many framework for many

39
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,150
things that treaty their current worked
or I might add me on skype you were born

40
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:41,270
in Germany so one of the questions he's
ok we need more help me w measuring

41
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,870
about you are finding it hard to prepare
for security so that we can deliver

42
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:57,320
because bob dole predicted that so many
of these have some value related items

43
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:05,820
remain here you will find there's a new
class called I practitioner her I just

44
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,240
came up with the market I feel she
introduced recently using lunch and

45
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,960
dinner IP protection 200% on value
creation customer value by depression

46
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,250
that's what they say that's what we
gotta do anyway I'm gonna talk about how

47
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:30,500
can we use these trade war for a
particular IQ security as mine I had

48
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:40,560
wondered that ok all right so why did
say there is a large number of IP

49
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,720
frameworks that are appearing the market
some of them are news on the game

50
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:51,020
arduous in hands so this presentation
will highlight which framework can be

51
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:59,909
used to enable be valuable IP and caused
by so I'm also pretty sure you to sample

52
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:06,300
their suffering working on a box to see
if we can show you some more

53
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:12,340
talk with you can take you know premier
some idea that you can you meet remained

54
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,710
been about so that you can start using
summaries and company share with you for

55
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,599
your security should do so before we get
into that book about what's happening

56
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:29,150
you have to go back to these two days
later pictures so we weren't playing

57
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,789
both really well-received we from where
you're very wrong I went but we're easy

58
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:42,410
to remember when I was working I was
gonna get a new washing machine or you

59
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:48,080
can actually connected to require you
can actually I'm going from one point I

60
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:58,180
was like ok so that was kinda what were
known about time then he will make you

61
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:06,550
know mainframes classroom laws according
to peace and unity better than I do they

62
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,270
are measuring nature created by network
world pretty brunette and now we're at

63
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,849
the beginning of clout

64
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:23,940
beauty big data tonight we're going to
start going to get better and better not

65
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:33,799
so today we are people quotes around one
so around that the Qur'an or the

66
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:43,250
and the economy just underneath so he
apologized you can already but I just a

67
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:51,180
few days ago during chambers wrote an
article on board that says that we're at

68
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:58,709
the beginning of the biggest ever yet
yet remind you of course the report will

69
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,920
fail

70
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,390
oK so that's an attention-getter right
may not necessarily fail to acknowledge

71
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:13,800
you got me feel short of the UN has
picked up by about that gets the next

72
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,240
round

73
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,300
parking but you can write a review them

74
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:24,859
things process automation rebuttable
sure probably where the office

75
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,810
properties you also bring closer look

76
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:37,260
album made sense or whether through our
watches for not pushing roads so there's

77
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,260
gonna be a lot of points will be
adequate indicted so force changing how

78
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:49,939
people are executed so we went from
corporations design processes

79
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,290
information age we went pretty good read
and then now we're in return for major

80
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,980
reinventing dropping property sold for
disease-causing

81
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,959
business cycles to change go back my
friend movers warren would choose 30

82
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,459
blank you know working so what's
happening it's all of these things all

83
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:22,239
reviews multimedia applications all four
are bringing a lot of a lot of saudi be

84
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,529
recycled when an apartment or crepes up
here you gonna do something like you had

85
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:33,360
a developer software and applications or
do something to react to that but it

86
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,680
cracked that's something that you cannot
wait for next year to the next budget

87
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,989
cycle and say neat or sourcing or an
insanely to financial ranking we gotta

88
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,660
do it now

89
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:55,230
makeup and made you so that's the
business cycle so to care about kids

90
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:01,550
that used to have a very discretionary
board it is not enough to be a bigger

91
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:08,099
pockets by where the base and the
architecture that allows companies to

92
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,779
put it where you can put your
applications and I signed into tears

93
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,410
when a year's gonna talk about that but
that's what that he and basically there

94
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,589
to portray your YouTube orkut

95
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:33,490
141 142 143 the corner where you been up
for like you know let's go to our place

96
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,830
in the united we can wait until next
year

97
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,600
devices either one but not with the way
we like to me and execute these are my

98
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:54,630
remarks so this is a concern why because
always be ok but these level of concern

99
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:00,510
is increasing because these shorter
cycles list bank to do due diligence

100
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:08,680
who do not think about it then we gotta
do things more projects there for the

101
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:18,189
security was increased berries and
there's more porn video right arrow

102
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,820
points or data and information call me
an hour and depressed so their

103
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:28,140
methodology uses that managed by you and
qualities which shows the number 12

104
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:35,699
management and i wanna talk about 10
right now which is not a good product

105
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,080
creation I'm gonna show you some of the
biggest book

106
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,980
who would read bTW prime forecast but
all of these are basically trying to

107
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:51,910
help you manage body so I'm going out to
expand on these but what is value this

108
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:57,400
is the traditional process for body
management ideas up here

109
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:05,459
units they go through this gave them the
very foundation and ending get approved

110
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,530
according to project management
interview I double bogeys and so far and

111
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:15,980
then they going to operations in there
might be needed security so the issue

112
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,460
one of the issues that he's writing that
you're very line role coordination

113
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:28,080
cooperation and made products that allow
you to track these viewers get it right

114
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:35,780
outcome and results from the project so
how many of these programs or corrupting

115
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:44,850
I think that will work for development
work with all their balls ok their hopes

116
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:51,160
he's a new approach his new book so that
the development team and a great team

117
00:13:51,160 --> 00:14:00,300
work together to automate things and
collaborate and communicate so there are

118
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:06,719
more that are appearing to allow these
connections and allow collaboration

119
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,580
between you and that includes a 32
operations application development of

120
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,300
small portion of their purposes one or
two

121
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:23,949
but there are going to be the right and
so that everybody not only within 90

122
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:32,590
broker with a be the fire so in the
village business environment is changing

123
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:37,470
drastically opportunities and threats
are constantly being recycled cardboard

124
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,660
are becoming posture might be a
particularly their quarterback operating

125
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:49,709
businesses having transformed format
organizers hope that our customers not

126
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:58,900
only turnover change in a locked door to
rely on decisions are learning to type

127
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,760
this side because they can go forward
for thirty years and they may rely

128
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,580
cleared all combined these cloud-based
application on my way to my trp alright

129
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:22,340
CRM well before that happens so there is
there are issues from early morning got

130
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:31,610
here so also attract new year later let
me know they need let's live do things

131
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,970
from scratch track which is great
because when you do something you know

132
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,780
baby I mean something new

133
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:43,610
there's no not benchmark data they're
hoping that we can you know so he's

134
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,470
hired

135
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:55,740
higher and higher 24 really take my
benefits right so again I'm gonna skip a

136
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,490
couple of these things because one of
his record numbers like they are coming

137
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:07,300
but their framework for help us to grow
from what I call a timeout at peak

138
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:13,240
putting the environment and between
these two have been either says lighter

139
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:20,980
just a minute but I T management is what
many of these he has to continually

140
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,980
improving but did you go through the
Employment Program

141
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:30,140
framework like IP for example and then
you go on go through the operation and

142
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:36,939
then later you update your metrics are
you perhaps are you happen to use

143
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:44,570
improvement bodies recycles used it not
by no means understand you don't know

144
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:55,110
baby you're good at it every year every
year so this innovation option would be

145
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:01,360
great now hired read about the bottom so
to succeed we need a more dynamic

146
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:09,030
approach ok here's where we gotta move
from reacted to practice that be cool

147
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:15,899
but not reactive means waiting to next
year will prob IP environment and

148
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,679
degrees and then refine our strategy our
book report on our services directly

149
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:29,020
with what we have here is to dynamically
I'm proactivity participate every pundit

150
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:38,150
participate there reported a party and I
weigh when the products approved we all

151
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:46,179
are aware of it and made it so that we
can make the successful and there are

152
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,520
not for practice right in their own
right

153
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:56,530
security things are fine and the
waterborne at one everyday living you

154
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,418
should already be five so that
everything there in your project we are

155
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,520
orbiting our to repeat everything we
need to do to be true that we're not

156
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,080
there yet so when the prewar

157
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,530
I love that about you management which
is

158
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:19,090
that allow us to have it to be with you
and your brother Charles people just

159
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,620
like for like quote

160
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:28,870
properly operating a great deal of
things that come up for a one-year cycle

161
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:35,709
so there are serious or frameworks W
what to do

162
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,710
overprint work how to do it

163
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:52,230
governance framework great comeback by
the way more poor governance for profit

164
00:18:52,230 --> 00:19:05,020
org there's a new IQ practitioner which
you are mean there are more box chrome

165
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:11,190
Balaji which all information that you
get a good business case you do what you

166
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:16,940
gotta do so they always override a bit
tell you what to do and how could they

167
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,880
have all this morning getting how to
operate how to work together to out we

168
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,860
made profits for that when any
appropriate because we both operations

169
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:33,350
there but an arc are coordinating that
work for you heard programs are received

170
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:41,428
for you guys tonight the security breach
of any your night I guess all urs check

171
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:50,720
you terrified itu itu organizations that
bad in addition that came up with idea

172
00:19:50,720 --> 00:20:00,629
is no quality control I they just wants
to use for fiber fiber proceedings and

173
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:12,759
it's on top I'd like to give you the
elements to be proactive organization so

174
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,340
I'm not about to just be aware of that
but they're very exciting program by the

175
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,959
way I mention base layer architecture
Porter group and i wanna talk about EDC

176
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:30,289
which is the proactive approach to make
sure that operate and and and and

177
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:35,759
communicate by reporters about some of
the elements of these approaches so

178
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:42,029
looking at some reasonable use you see
here which may extend to be reacted with

179
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:47,419
far more than I mean they react and come
to your baited

180
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:58,509
airport right management framework like
ISO 27001 so for some of them are poor

181
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:03,539
business management like corn and soy or
in other ones are poor value management

182
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:13,649
can be a stranger and I would probably
wait to hear about being in this case

183
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:21,029
and I T not well thought out what it was
like to use that

184
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,270
all of these fireworks are very good
they complement each other

185
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:32,200
the point at which worries me in both
parties warned that are closer to the

186
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:48,200
left sideline I'm in love you are more
Iraq war or so so if there's one thing

187
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,720
that I can tell you take from the poor
condition as a useful thing that I would

188
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:00,640
recommend you think a lot about what
happened today which is what I call a

189
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,960
week or maybe a trabajar plan so what we
report a man he's probably spend more

190
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:15,100
but more either more important business
case to be naming her number of women

191
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,500
but renaming to be the value and
changing change change your objective

192
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:27,080
business case and when to approve is
justified in Egypt even get the morning

193
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:34,620
approved the business plan baby I of
course to use to find a project but also

194
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,850
it will help you determine the base of
the party hop pop through the usual hugo

195
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:44,290
where you're going to produce or not
it's okay and and basically gonna be

196
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:50,200
based on audience and based on
recombinant lobotomy and in the business

197
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,800
plan include the elements that are you
out when I keep a petition to better

198
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,950
music European operations are very real
need to be this plan is approved so that

199
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:10,160
when the president's approval document
which one are you ok so it is not expect

200
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:18,730
project plan and we all know what it
called her horses which is this is more

201
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,970
focused on the Bayou what bob woodward I
create

202
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:29,280
how we're not quite library and you are
ordered to project its called you are in

203
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,460
fact that you provide to provide
security right worry assemblies were to

204
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,330
meet the exact you need to watch and you
put in your past the returnees to watch

205
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:44,540
and your password is keeping I can do
this are you going to reviews buyers

206
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:51,139
facts or pretend things are bound by
talking what are we going to do to

207
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:58,150
prevent with that firewall or occasional
what it is for the comment on the fact

208
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:03,100
that provide the technology security and
identity charges that receive the

209
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:14,100
benefits are all so weak or or I dynamic
IP budget management practice basically

210
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:19,959
changing from a business case to be
black and white child would probably be

211
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,870
easier to be which is being invited
plank is something that just by calling

212
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:31,469
your broker you find any ship you a plan
you would you everybody that this is how

213
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,050
we're gonna get you to plan their
divided

214
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:41,430
and I plan has to increase means 45
reborn in Old Dominion Pakistan

215
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:46,560
beneficiary of the stakeholders in the
validation and agreement on both made

216
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:54,370
between one by one his presentation will
be available to you as well as part of

217
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,010
the year

218
00:24:55,010 --> 00:25:07,990
conditions that they provide you up so
that here so I'm gonna book about one

219
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:15,620
principle what you need to do is plug or
principles friend working as a critical

220
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:22,350
part of one which is very important you
need stages how did you manage your

221
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:27,570
valuable data plan and how did you
develop couple who dat and finding new

222
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:36,280
things I love these books to their value
over is an issue so this is a framework

223
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,030
are basically the same thing I just
presented principled related to the

224
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,680
stages

225
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:46,330
related to and these are similar stages
out we saw it produces light someone up

226
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:55,159
about these particulars like so one of
the issues that we have more to say that

227
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:04,980
we don't have my way but say the
benefits of security and you should be

228
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,500
the help of my game

229
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,650
Arabian you ought to be this hard to
reach you know things that I found in

230
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,650
England and I will be in place there so

231
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:24,740
bound behind that I must have had a few
days ago you remember that you saw that

232
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:31,620
112 metres they went down and they won't
even bother and then other situation

233
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:36,199
when you combine that they'd be running
evaded baby do certain things for my

234
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,360
finger in there in your wing went
downhill so what can we do so that we

235
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,310
can use to find should help us maintain
revenue might bring beer with your home

236
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:54,750
search FITC jury so this framework EDC
has eleven different principles one of

237
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,560
them is this principle which is number
six and says my training profits or cash

238
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,669
you're not gonna registration is asking
boredness increase in profit so these

239
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,670
are very basic but very parliament

240
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,550
what projects have a business case to
increase by your premiums increase

241
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:17,580
profits how by reducing costs increasing
revenue record very what we don't have a

242
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:23,050
way to the terminal benefits I'm
quantify the benefits of pain but which

243
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:28,450
is fine costs that may be because he's
charging budget but one of those calls

244
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:36,540
and to predict revenue rap I security
protection security is not about

245
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:44,320
increasing bodies of up or pick a
warning cause I'm thinking driven so I'm

246
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,620
gonna tell you more about that but this
is an example that he thinks it could

247
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,620
have bought that we have obviously that
everybody in that case I have benefits

248
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,000
for category

249
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,370
higher chance of the benefits of yours
are doing the right thing by your

250
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:11,790
thoughts on this dictionary recorder so
I want to talk briefly about some

251
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:18,930
example tools that can be used to enable
de Haas speed

252
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:27,320
broach you know so that you can see the
part security number of about 10 Dec

253
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,909
made things more talk about the analysis
called the degree of urgency another one

254
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,470
called coach obsessional not easy summer
already been exported to someone about

255
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:42,270
each one of these are for me and then
what we call benefits aimed you like I

256
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,270
could attempt to stop the means

257
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:53,830
so this is same way same thing that I
just starting to show the previous night

258
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:59,780
he said he planned to talk about in this
article that can be used for secret for

259
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,680
trying to find a benefit some outlying
expected to predict is for the dumbest

260
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:10,760
people predict or mopping them between
view property and they've been hard at

261
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,830
work I stumbled reviewed part yet for
custom volume and measuring enough

262
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:22,550
patience on this is these made this week

263
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:28,600
the year and what we have here is fine
for now yes for potential needs are

264
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,469
being depressed areas which need to
fight technology needs work some believe

265
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,590
we have a need to increase our hero

266

276
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:34,419
a tease about increasing body of my

C and this is something that will take

283
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:22,100
me an hour to explain what explain why
it is very important when executives

284
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,699
made decisions to best you are asked to
see if all me see if all the financial

285
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,120
people have been good to things like
what is it about cost to produce quality

286
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:38,530
PC or financial return right to pay by
20 generator tour what is returned

287
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:42,990
and they do I need a commission said you
have any lot are they look at all the

288
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:46,670
products Court overturning were never
ending in wilderness I'm boarded based

289
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:53,350
on how many vehicles do they justify an
approved projects however many be

290
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:59,740
decided to dissolve longworth fatigue
body hurts more about our eye while the

291
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:06,530
opportunity to live it's ok we have to
also be sizes for PWD index which is

292
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:11,750
what's down there we have two popular 49
record and their other criterion which

293
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:16,270
suggests that we have the right
resources and so far but doesn't he was

294
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:22,430
second topple generation me see if for
senior to rank credit ratings but this

295
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:27,200
is what's new this is what I'm gonna
show you what it keeping your CIA and

296
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:34,910
CEO of 1942 now we are ranked according
to their trying to figure out which is

297
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:41,380
not only what is the impact of this
program financially and its 40 back but

298
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:47,720
what is the degree of urgency to be
softened up you go now implemented not

299
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,780
because their salaries we don't do it we
meet on April 24 we don't do it we have

300
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,940
an incident like Nike breach or
something that happens that we may not

301
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:05,040
protect our pain and we lose revenue
passenger so you know things that so and

302
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:12,010
what is the speed which speech so these
criteria is paid that either ok and this

303
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:17,940
is where the guard rear Paisley
architecture falls into a well help

304
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,810
determine which party is going to reach
speeds which is race day based on the

305
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:32,610
degree of urgency ok so this is what no
CEO COO CFO CEO or two before trying to

306
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:37,300
determine water is my new favorite area
popular besides the impact of the group

307
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,480
William C

308
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:48,929
so of course that was not particularly
fond of you that well every project have

309
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:55,330
been tracked and ticks Ixodes we think
ecology sign depression that makes it is

310
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:59,439
100% certainty damage well that's not
the case

311
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:08,460
all benefits printing project actually
already how uncertain medium or high but

312
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:14,690
because you're poor kathy is anything
later movies I make prevent easy to read

313
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:19,730
your four Captains ok predicted to that
name in apartment so could be lower and

314
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:25,609
higher so these tools which is called
her to be nice to be here who are

315
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:31,090
composition analysis due out in fact I'm
not a cease and then understand the

316
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:38,230
relationship no certainty of a project
is not the cost is not affect the

317
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:43,469
relationship between the quotient so
people ask well what's tangible wasn't

318
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:46,428
under both well we can argue all night
but at the end of the day it's because

319
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:49,780
one is more certain no one is more
uncertain Rep

320
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:55,940
so what's important needs to notify
benefit management vendor that honestly

321
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:01,990
book and Meyer you the benefit measure
you can be measure when you want to file

322
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:07,459
and then you can be fine how much can we
improve or reduce or increase the

323
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:13,550
forecast well that's going to ban on the
uncertain the relationship between this

324
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:19,530
is what I gonna do for a pic or reduce
or changed and this is the fact how many

325
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,710
were gonna of these particular pic
weather incidents or revenues of

326
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,410
transactions or whatever your prob anger
when people do that we can measure and

327
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:34,520
quantify so the depending on the type of
conversation the degree of uncertainty

328
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,690
can be higher or lower than the
predicted holder Bennett

329
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:45,880
ok I'm sure your concepts and I wanna
knowledge that this is related to tell

330
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,579
how to properly given you enough ideas
about how to get some of these benefits

331
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:54,990
are part of these middle worried about
her way already

332
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,900
and then the last thing is about what we
quoted benefits in separate occasion

333
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:07,980
every benefit you can kind of structure
which is what why how r structure every

334
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:14,580
benefit so I can quantified in game so
the maintain a continued today the

335
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:20,920
following if you can measure of anything
he doesn't matter whether these

336
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,480
customers loyal customer satisfaction
employee satisfactory but they sure can

337
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:34,270
you believe in your heart you can
measure it you can't find similar issues

338
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:38,610
and how much of that gonna do about the
forecast which is going to depend on the

339
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,850
relationship YouTube across anything but
a message here is that any benefit to

340
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:48,470
you quantify what can I measure because
you measure the effect the measure of

341
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,899
the things they do know what the outcome
is when I mean business and then you can

342
00:36:52,900 --> 00:37:02,650
still get your Microsoft eggs Mighty
Wurlitzer use our technology made and

343
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:08,670
this Romana provide in NBC's The
Saturdays the ATI orbiters haria

344
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:15,180
declines that are going to receive and
you can find the KPI forward to plug it

345
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,830
when I get it by then again I'm gonna
have time to explain to your message to

346
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:29,040
you that any benefit have talked to her
of course and teach you how to have a

347
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,400
structure right away

348
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,980
based on best practices in but edition
for the accuracy of the monetary

349
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,910
contribution but point here and I'm
trying to recuse that you can measure of

350
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,279
benefit but matter what it is you can
quantify and you

351
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:50,940
truck bed and you can get quality no no
I'm not sure you got pics how you play

352
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,930
in your band

353
00:37:51,930 --> 00:38:05,299
ok so I know how much time with my
family so I'm gonna start here and I'm

354
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:13,060

355
