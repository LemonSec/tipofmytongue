1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,319
technical difficulties on the
presentation more from a perspective but

2
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:09,790
the connection in the colors such as
soon as it comes back to the proper

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,879
cabling will be able to get you to call
it going but I thought it's not go ahead

4
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:16,540
and talk to you

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,759
civically cloud workloads security and
the six critical criteria that we

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:30,060
believe are important when you deploy in
a cloud environment so called passage we

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,699
are a startup based on at the San
Francisco Bay Area cloud infrastructure

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,040
security and compliance focused company
we have 150 customers enterprise

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:50,070
customers today about a large number of
them in the fortune 500 and what we are

10
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,360
seeing is a huge transformation from
respected you leery about tea and

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,300
security using new methods like that
right and those methods are not

12
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,189
controlled by ITV controlled by your
business goes into utility

13
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,539
orchestration types of things that
happen and with that comes a huge amount

14
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:18,459
of challenges related to stop at
acquiring data centers challenges

15
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:23,499
related to how you deliver new
applications orchestration tools and the

16
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:27,318
existing environment you have today with
your security controls and security

17
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:34,909
doors do not necessarily crashed into a
cloud-based season just because they

18
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:39,740
have said and cloud-based appliances
doesn't mean they crashed into the cloud

19
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,889
that easily and security and compliance
you have the biggest challenge really

20
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:52,420
loud crash mansion and that's what's
going on today so we're not obvious

21
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,889
security and I think this is a slide
that marketing created to be funny so

22
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:06,259
yes it's funny but a lot so what's
happening today from a data sent back to

23
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,568
the existing data that

24
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:16,108
you living in isolated infrastructure
mom and focus on your perimeter networks

25
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:21,540
and stations would you like to help
patients would you like to restructure

26
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:28,790
or hardware bare metal casing and you
have a pressing need be and such

27
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:37,060
behind you protected by your tools and
in an approach internal to your dad is

28
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:52,760
coming up so moving on will be seeing in
the when you have this kind of

29
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,760
infrastructure

30
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:46,030
so going from that internal data center
you have with those applications you

31
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,790
control with instruction you can call
with the perimeter and network-centric

32
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:56,790
what you can and with your clients you
have today through your power all power

33
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,350
finance your ideas ideas your web
application firewalls and protecting

34
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,459
this application was a traditional dad
and mom and what you've been doing today

35
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:12,910
and then from there he moved on to this
is regular internal

36
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:24,419
cloud-based application sought an
eternally infrastructure that but this

37
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,479
is using things like so provisioning
direct involvement with VMware vCloud

38
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,160
OpenStack infrastructure now this
applications that were around the

39
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,790
reading the data center behind a
firewall Mukesh ad posted and shared a

40
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:46,940
pitcher and now the applications running
routes in your firewall behind your file

41
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:56,120
structure internally so tied up but
still a private hosted model when you

42
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,360
are behind the pilot and you build that
and I what you're trying to do is to

43
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,450
move higher as computer amounts increase
in the utility model you get some

44
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,900
efficiencies from moving to the cloud
that's what you see right through you

45
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,070
not want to move some infrastructure to
the cloud because you see the efficiency

46
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:21,340
agility and moving the clock from that
internally hosts it until she go ahead

47
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,489
and build a BBC you still have a permit
to build a BBC of what your private

48
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,110
cloud and Amazon Google compute
environments

49
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:47,180
this all the challenge but

50
00:05:48,249 --> 00:05:52,689
so you building that and then put city
we want to be secure so we're gonna go

51
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:58,799
ahead and do the end of watch a private
network to that BBC right so what you

52
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,609
want to do is use that existing

53
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:05,619
you have already built spending millions
of dollars and network-centric tools and

54
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:10,489
security tools and while you want a fact
you trying to back calls all that work

55
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:15,198
to a private cloud information through
your traditional

56
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:22,229
so this problem going to use and your
back calling all unit but crappy

57
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:32,599
latency right huge issue from a band
with perspective and availability and it

58
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:36,669
creates a lot of issues for deploying
applications with the agility and speed

59
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:43,039
you're required to do so the Mex
approach was to find visibility into

60
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,909
that infrastructure that's running in
the cloud which you don't get with this

61
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:52,109
point you to the next step was to move
all those security prices you have in a

62
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:56,459
hot with one pack it into a bushel
iPhone packed into the cloud environment

63
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:02,619
the problem days this particular
hardware we talk about exploration with

64
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:08,439
high-density Lee chips like they were
built specifically to those how kitchen

65
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:14,179
to do security into a specific Agra domu
very easy to do and Amazon EMI and

66
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:19,349
provide the same kind of missions as
you're looking very expensive to run in

67
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:24,878
a cloud computing model so that doesn't
help you as for securing and providing

68
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,189
visibility and providing concludes you
want in your cloud-based

69
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:35,999
so we are proposing is that when you
move to a cloud based architecture

70
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:39,939
whether it's a private cloud public
cloud and hybrid environment

71
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:45,559
structure using utility computing
internally what you must do six things

72
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:51,279
and what those things up is one the
security must be at the workload right

73
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,879
which means that the security must be at
the compute level

74
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,949
computing with the structure in going to
the cloud right where they'd see in

75
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,550
total base

76
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,250
hard right you have an infrastructure
for moving to a cloud based on mom or a

77
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,330
hybrid the next thing you need to cover
a broad set of controls within the

78
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:18,039
security of implies so popular is
virtually in a bit more important thing

79
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,060
aspect of moving to the club and
providing the Julian the speed and the

80
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,790
deployment capacity Yuyuan Garden mom is
your position and this is an area that

81
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,360
you get to hear more and more as
companies move to a week almost to a

82
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,850
mighty moving from the existing
infrastructure to a cloud-based

83
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,920
automation becomes extremely important
you can hear these again and again as

84
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:47,250
you get the other aspect it as you move
to the cloud infrastructure you still

85
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:53,710
want to be able to mind the gap between
the two you go from the internal data

86
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:59,360
center into a cloud environment you want
to be able to use tools to what platform

87
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,120
you're using to would we do you have
with security and controls and

88
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,790
compliance as well as a cloud involved
and scaling would clean horizontally the

89
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,900
ability to go not only skill up in a
cloud infrastructure back in the cloud

90
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,760
model you want to be able to scale down
most of these security tools have a

91
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,930
great amount of difficulty that existing
today moving scaling down good there is

92
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,209
huge you know

93
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:32,350
hardware that's a high density and very
focused on large amount of capacity they

94
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,990
can scale down to my car service like Dr
B's contain it out and then horizontally

95
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,590
just kill thousands of soldiers and
hundreds of thousands of containers as

96
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:49,430
you move into a container the reality of
I T today price on this europe brand-new

97
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:55,630
Stata is that you're gonna have a
combination up existing to existing

98
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,980
infrastructure and some moving to the
cloud using automation so you need to

99
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,370
get these two together and the platform
needs that while it secure what quotes

100
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,880
sayings

101
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,220
if you look at security of the world but
what does that mean it's like you know

102
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,230
somebody asked you know what you up the
bank and that's where the money's right

103
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,500
so same goes here this is where the
computer is happening it's not a

104
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,580
monolith happening at a computer level
in a cloud-based architecture where they

105
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:32,220
take contain amicus a survey that you
sign up in Amazon actual computer or

106
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:41,390
even your internal it's a layer of
abstraction he has no specific network

107
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,040
boundary it doesn't have any primitive
hypervisor nothing's gonna always

108
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:53,030
abstract about it then it's a workload
its cute and it needs to be a policy

109
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,260
driven because you need to apply as you
compute as you see the cloud

110
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,930
infrastructure you need to apply to
securing controls stats you need to be

111
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,680
policy and logically group what we mean
by that is why law it is all good

112
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,260
network-centric reported assault from my
perspective need to be able to group

113
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,600
these were closed up antennas or any
type of so being sucky moving to the

114
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,160
cloud in a way that makes sense for your
support separation of duties your

115
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:28,110
compliance requirements and security and
then be able to apply automatically

116
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:33,230
enjoying right so those are critical
aspect what you want to do of course

117
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:40,520
portability scalability all the good
ones are cross was out the clock is a

118
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,530
critical aspects of what you want to do
security at the workbook a different way

119
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:49,760
of thinking because you're so used to
getting your network appliances getting

120
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,100
your firewall is blocking intersection
that you can touch when you can't just

121
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,520
sayin structure when you moving to an
environment that's boosting

122
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:06,160
thousands of surveys every other day or
every month however you want to avoid an

123
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,319
automated fashion the workload specific
compute will quote specific security and

124
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:20,120
control so we talked about what we mean
by that is

125
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:25,369
operating instructions that you want on
the operating environment with Windows

126
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:35,989
operating secular and then application
stack it so so a compute instance or

127
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:40,739
what we call it what boat isn't just
happened just because you don't instance

128
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:47,499
or a my Linux instance Amazon it happens
because you have a specific book a cutie

129
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:57,720
that happens throughout the book goes
abroad said this is nothing new this is

130
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,709
like the basic important blocking and
tackling you today every day right

131
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:09,858
visit you have that all the control you
need in your internal medicine but using

132
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:13,079
some of that when the perimeter
dissolves in the network model is off

133
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:22,069
and segmentation you want strong access
control module into your cloud

134
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:30,910
infrastructure as you move to manage the
ability to do an on-demand scan whether

135
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:39,059
through a GUI di he was 99% of most
egregious recent past year had been

136
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:42,059
through normal abilities were reported
as a CBE

137
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:48,470
so the bad guys how is appreciated you
think they are they using basic

138
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:55,160
existing and it's nothing and nothing
more nothing less than using and hacking

139
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:06,809
into what you haven't hatched century
data protection that a compromise

140
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:12,639
managed centrally looking at any type of
malicious activity indicators compromise

141
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,029
and take necessary immediate action so
all these things I talked to none of

142
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:26,489
this is new it's what you do today and
what you have an existing policies was

143
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:32,639
seen the automation aspect so when you
deploy through rapid deployment

144
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,400
technologies or a job

145
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:42,650
orchestrate that deployments with you I
cause that's what gets into a cloud

146
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,520
environment with the controls abroad
said it could cause you're looking at

147
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,949
putting so what are those broad set of
controls it could be as I talked to

148
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,210
software configuration security
management very important to make sure

149
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:02,750
you get so instances you can get into a
cloud environment rarely has the

150
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,060
necessary configuration settings are
hardened configuration settings

151
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,739
according to ISO you when things like
this out which is the government

152
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,170
standard for internal Department of
Social Security and applications

153
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:23,339
discovery you want to check east-west
traffic ingress egress points in your

154
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:30,210
infrastructure when you deploy the cloud
even if the cloud instance instance like

155
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,350
a docket contain it

156
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,870
you want to make sure you discovered a
crappy keep it locked to look for those

157
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,160
anonymous activities

158
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,880
look for compromise traffic tied you
applications internal process these

159
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,570
numbers and use it is very important to
understand that traffic was backed

160
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,790
viable management orchestration the
entire Microsoft around this every

161
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:59,010
borough instances very important ability
to provide separation duties when you

162
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:04,730
don't have that you know were close to
compute instance that changes constantly

163
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:11,020
problem in 2009 mama doing so in going
from different provided managing

164
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,760
accounts

165
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:21,340
place and you provide service security
on many occasion detecting intrusions

166
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,370
through blogging whining anomalous
activist shot by integrity monetary

167
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:33,110
checking you operating structure files
registry again

168
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:39,960
combination these controls it right at
securing funds you look so this I talked

169
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,670
to has considered to be the most
important aspect of what we do from a

170
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,229
work perspective and different level of
thinking from what you're used to

171
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,710
in the traditional mode wanna fight you
might even put employment scenario so

172
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,280
I'll get to that in a bit so automated
orchestrated by what that means is that

173
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:05,589
today when you provision and in my name
is on a new provision 8,000 continues on

174
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:11,530
a doctors over the DevOps folks it's a
culture as well as a operational

175
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,349
deployment methodology they just want to
be bothered by the security folks be

176
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:20,679
controlled like this one and deploy as
many releases as they can't and the

177
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,670
deployment of being challenged us to the
security folks and compliance both

178
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,340
always want control so there's a
constant challenge chasing of the day

179
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,070
bopd release cycle from the security
folks and compliance books to understand

180
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:38,790
how we can secure this instance you
really see how it is comprised of this

181
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:46,129
is usually when we come across my heart
he saw his prob what we need to do is

182
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:54,360
provided policy orchestrated using them
up with using Chapman property and

183
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,699
provide that security at the moment

184
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,600
provision right so when you deploy a
bowl game engine you want to spin up

185
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,480
thousands of so what you want to do is
apply to security policies the server

186
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,200
hardening policies while integrity
policy at the moment deployment at the

187
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,300
moment provision so then it becomes

188
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,169
working together she complies and
working together and it becomes it def

189
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,540
second-story your sector and gonna get
those two more and more as we progress

190
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:43,070
through the cycle of moving from the
traditional like whatever so you had a

191
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:48,610
situation where I T control its
deployment cycle

192
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,809
the release as well maybe 10 20 year
traditional waterfall based

193
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:58,750
methodologies were used and had a system
analysis and deployment cycle everybody

194
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:06,280
knows what's happening today that you're
getting at least psycho done every month

195
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,660
and that some companies one of the
customers o'clock passage is Netflix

196
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,460
support a child not only AM is are you
there

197
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,429
thousands of workloads running an Amazon
did bring them up and down every day but

198
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:23,510
also put their bus so when you combine
all of this release like that happen

199
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,460
very frequently has become very
challenging to deploy security writes

200
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:35,559
this story and what better way to those
cycles through multiple death teams you

201
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:40,649
multiple releases every month until nine
o'clock passage we release about every

202
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,900
six weeks we have a new incremental
release coming up

203
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:50,090
reality about shop us and and the
methodologies and kind of limit cycles

204
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:55,840
very different from what you use
traditional so what you need to do it

205
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,500
with that caused security controls and
policy in place as you deploy and

206
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,880
provision your instances whether they be
in the private cloud infrastructure

207
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,419
using utility computing public or hybrid
type you want to do your code testing

208
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:15,440
unit testing all the things we've done
when you deploy that at that compute

209
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:25,450
level and all this information
collecting from Michael segmentation to

210
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:31,400
ingress egress traffic as you deploying
cloud infrastructure spending to

211
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,970
internal reporting dashboard with its
gyasi compliance simple continuous

212
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,720
monitoring and expand internally to know
those things so you have a RESTful API

213
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:53,600
that sends out information directly so
what does that mean that supports this

214
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,649
type of cloud infrastructure needs
support not only the cloud-based

215
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,799
deployments but internal data center
right

216
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:07,309
so you looking at supporting your data
center hosted service today they could

217
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:12,299
be badly they could be what you like
supporting a colo Saudi that controls

218
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:17,450
just the physical infrastructure and
then moving on multiple public provided

219
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,239
by the Amazon today as you tomorrow

220
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:30,820
IBM Software Rackspace will you will you
run it will be a provide that security

221
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:37,189
controls and compliance control across
this full appeal is whether using Intel

222
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,200
XO and again

223
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,999
bridge the gap between type of
instruction with a single single pane of

224
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:53,489
glass of security and plus I think this
is an extremely important aspect of what

225
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:59,590
cloud infrastructure would look right
this situation where I internally sucks

226
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:09,249
day be a medal says 6428 gig of memory
or 2012 good memory and asking for

227
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:13,869
instance avoid showing stands between
megabyte memory in desktop

228
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:18,019
infrastructure is not a big deal but you
have a lot of you when you go to the

229
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:23,609
cloud and for example an Amazon a
migraine since are now known as small as

230
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:29,178
you can ask what that type of you power
in those instances could be 10 megatons

231
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:36,700
so what is hunter systems in your
computer from a local data center

232
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,389
virtualization voices thousands of
computing says you're looking for in a

233
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:47,209
cloud environment could be tens of
thousands of 60,000 you go to microsoft

234
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,950
office you looking hundreds of thousands
of containers that go away every every

235
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:59,609
half an hour later it would happen it so
we're moving away from the model of the

236
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:06,418
Soviet Union factory that built
everything to a smallest level to

237
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,100
compute the world is moving away from
this instance

238
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,689
smaller and smaller compute instances so
if you look at in the past

239
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:22,700
the deal would have taken several
minutes to load up if you look at it

240
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:30,880
since you're looking at about a minute
to get container so Mike services we're

241
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,770
looking at about milliseconds instantly
up as you want because they were

242
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:41,320
stripped down version Connell and also
so you need to be able to support

243
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,399
visibility and Micah segmentation the
controls from scripts backed it into

244
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,230
that small computer with its going from
a lot service you deploy Microsoft

245
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:57,630
tennis so black support this level the
smallest ever has posted the biggest

246
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,410
that was a scalability is going moving
down and most of the existing tools

247
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,320
today

248
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,020
unable to support at that level to
compute the security and control you

249
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,940
looking for that's the challenge of
improving existing permit a netbook or

250
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,580
into tools into the clock and then there
were designed for him I could never

251
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,230
designed for it now knowing since
compute and that's what it seems that

252
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:29,800
using to deploy line utility find a
speech to the reality light eats not

253
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,000
Greenfield

254
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:40,120
they'll be fantastic if it's a reality
right so we can easily do it you know

255
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,090
destroy the trees and build some new
factories out there but that's not be

256
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:51,860
out looking at reality is this which is
positive existing infrastructure and

257
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:57,449
some that might move to the cloud some
might say it's into that green up soon

258
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,300
you're looking at so we need to be able
to deal with this reality with a

259
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,500
platform that's both both ends of the
story is nobody is heated to the right

260
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,720
unless your brand new side of just
knowing for sure and no no BC I will

261
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,380
give you money to buy infrastructure
today this is going to be everybody's

262
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:21,670
starting probably but the enterprise
that existing today under percent not in

263
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:26,660
meet existing infrastructure maybe not
in person on the green Prince talk about

264
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,070
you in a combination of both

265
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:37,090
so let me try to explain this one this
is something that got more to do more

266
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:43,139
but I T is additional now you are using
existing technologies waterfall methods

267
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:50,990
and you're releasing outpatients every
couple of times and you have a very long

268
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:56,179
kid and so oriented meetings and you
have been a traditional a soft analysis

269
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:02,410
going on before you put the proper and
getting less and less as time moves on

270
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:10,070
the upper the green light year the Queen
Margaret talk about MOTU of I T

271
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:16,570
we're looking at a Sprint show-business
demanded the speed you looking for and

272
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:21,510
folks are moving there may be there in
20 that patients initially low risk

273
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,990
applications into that day off a psycho
we talked about before but as you move

274
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:31,210
companies are so many here right now as
you move on that deployment cycle

275
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:37,130
accelerates and eventually all organized
social mood to give up its I don't know

276
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,110
when that will happen but they'll have
more applications I'm 02 of IP the

277
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,928
spending methodology deployment because
of the competition that you gonna face

278
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:49,300
from other businesses that are pointing
at Dollar Tree and then this could be

279
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,800
something in between so the tools you a
platform you choose for security

280
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:59,010
controls and compliance moved to the pot
need to support bookmarks that support

281
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:09,320
so reality today what you like
infrastructure service maybe you have to

282
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:15,790
compute model until we have some
customers who do that until they made

283
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:22,389
using continues into custody papers so
delivery but they may be using their bob

284
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:28,730
stewart's like sharpen and Jenkins type
of Engineers integration using be cloudy

285
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:35,150
but then you may be moving to the cloud
you testing set now because of the

286
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,129
options you gonna get the outdoor
business will be mad at you because of

287
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,860
the same you get probably running under
met you and this is a challenge comes
