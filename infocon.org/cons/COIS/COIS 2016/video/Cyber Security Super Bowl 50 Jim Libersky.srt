1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:09,810
but the goal was to have about an access
point for every 100 seats so I decided I

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:18,400
don't mind but all accessible also there
are 1,200 beacons distributor are so you

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,538
can become more granular in that sphere
of 100 seats for a number of reasons

4
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:33,410
part of it being when something happens
kinda like to know where you should go

5
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:40,890
real quick right so they were used for
some of the geolocation there was more

6
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:49,710
to get gigs available in through that
whole time for the news 10 terabytes so

7
00:00:49,710 --> 00:01:00,850
I gig gig gig you're looking at
somewhere around 78,000 miles a second

8
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:07,570
bailout style structure senator some
very reasons but so the other attribute

9
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,859
with you at all

10
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:13,559
probably a great and then what's
happened is the social media site saw

11
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:21,780
kicked in so we ended up there's a lot
of those type of things we did not

12
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,700
monitor any the social media so our
particular role was all about that wired

13
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:39,929
and wireless networks so you also have
other individuals like oh not just the

14
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:46,979
carriers but the networks so they had
some of their own networks and hope

15
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,530
feeds and things like that though they
were they were responsible for so but at

16
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:59,069
some point I'm you know you have to ask
a lot of communications going on and

17
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,929
acceptor the huge debate social media
front-and-center

18
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,800
dunno 40

19
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,950
you know we see the papers we see the
debates but at some point you know you

20
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,869
gotta find where there any chance you
get ahead of them so we'll see how that

21
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,960
ends up but you're also getting a lot of
ads out of it also means that it's a

22
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,950
huge revenues 30 advertisers are looking
at it too so tremendous eyes on the

23
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:37,140
screen value there so it's all about
enhancing experience for directions

24
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,559
whether to get there

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,410
weather is whether it's the apps you are
where you gonna get food whether you

26
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:50,299
want to partake in a survey you are
partaking in you know maybe there's like

27
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,120
the best paid player

28
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:59,710
some game that goes on but in a lot of
cases even the NFL is trying to add that

29
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:16,090
user experience driving it so we were
part of a team has basically it becomes

30
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:23,550
the cyber security team but also yes the
NFL's there yes the 49ers were there

31
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:30,930
there stick which basically runs and
state but also all the various agencies

32
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:37,670
and Ichiro is your one might expect so
you haven't won since you have talked

33
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:45,220
about that would be everybody's gotta
roll it so what happened to preparation

34
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:51,260
for this started imagining months
beforehand and each individual group say

35
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,399
whether it's your federal agents are
private I would start the process months

36
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,810
before the game sometimes a year and a
half to planning and in the preparation

37
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,470
and our case we came out in the fall so
we are ready to start December 12 we

38
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,280
were monitoring ok there's a few other
started at a time but that's what parts

39
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,350
lot

40
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:21,420
so the preparation is a life lesson
understand the network but sometimes you

41
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,580
really truly get a perspective of what
that networks doing now we all say I

42
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,039
don't networks can volatility so that's
the only thing to do

43
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:36,230
there was one of those professionally
done a very high quality and stand-up

44
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,320
assessment and penetration test is
finished about a week and a half before

45
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:50,670
that's something that's a static look at
dynamic piece is kicking in so we ended

46
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:56,470
up in what we decided people started to
prepare for it we didn't they didn't

47
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,150
look at it as it typically do you have a
firewall do you have to have it you have

48
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,830
yeah right so what really came out and I
thought was kind of interesting and I

49
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,409
got that one of the guys had wrote this
was actually the original office authors

50
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:14,710
of the CISSP program on the testing this
week he was also the second-ranked you

51
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,710
the CIO CSO College in North America

52
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,910
his perspective let's take a look at a
difference in his the question is a

53
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,450
sensors are we catching everything so
instead of going just by firewall

54
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,960
firewall except by things source
destination protocol that's it needed

55
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,680
peace but that's covered right so now
what about timing protocols all the

56
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,980
protocols artist answers for these type
of things are you looking at just tires

57
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,280
are you looking at payload are you
looking at the list goes on

58
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,539
ok are you looking to have kids they
look at where they keyloggers all these

59
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,730
things are now become senators and that
was part of the conversation to

60
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:15,520
determine is what was going to be
selected for part of the team how deep

61
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,530
you look how deeply respect of course in
the forensic science can I capture

62
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,739
everything and look later

63
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,920
not part of this preparation was also
been learning about who your old

64
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,190
commands were at the end this which I
was a little surprised they were not

65
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:35,920
automated it could be so there was quite
a few eyes on the screen at 10 gigs

66
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:43,390
there's a lot you can catch so there's
going to be a movement towards

67
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,570
automation there's no other way but you
have to be accurate so that was the

68
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,870
peace or some checks and balances built
in all the way through the reporting

69
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:59,120
structure so in our case part of the
site for the wired and wireless we

70
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,980
reported up through the police side as
in the present side and correlated with

71
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,990
all the other agencies as well so low
some cross hairs are vertical

72
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:16,760
coordination that went on in the case of
baseline traffic so we actually put in

73
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,890
and some others did earlier but we
monitored Levi stadium starting December

74
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:27,909
first there's others that were probably
about before so what we were looking for

75
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,729
is traffic going when nobody's owner

76
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:36,589
as well as what happens when there's an
attempt at the end of the day one of the

77
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:43,499
real concerns over come up again as an
apt how do you know that there isn't

78
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:49,509
something just sitting there and a wake
up right turn the game into do something

79
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:56,669
so we wanted to be part of the base
lining is the extreme accuracy so in

80
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:00,219
part of the planning to this is a part
would probably would have done a better

81
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:03,219
job how do we know

82
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:10,990
the people that moved the company's
except on their having all of their

83
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:18,940
party isn't showing off the new
technology right and come up again but I

84
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,570
was good point to bring it up of a
sudden by knowing the network to know

85
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:31,409
where the if they're doing this for the
updates coming from we're almost done

86
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:38,200
confronted about two days before the
game I was suddenly see this recent

87
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:45,430
traffic from Ireland for an update from
where the famous AP which was perfectly

88
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,449
but in the states that we're at in
everybody's stakes as well

89
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,000
know where those places are done with
those addresses are because of changes

90
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,210
you gotta now so

91
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,380
a chain of command really kind of a life
lessons for all of us is that if you

92
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,820
find something whose role is it that
hard case we had to gel as a team pretty

93
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,839
quick and there wasn't a lot of you know
getting to know each other over a period

94
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,649
of time so we quickly kind of decided
who was gonna get what

95
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:22,980
carved out everybody's role and so if it
happens it go up the chain of command

96
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:30,140
will give some examples but all crucial
so we talked about monetary part of the

97
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,550
reason the margin is like a lot of
states are using it for other things

98
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,319
injustice the Super Bowl or for the
49ers are using it for concerts are

99
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,540
using it for local events the day we are
there there was a local track me high

100
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,439
schools at least writing across country
I'm not sure which one so we installed

101
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,500
so but other things

102
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:00,930
WrestleMania WrestleMania drew 70,000
people will talk about that Taylor Swift

103
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:07,770
same thing we also monitor the Foster
Farms college ball in january 1 so if

104
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,020
you can imagine all of a sudden just a
few little things we get traffic

105
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,029
nobody's

106
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:19,760
command control things right I'm here
now it's back up for it doesn't look

107
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:30,790
like much but bedtime is amazing what
wakes up our biggest concerns we're

108
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,390
going to start before the game was
throughout that first year with prior to

109
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:41,610
game in 2015 there was over fourteen
fiber cuts all public knowledge of fiber

110
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,459
cuts the reality was was it deliberate

111
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:55,199
accidental some you might know something
might not know we have some information

112
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,670
but not all information so but that's
one of the things you have to prepare

113
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,870
for against think of all the fibers you
would have a big event here even even

114
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:11,980
with our house State Michigan game if
somebody really wanted to become a

115
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:20,620
drivers in the city so the other as I
mentioned earlier new traffic shoring up

116
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,170
so we're not catching the absent this
time but we're catching see what what is

117
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,689
out there that nobody else is doing just
the normal traffic so we're set a

118
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,920
baseline as people coming and you're
gonna have to reset that baseline time

119
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,209
and time and time again

120
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:40,790
ok that's where the pieces work toward
her other concerns a PT's

121
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:48,030
suddenly wake up and next thing you know
who by the way from our own by the way

122
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,540
that command control didn't go a
particular IP address or didn't go to a

123
00:11:52,540 --> 00:12:01,170
particular part they want some place
else may be PDP maybe something else

124
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,479
maybe

125
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,670
products don't see it now but what
happens if it goes to talk

126
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:16,649
darkness these things have to be
considered in the case with phishing

127
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:22,490
attacks and course ran somewhere in
there was a lot there's a lot of fake

128
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,019
tickets trying to be sold and we catch
on it you know and there was some

129
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:33,990
investigative work out and sources and
who they were and things like that that

130
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,959
was going on as well some of the soft
targets if there's riders things like

131
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,300
that of a part maybe because of what's
going on the world maybe these rioters

132
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,260
were out in the streets and basically
there's somebody inside they got through

133
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:54,670
and through their cellphone smartphone
ended up with some server somewhere and

134
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,949
activate something or one of the other
big things was the fact that not only

135
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:06,949
websites on the apps but I jumbotron
what if somebody sitting in the stadium

136
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:15,800
clips in a new card and has already
produced preactivated been in the

137
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:22,589
stadium for a year and just waiting for
command control to pop up and next thing

138
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:30,029
you know just before halftime I just
pops up I demand X-ers this guy gets its

139
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:41,819
ok now what is it doable you best do
things go in server farms are they so

140
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:50,290
things like that were talked about IP
harvesting what a great place to find

141
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,719
new IP addresses just sit there in a few
top to the right spots in the wireless

142
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,980
you got a whole bunch of new IP
addresses to former

143
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,270
obviously the point of sale stuff so
everybody when they're scanning and

144
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,400
going through the gate successor all
that's being check we are not part of

145
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,459
that piece but that's an obvious when
you have to do it again

146
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:17,130
the same new center and techniques going
on with that kind of detection

147
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,570
inspection fake tickets somebody come in
the next thing you know we're sitting

148
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,100
DHS would say out here we got somebody
with a bunch of fake tickets again that

149
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,090
kinda stuff so obviously there are there
but the chain of command of the

150
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:34,240
preparation prior to his what what do we
do if we see it and how do we hand out

151
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,630
so it's very well done I said ABT's
again

152
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,250
electric power grab one of the
individuals they are Santa Clara

153
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,339
actually does generate their own power

154
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:59,050
so how many people remember the Super
Bowl norman's why all the sudden prior

155
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,920
to the game they do test here

156
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:09,449
redundancy and shutdowns accepted
procedures etc so and recovery to pretty

157
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:15,779
good degree that happened ones hopefully
it won't again but again things are

158
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:22,300
changing so you do you have anybody
looking at the skaters protocols so

159
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:31,790
those are some of the other questions
that were get involved with the physical

160
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:37,079
layer stop the the surroundings and
everything is obviously becomes

161
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:45,029
redundant some of the fans for satellite
and so there's using and buy acts so

162
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:51,550
part of the reason you see that there
wasn't any problems with the dreamer

163
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,240
watching the game there's some evidence
seized are already there and so they're

164
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,929
well tested had taken care of and
they're obviously checked prior to the

165
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:06,579
game the interesting part that I kinda
surprised me is all of a sudden we come

166
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:11,489
in the morning and you get a guy like
that I'm 68 and also what teams and you

167
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:16,480
know it's it's new bunker in the start
rolling in large equipment that they

168
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,149
have surrounding this marker so you had
a number of different centers around

169
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:27,379
seven Cisco probably the country
watching the same time so there was one

170
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:34,730
right by the stadium it was then we're
about a mile away and one out of one of

171
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:39,439
the air force bases and couples or other
country but he's having a particular oil

172
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:44,630
and so that's the ground a piece in the
air

173
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:51,340
come about Thursday excuse me I think it
was Friday all the sudden if anybody's a

174
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:58,670
pilot so you know they need their space
so you look like an upside-down wedding

175
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:05,119
cake around so you have to be an
american commander in control and

176
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:13,310
communication with the tower sometimes a
control that became a huge huge seller

177
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:21,800
so anything passing that all had been
communications or there was a helicopter

178
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:30,300
on you but more so the command center
purposely blurred but we're all sitting

179
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,960
in a certain room and communication
happens and you know becomes a team

180
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,370
pretty quick so I was on the screen

181
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,680
the other thing is every day there's a
report or twice a day about what

182
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,720
happened either during the evening cuz
its 24 by 7 as well as now so that the

183
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,180
afternoon so there's a couple of effort
wide reports everybody tries to

184
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:58,000
communicate what happened once the team
members and so get a little bit of

185
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:07,400
collaboration so over the fans doing
well there's the numbers so a lot of

186
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,860
video and web browsing social media
sharing some music some messaging some

187
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:20,260
email navigation and other now there's
two ways to do it of course of course

188
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,090
things are gonna wifi but the cellular
network as well and we were not

189
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:29,820
investigated so but there was other
people that work so again all looking

190
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,820
for various types of hyperactivity

191
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:40,180
so putting this in perspective just two
years ago at MetLife there was one

192
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:49,380
terabyte ub40 oversee Phoenix there were
6 terabytes of WiFi the interesting

193
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:58,160
number to me becomes the 25,000 so
roughly a third is on at any point I'm

194
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:10,390
on the wifi and cellular so there were
17,000 at peak users and seven terabytes

195
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:16,740
of the wireless carrier not the wifi but
the wireless so Cisco we had 10

196
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,260
terabytes going through and crap

197
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,270
rates extremely high wifi get pushing
after doing it and then just between

198
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:33,250
sunday game day there was nine terabytes
alone and again

199
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,730
27,000 unique people are always on the
wifi during the game

200
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:46,800
what the average was 15 terabytes of
data and wireless but you start saying

201
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,250
we're starting to do more live streaming
consumed a lot more and you'll see more

202
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,250
about

203
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,820
get some perspective the average 49er
game generates about 2 terabytes

204
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,770
I forget exactly what their average
attendances filling it up so

205
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:15,560
WrestleMania who woulda guessed
WrestleMania withdrawal trust 78,000

206
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:22,840
people in the stadium ok and that was
for half terabytes now there's the

207
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,419
average

208
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:33,530
comparison is about four and a half
terabytes for standard 49ers game and

209
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:40,060
continuous data except Taylor Swift who
woulda guessed to me that much to go

210
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:48,980
through a concert while chairing there
are going through so what happens if

211
00:20:48,980 --> 00:21:03,460
somebody uses that so what we learn a
couple things to set this up we started

212
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,770
to our particular case and others did at
other times 24 would first of December

213
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:11,379
so we monitored all the way through the
gate and that whole time even after a

214
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,680
cyber penetration and cyber

215
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:21,460
shake down a couple weeks prior which
was professionally done we still fun 24

216
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:26,160
million cyber threats that can be a
paying an odd pink and communication are

217
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,200
not country and I communication it
shouldn't have been there for sauna room

218
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,860
and things like that but the attributes
so every one of those attributes ok and

219
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,629
I know that there was nineteen million
that happened from the wired network the

220
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:51,520
rest came from the wire this broken down
3.8 now an ARCA particular case one of

221
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,200
the reasons we were selected because of
the energetics and I did that just but

222
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,010
analytics we say our engine that means
we inspect all of the individual had

223
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,470
taken feeds from all the downside
prevents

224
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,740
honey pot that projects sands seabees
you name it

225
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:15,620
ok so we update that all the time but
things that were polymorphic rapid

226
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:23,830
change during 560,000 that's not all
they may be next minute or three months

227
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:29,070
well who knows but that point time they
weren't and that's how things are going

228
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:35,720
through there's no signatures was no
definitions you know there's no name for

229
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:45,860
it so the gamed day from 6 a.m. to 10
wiews 9.3 types of terabytes of data

230
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:52,080
between then we break it down in the
severity of the cyber events so one is

231
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,210
you are definitely being attacked

232
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,110
number two you're being attacked but
they don't have what your you don't have

233
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,399
what you're looking for

234
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,230
so you might have a might be in SQL
injection but he had a db2 database

235
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:10,020
something like that so but it still
attack and then of course three asthma

236
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,020
could be mostly just a reconnaissance

237
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:20,490
so what we had covered at all this
traffic is obviously see in command

238
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,010
control and I talked about but if you
look at what some of these the

239
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:29,710
BitTorrent look at or I didn't put in
the exact numbers we've gotta but then

240
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,560
expose a lot of this at some point we
can but there's a lot of traffic on to

241
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:41,240
tour now that could be good or bad what
if your foreign reporter and you're in

242
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,770
the us- or you have it so there's some
competition among supporters but his

243
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:54,379
budget in the same maybe they're using
that to stay so that nobody really

244
00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:01,340
season so that's a good sign

245
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:08,720
tour started by the USNavy years ago so
now so you have to figure that out yet

246
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,180
to see if that's good or bad that's
where delegates can come in but all the

247
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:21,030
other pieces it's all kind of about
getting around things right I don't want

248
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:28,460
to be caught even Thunder nation under
network a lot more but clean transaction

249
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,820
was going on there

250
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:39,320
our plate of all things trying to do
that so we found a lot of user agent

251
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,840
based viruses executables you know be no
surprise

252
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:52,460
DNS poisoning tragedy in essence a lot
of

253
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:59,620
back doors they're trying they were
going on couple of neat things clear

254
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:04,389
text to a lot of clear tech stuff going
on which was really kind of surprising

255
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:10,370
inappropriate websites people were
trying to deface and things like that

256
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:17,959
but the sexting 12 guess so here we are
looking at going ok to people doing that

257
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:27,129
inside the stadium and there was some
decrypt it but at first glance to say

258
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:34,510
okay so we set it up two hrs but if you
think about it what if what if someone

259
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:39,490
was saying I had this text message it's
all gone bad stuff on it and it's going

260
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:48,040
to your family unless you give me less
you give me codes to the server row

261
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,940
unless you give me passwords give me
your pass oars all those kind of things

262
00:25:52,940 --> 00:26:02,460
also possible so they test other
agencies took that and ran it up so

263
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:11,220
prior to the game we actually found two
servers that were hacked again we were

264
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,400
not allowed to do the automation be so
we can stop it back so they took a

265
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:22,390
barfly put the tourney game there was 21
that was actually done that way and so

266
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,390
that was another redundant failover
thing that happened during the game

267
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:34,320
next so that's just about the traffic
and again the stats what I want to share

268
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,980
is that what's interesting is that when
you watch the wireless side you would

269
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,159
think you just continue to climb climb
climb throughout the game and eventually

270
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,260
started going down after halftime but
what you'd find some micro spikes

271
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:53,340
brought out a bit if you are sitting in
the game and all of a sudden touched out

272
00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:04,080
everybody goes to touch down right now
so it follows user behavior in a lot of

273
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,510
cases which we didn't suspect I guess we
should have known that would just happen

274
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:15,610
but seems relevant so anyway and then as
time went on things went down because

275
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:20,750
they're gonna catch the criminals are
gonna get in beforehand or or you know

276
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:33,640
we're frustrated couldn't get in so they
just want so what do we learn I was

277
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:44,520
looking at 10 gigs earlier in the week
so if you can imagine the speed that

278
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,370
we're gonna be forced to take a look at
that probably say prices as as multi

279
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,370
terabytes today

280
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:59,610
you gonna be points where you're just
not gonna be able to wait a whole time

281
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,219
and I wasn't that the other pieces I
don't think we're going to be able to

282
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:08,290
have any tools to be able to enhance
your cyber security team is not

283
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:12,350
replacing a team by any means but you're
gonna have to have something that pulls

284
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:16,629
it out to be extremely accurate so that
they can if need be

285
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:21,570
drill down into a frenzy learn about it
but if you don't catch it it's gonna sit

286
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:27,220
there and if you don't catch it later be
an apt could be something else so at

287
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,190
these speeds were tripping out now it's
very difficult just look at Target

288
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:40,330
turned 50 people house 220 million
dollars took two hours to give notice

289
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:47,760
but they gave notice but still 22 are
staying figured out so as we go and time

290
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,610
again have to compresses times for
getting not await a response to the

291
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:57,370
other piece to its gonna have to be
extremely accurate so far I emphasized

292
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:03,590
in this is the prior to the game prior
to anything I network is to make sure

293
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:08,110
that you understand every aspect so if
you want to write a check maybe that

294
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,740
particular server over here is not
really communicating through your

295
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:19,790
devices all of sudden communicating
elsewhere so constantly constantly make

296
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:24,178
sure that the communication past or go
to where you want them to go on to go

297
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:35,349
and greater emphasis on that experience
there's no other way there's a people

298
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:38,879
now that was that the media thickness
you're gonna sit there and watch the

299
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,059
game you're going to go on like this

300
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:43,099
NFL streaming radio now what

301
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:51,629
by the way and is anybody watching video
you have to watch video

302
00:29:52,129 --> 00:29:55,218
another another piece to dr.

303
00:29:55,739 --> 00:30:03,609
more apps even bizarre that you may not
think of that each team each time the

304
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:06,499
Super Bowl goes around what they're
doing in Houston eventually Minneapolis

305
00:30:06,499 --> 00:30:10,039
in two years you know they're adding
adding addict for the user experience

306
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:14,079
and that's really what's driving the
whole concept of user experience but now

307
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,418
when you go to a concert and I never
thought about that crowd you go to the

308
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:24,029
park go to Taylor Swift you know you'd
like to dim the lights next thing you

309
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:30,259
got nothing but flashes going on you
know you tweeting facing everything else

310
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:37,639
so that may be ok but some of it may not
be so it's gonna have to be some

311
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:46,458
inspection pieces that will probably
never had to think of people and that's

312
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:52,029
really where the surface attacks video
the absence cells by sitting in a

313
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:57,169
booster articles are now we see where
the app stores both Microsoft and Google

314
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:04,329
Apps and others now we're sitting there
so even if it's a nap we don't know at

315
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,479
this speed those are gonna have to be
inspected then you Adam for particular

316
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:12,719
certain situations and next thing also
says it's free and then seeing the the

317
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:19,190
directions and everything else going on
with that or the 50 lines of code that

318
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,420
happened to be sitting there that

319
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:27,550
should have been caught it takes about
30 mins ago did detective ASM bucks to

320
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:39,159
be detected more automation is one of my
things that keep harping on my guess is

321
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,140
afraid of but ask the tough questions so
you understand it because the big data

322
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,910
and analytic pieces it's not all the
same you know give you example and I'd

323
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:54,130
done this for a long time and it's
really about the marketing terms versus

324
00:31:54,130 --> 00:32:00,740
the reality how many people here for a
deep packet inspection everybody should

325
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,390
raise your hand its most overused word
there is right

326
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:17,360
ok how deep is deep and i know im
driving as they may ask what do you look

327
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,189
at or is it just looking at the headers
what are the things that you're looking

328
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,080
for

329
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,909
that's what we were pre-planning we
start to look at what sensors do you

330
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,100
have what are you looking for how do I
know this particular timing protocol

331
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,159
etcetera

332
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:39,140
can you can you decrypt pls can you
decrypt HDDs those type of things so

333
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,940
getting to know those sensors to what
they can do and that's a deeper

334
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:49,140
questions how many protocols you have so
those things are going to be the

335
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,590
conversation going forward not just have
a firewall I just have ideas not just I

336
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,570
have a V not just have web application
firewall because everyone was designed

337
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:05,000
to do something all seven layers at the
right obviously a huge step forward but

338
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,890
the next is ok what are they really
looking so how deep is deep

339
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:15,710
was not because I understand and that's
what we went through and one of the

340
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:28,260
lessons learned so that was a generic
example room huge experience and we're

341
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,420
pretty fortunate feel very lucky to be
able to be selected loss of experience

342
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:50,890
that came with it and we never take that
way we have any questions thank you for

343
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,180
your time

344
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,550
time thank you for joining us if you
have any questions going forward
