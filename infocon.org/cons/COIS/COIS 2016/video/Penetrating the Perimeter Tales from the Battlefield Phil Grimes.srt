1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,610
system to let me in so we're just gonna
try to walk right through the front door

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:11,969
and that's exactly what I did so I
started from the car walked across the

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,000
parking lot walked across the street my
time did you know with a group of

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,180
employees I get my cell phone now and I
pretend like I'm talking on the phone as

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,189
I approached the door and they're not
paying me any attention you know here it

6
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:29,490
is just after lunch in there they're
heading back in nineteen not noticing

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,110
the big ugly I pacing on the cell phone
just steps from the door and when they

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,950
had one guy box up punches his coat hold
it open and let's let's the group in 20

9
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:46,910
followed right behind now once I was
inside I had no clue where to go I never

10
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,218
been in this building to shore but I
kept on my cell phone and pretended like

11
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,750
I knew exactly where I was going and as
I walked I was kinda checking around

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,620
casing the joint so to speak and I
notice that the receptionist the dead in

13
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,670
the middle of the lobby she saw me she
knew something was wrong because we made

14
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,530
eye contact for that split second her
eyebrow cocked a little bit I could tell

15
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,570
that she wanted to say something but the
lady was so sweet to not interrupt my

16
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,189
seemingly so important phone
conversation she let me go right on by

17
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,339
and before I knew it I was here we are
less than seven minutes from the time I

18
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,930
stepped out of my car and now I'm
already inside in a restricted area and

19
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,920
we're we bypassed the gatekeeper and the
receptionist

20
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,670
when I wandered around a little further
basically was able to tailgate anybody

21
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,840
into the restricted areas that they had
and again it was just these little push

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,259
button locks yeah I thought was really
kind of odd but while I was wandering

23
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:53,049
around found my way to their call center
and they were having a potluck for lunch

24
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:58,729
so i sat down and got myself some food I
had a chance to eat yet there were a few

25
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:01,890
of them that we're still taking
advantage of the long afternoon the

26
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,850
potluck luncheon while I was eating I
joining conversation I mean I'm trying

27
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,008
to give them a chance to say hey you
know something's not right here nobody

28
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:13,529
said a thing in fact I got caught up I
hadn't even seen Game of Thrones to that

29
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,819
point I got caught up on some really
cool TV and turning me on to the series

30
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:24,780
I'm kind of addicted to now so I was
able to wander the entire building and

31
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,660
one of the things that I found weird was
that in the elevator everything seemed

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:36,459
to be open except for the top floor
which the elevator had a bad reader RFID

33
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:41,900
bad reader and a Surrey Road really
weird place for this and as I was

34
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,550
watching every once in a while an empty
suit would get into the elevator and I'd

35
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,349
see him reach over and touch the bad
reader and head on up later that day I

36
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:53,599
found out this was actually the
executive level that all the executive

37
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,640
offices up on the top floor and that was
the only place that seem to be

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,429
restricted by any technical controls so
wandering the building a little bit more

39
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,260
that afternoon the stairwell and it was
really weird to me because I made it all

40
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,510
the way up to the top of the stairwell
door was not locked not bad I was on the

41
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,409
executive level bypass the elevator and
walked right through the door

42
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:26,140
exploring a little more through the
close on this executive floor I found

43
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,599
there was an empty office in the corner
and so I just kind of slid my way into

44
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:35,018
observed just see what was happening and
nobody bothered me I said with the

45
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:41,180
lights on I just kinda SAT in the chair
listening watching after Mauer i plug my

46
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,760
laptop inside let's see what we can
touch with cheering you know what can we

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,379
see on the internal network from the
lower level of access that I had to this

48
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,769
point

49
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:56,560
but it's just interesting to me that I
was able to sit there for most of the

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,550
day I'm exhausted in this office when I
would get up and walk out people saw me

51
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,190
several times walking out of a dark
office nobody said a thing I was able to

52
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:12,780
roam the building for the rest of the
day and by the by the end of the day

53
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,649
nobody nobody bothered me so I said ok
we're gonna take all this awash we're

54
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,779
gonna come back tomorrow and see what
happens

55
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:26,840
well as I was walking out on seeing an
empty office and I thought well you know

56
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,869
I mean I've been interested parties
should probably call when notified of a

57
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:36,610
breach so as I'm walking past the CEO's
office ICO look let's go ahead and we

58
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,310
just Maxim buttons and I figured out how
to dial in internal extension at which

59
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:48,780
point I called and I said to my site
contact a few been breached oh and by

60
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:55,460
the way I'm calling you from an office
upstairs now he's kind of childhood you

61
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,299
know he he he he laughs and started to
sob and we both kind of wish that we

62
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,050
could go for a shock for a minute there
but we decided we were going to talk a

63
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,930
little bit more and see you know how
long do we want to extend the assessment

64
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,600
for yes he wants me to come back
tomorrow but he said let's take it a

65
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,750
step further I want you to come back and
keep coming back until they catch you

66
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,050
let's see how long it takes for somebody
to respond this embargo you one better

67
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,170
let's see how long it takes for him to
respond and then let's dissect the

68
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:31,370
response afterwards and see if we can
help build on the internal processes so

69
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,750
as with all weeks Tuesday came I got
there again a little bit early trying to

70
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:42,050
stop my prey and I pulled into a
Starbucks just beside the target I

71
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,380
waited because those of you who knows
how it can be in any of the populated

72
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,569
places Worthington double in

73
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:52,949
dealing with Eastern traffic trying not
to be late that everybody shuffling in

74
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:56,889
pretty hurriedly and I was able to mix
myself in with the flow of traffic and

75
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,939
got ready and followed it followed the
group and I timed my approach again to

76
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:04,520
the building with this young employee
who was way too enthralled by what was

77
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,818
going on on her cellphone screen to
realize that there was some big giant

78
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,259
traveling behind her I mean I was only a
few paces ride so she knew she'd behind

79
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,119
her again trying to make people
uncomfortable followed her write-in

80
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:24,119
nobody said it wanted the building for a
little bit longer made my way back to

81
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:31,389
back up to I called I referred to in the
the deliverable report as my office was

82
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:35,209
able to wander around and still on the
cost of nowhere nobody bothered me so I

83
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:38,629
decided now you know I was gonna kiss
was my base for the rest of the time I

84
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:47,879
was here this office now was gonna be my
choice at around for a little while I

85
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:53,399
decided we're gonna we're going to
really step it up a little bit more so I

86
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,409
left to go out to lunch as I was walking
out I made friends with the couple of

87
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:06,659
employees walking down the stairs and i
join them for lunch now after the meal

88
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:11,360
I've made first-name basis with some of
these people taken on the personality of

89
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,449
Jake not from State Farm ejection mighty
who is much less hideous let me say and

90
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:21,249
when I came back from lunch I was
wondering all through the call center

91
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:26,069
wondering also the executive level 1
during the entire building putting hands

92
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:30,839
on hardware talking to people you know I
was usually guy is a virus cataloging

93
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,079
asset tags that I needed to see you make
sure that we had all of our equipment

94
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,669
where it was supposed to be nobody asked
the second thing about it and then i'd I

95
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,969
wanted to go a little further and get
them hey would you mind sending an email

96
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:43,909
for me

97
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:48,709
hey would you mind here that hit the
start button brief run the command

98
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:53,159
prompt and type in these for these
commands no questions asked

99
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:57,789
didn't bat an eye I had no I D didn't
ask for a business card nobody had seen

100
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:03,748
me before and I i still am able now to
have not only made modifications myself

101
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:07,229
by putting my militias USB into this
these machines but I could have

102
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:14,068
legitimate employees taking action for
me without even asking a question and I

103
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:19,490
mention the little USB thing we had we
had a set to be able to just pop a

104
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,149
command prompt again I wanted to let
them know that something was happening

105
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:30,249
so it auto played the command prompt and
went away still no no no nothing and

106
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:34,689
then it would probably she'll back to my
my machine waiting up on the executive

107
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:44,430
level so that I could get a foothold by
the time I got there Wednesday my

108
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,069
friends from lunch the day before

109
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:49,910
recognize me as I was getting a lot and
we had a nice conversation as we were

110
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:57,569
walking in nobody really seem to notice
that I was a stranger at least that's

111
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:01,740
that's what I thought I was able to walk
in an hour spent time in my office

112
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,170
roaming around you know the walking the
entire building they were doing some

113
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,110
construction which was you know after
the fact this was kind of the that the

114
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:14,089
reason why they said nobody saw me cause
I'm look like a construction worker

115
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:17,620
apparently even though I don't know
construction workers address like this

116
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,930
but I look like a construction worker so
nobody bothered me but that would let

117
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,870
let me move some materials around I
actually even put some hands-on

118
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,740
disconnected machines I coulda walked
right out with these these machines that

119
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,370
were going down for decommissioning and
nobody ever knew I drown the data center

120
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,449
which was protected by locking Chiefs
anybody in here use locking key anymore

121
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:44,508
for the data center now well needless to
say that proved very effective against

122
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:45,630
my lock picks

123
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:50,580
and even less effective against the the
trio's or duos of employees that would

124
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,360
come and go unlock the door

125
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,240
given out at will do whatever they need
to do and then they leave again to stand

126
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,820
by the door for about an hour and a half
and walked in and out of the data center

127
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:11,810
four times being able to just tailgate
somebody nobody said do nobody nobody

128
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,770
stopped to question me nobody asked who
I was where I was going why I was there

129
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:22,970
but everybody was so nice they are said
hello when we passed a doll smile see

130
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,360
people are are they want to help they
want to be happy they want to be

131
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,390
friendly but they don't want especially
somebody like me who's gonna stop me and

132
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,000
say hey who are you where are you going

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,070
hopefully you can answer everyone in
your organization would and if you can't

134
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,100
this is why I'm here talking about it
today because yes I love breaking into

135
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,970
these things I love being able to test
the perimeter to be able to find

136
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:54,880
weaknesses in physical controls but what
what do we do I mean if they if they are

137
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,200
really being effective how do we know
what's the point of them anyway so

138
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,620
wandering around again nobody nobody
bothers me I had hands all over the

139
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,180
machines I pictures of me in the data
center pictures of me at the CEO's

140
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,709
office while he's eating his lunch and
working I have pictures of me under

141
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:21,480
security cameras faces and nobody nobody
bothers I'm hoping somebody is going to

142
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,480
respond and I get nothing

143
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:30,760
so the end of the day about four o'clock
or so in people the people start

144
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,860
shuffling hour and as I'm as I'm walkin
our I get so great to see you I'm Alex

145
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,130
who are you say hey Alex I'm day forward
how how are you nice to meet you

146
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,220
sometime I'm great I just wanted to know
who's team are you on what are you

147
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,960
working on Salix I'm on my team whose
team are you on

148
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:55,040
he said oh no I'm just curious because
we had a couple of complaints some of

149
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,089
this some of the females who said that
Iran you've been following him and made

150
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:04,730
him little uncomfortable now we know
somebody is saying something the

151
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,220
question is when did they first say
something and be how long did it take

152
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,680
him to say something to me had this man
in a worst-case scenario the fallout to

153
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,199
this point could have been quite hectic
so me doing the dance that I always do

154
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,870
you know I told him I'm just here doing
some work for steve did go to go talk to

155
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:28,150
Steven he'll be able to tell you
everything is going on well there is no

156
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:34,150
Steve but he said let's go get your
badge Sandusky said I don't need a bad

157
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,020
trip what I'm here for you go talk to
Steven and if you want to give me a bad

158
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,000
removal go do that so he turns around
and walks away I don't know where this

159
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,610
guy's going there is no Steve

160
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:48,330
where you go who Steve well as soon as
he was out of my line of sight I made a

161
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:54,790
beeline for the door she later I made my
exit and no badge to be had I don't know

162
00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:03,020
if you ever found Steve but hopefully it
wasn't like Where's Waldo so this is my

163
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,730
favorite part on thursday we get to come
back right I miss the slide that was

164
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,990
supposed to be that one so my my cover
at this point I considered it to be

165
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,990
blown right I probably could have pushed
my luck a little bit more we probably

166
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,470
could have kept the assessment going I
could have played hide-and-seek from

167
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,370
Steve the way I had

168
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,240
from from Alex had been the other people
as I've been I mean I got an expert

169
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,650
hiding in the bathrooms and all over the
place this week but first they came and

170
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:37,829
we we decided it was time to do the our
brief it was time to explain everything

171
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:44,250
that we did it is time to funnel through
the not so small stack of findings so I

172
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,529
set the appointment with my contacts for
just after lunch and as I walked in

173
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,860
by this time checking in wasn't even if
I just walked right past the

174
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,770
receptionist and walked on up and still
nobody said a thing you know and as I'm

175
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,760
getting ready to head to the stairwell
to go to the Executive Office I hear the

176
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,390
ding in the elevator and I hear hey days
turnaround remember I was Jake from

177
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,610
State Farm but I used a little bit too
just to kind of see what was what it was

178
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:19,110
that was not found out Alex was actually
the security manager were talking

179
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,089
tremendous great to see you thanks for
coming back are you going to meeting up

180
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:29,140
upon the foursome go talk to the board
here take the elevator / his card on

181
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:42,069
sends me right up again no badge no I D
not even my real name thanks Alex so the

182
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:48,410
idea here is you know we need to we need
to be thinking a little bit differently

183
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:54,709
we need to be trying to again engage the
users we need to realize that you've got

184
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:59,050
controls available but we're not tapping
one of our greatest resources and that

185
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:04,650
is to to hire and billed to the
corporate culture that we need to

186
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:10,250
propagate and that's one of the people
who are as invested in their positions

187
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,770
as each of us are in ours now I know
this opens up a whole other can of worms

188
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:18,990
and hiring hiring side right about how
do we hire somebody that's gonna

189
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,920
actually do the right thing how we gonna

190
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,689
people who want to be good digital
citizens we need to start trying to

191
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:31,550
equate how good behavior doesn't stop at
work

192
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,579
good digital behavior being a good
online citizen is something that we

193
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:42,069
should be doing every day on Facebook
and email on Twitter and everywhere we

194
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:47,440
need to be getting people to realize
that their actions their habits spill

195
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,730
over into every every walk of their
lives especially when we're talking

196
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,430
digitally because there's so much that
we all rely on I bet there's not a one

197
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,939
of us in here right now it doesn't have
a smartphone in our pocket or a tablet

198
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:06,230
or a laptop or a combination of the
three but by working to propagate a

199
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:11,079
culture that's that's getting people who
want to buy into doing the right thing

200
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:16,550
really isn't going to be that hard if we
can work to change it from the ground up

201
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,740
and that is by teaching our kids
teaching our students I've got one of my

202
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,910
the inaugural cyber patriot members of
my team is actually here with us today

203
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:32,019
being able to see each inch you want to
do better in in their own behavior and

204
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:35,570
possibly go on to build build a career
out of it or a very least in whatever

205
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:41,079
Wako isolationism whatever work they
decide to do we may get a small fraction

206
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:44,969
of them to think a I remember that I
shouldn't set my password to password

207
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:51,399
1234 hey maybe I should change my
password more than once every never

208
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:59,230
hey maybe I ought not use the same
password for everything because we all

209
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:05,589
know that that's still happening we need
to stop thinking that it

210
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:10,020
isn't gonna happen to us if you haven't
been breached if you aren't being

211
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,939
breached right now you will be don't we
want to use that the asset of our best

212
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:21,449
IDs the best IPS that we have our people
and get them thinking about these things

213
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:24,650
a little bit differently so that when
that command prompt pops up on the

214
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,260
screen that they say hey I don't know
what you just did there but it's make it

215
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,370
did something different to my machine
question what's different

216
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,918
start looking to make the users feel
invested

217
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:42,600
we might seem done a lot with user
awareness and trying to build bring

218
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,840
these programs to the corporate culture
trying to build a program from the

219
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:53,879
ground up that takes actual data from
your organization and is able to pull

220
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,490
that into a program that helps make your
users do a little bit better and it

221
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:03,460
gives us or you the organization the
power by which to show metrics that

222
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,799
either they're doing better doing were
sent it to build coaching along with

223
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,110
those but it's it's finding the people
who are willing to see the value in

224
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:21,959
making these changes that we need to be
need to be looking for I know it's a lot

225
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:28,230
to ask but this IBM cost today to brief
study shows that it might be an

226
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:34,049
expensive investment sure to take time
out of productivity to get your users

227
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:38,090
together and to start talking about why
you shouldn't click on the on the

228
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:43,470
tracking snowman you know these things
matter and they just don't think about

229
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,020
it because a lot of times if if i'm
looking on Facebook and I see it working

230
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,908
snowman I want to know why so happy and
I'm gonna click on it but we have to be

231
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:56,909
fighting these battles every day making
making the people realize that you know

232
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:01,390
it's just a snowman and most likely
there something dangerous behind it and

233
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,210
if there's not been be looking for the
anomalies by which you know to to say

234
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:18,059
hey something's different here so that I
want to try and keep on the schedule was

235
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,070
able to burn through that a little bit
quicker so if there's anything that we

236
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,899
want to talk and questions that I can
answer I'd like to take those now

237
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:46,699
attempt during day one of the attack so
again I went with our sheets prepared

238
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,730
for everything and I didn't know what to
expect because of the nature of the

239
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:56,460
beast I showed up with a suit and tie
but as the day progressed about a half

240
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,000
hour into it I realized everybody was
casual so I was able to change in my

241
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,899
vehicle I tried to assimilate to
whatever the culture seems to be at the

242
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:07,870
target those jeans and a t-shirt on day
one

243
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,129
been then dressed pretty much like this
for the days after because again I

244
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,460
wanted to kind of stand out a little bit
to give them to you especially once I

245
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,200
heard that I look like the construction
worker you know I didn't want to be

246
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,080
jeans and a t-shirt and have somebody
really thinking oh he's just he's

247
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,280
supposed to be here so is it was
basically like this after the fact

248
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,700
jeans and a t-shirt jeans and a t-shirt
and nobody something

249
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:49,799
the question is is the art gotten any
better I've been doing this for quite a

250
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:57,320
while both officially and not and and
yeah you know unfortunately overall it

251
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:04,860
hasn't you see some organizations are
starting to involve many most even go so

252
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,889
far as to say most are starting to
evolve but what what I find more often

253
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:15,159
than not as you wish spending all our
money on things and the blanket boxes

254
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:18,650
just aren't stopping us because I mean
at this point you know I was able to

255
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:38,650
walk in and modify machines walk out
with them so no documented reporting

256
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:45,309
process so most of them will have the
receptionist or what not right but they

257
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:48,789
don't have that even those the log books
they expect you to sign then they want

258
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:51,620
too bad you in or something like that
but those get shredded at the end of the

259
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,928
day they don't even really keep a
forensic log of who's coming and going

260
00:21:54,929 --> 00:22:01,020
let alone to be able to to keep to keep
130 cheap a lot of what that person is

261
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,470
doing inside another example of this is
actually won something I did just fairly

262
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,990
recently a huge campus right we're
talking to this is critical

263
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,299
infrastructure kind of thing she's
campus and they're like you know we

264
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:18,980
we've got gates we've got guards we've
got cameras everything it's great when I

265
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,890
get there and we're talking i mean a
place that's roughly the size of this

266
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:29,760
city block this campus right now had two
cameras two cameras one of which was

267
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,150
inside their warehouse and that was only
because they had some recently and

268
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,510
that's from their own people looking
around a little bit more when I went to

269
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:41,110
do a walk her a walk through the
perimeter I was floored to see i mean

270
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,758
we're out in the middle of nowhere

271
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:48,519
air right one camera protecting this
place no I are no motion detection no

272
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:53,129
lighting i mean when it goes dark
they're pretty much blind so no they're

273
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:57,678
not mean we don't even have we don't
even have valid physical controls let

274
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:19,199
alone valid response for detection when
it comes to physical stuff but not a

275
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:22,879
retest ninety-nine times out of ten yes
unless they're you know they're too

276

280
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:52,119

spend it on any controls that can keep

281
00:23:52,119 --> 00:24:10,399

time see how we will send the same just

283
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:20,718

problem is you sitting now you're

286
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:36,359
fighting an uphill battle here drinking
from the proverbial fire hose because

287
