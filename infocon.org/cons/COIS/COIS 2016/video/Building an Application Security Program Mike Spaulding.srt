1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
just real quickly I'll do an intro
myself I don't think I actually had a

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:11,750
good intro slide my name's mike spalla
I'm in doing this way too long I'm not

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,030
gonna sell you anything I don't care
what you buy you can buy whatever you

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:22,939
feel like I don't really care what you
buy you can do it by scratch so I do

5
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,070
security strategy architecture company
confidential

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:33,059
talk later we'll talk later it's a fun
place we gonna do need things always put

7
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,180
this disclaimer in even though this is a
pretty soft talk and in my opinion what

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,450
you do if your business is up to you
don't come back to me in three months I

9
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:49,640
got fired following your advice is that
why I had to meet friends hired three

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,449
friends it done things I think before
you act as though that's the general

11
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,129
theme here so what are we going after
here we're talking about building an

12
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:05,239
application security program my
perspective on this is not you know hey

13
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,010
I need to do sequel injection let's talk
about cross-site scripting we have

14
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,650
Google you can go find out all you want
to know about that my take on this is

15
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,979
how do I get a program up what do I need
to do to get people convinced and where

16
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:23,640
do I need to go to kind of get the
dollar's going but we think about it we

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,759
think about bad guys path of least
resistance you gotta remember when we

18
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,350
were thinking like the bad guy they're
going to launch an attack going on with

19
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,970
the next weakness in line to get a
violator control they're going to

20
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,130
deviate from some function and then boom
they're going up your data like

21
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,899
everybody here gets that I was put this
in here because what I'm hoping that you

22
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:48,850
could use this for is this flight deck
to commit your own management some of it

23
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,619
you might have to massage I've got like
my elevator pitch that I've made for the

24
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,689
whole plan of this is you'll be able to
use this so hopefully commit your own

25
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:58,689
management to application security

26
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:05,929
there we go you have to throw that in
there

27
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,880
the business doesn't get the last you
like why do I care about application

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,970
security or why do I care about security
in general

29
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:19,520
well this is generally how they work
their way through the system so when we

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,970
think about it we've all seen this
before anybody knew the top 10 used to

31
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,540
call the the seven deadly sins

32
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,350
it's evolved over the years right lots
of different ways people look at it but

33
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,890
we give we've got these vulnerabilities
out there what do people attack is a

34
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,630
tack everything from IOT the vehicles
you name it they're attacking why not

35
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,010
well think about it

36
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,660
got a web server why not attack it you
know back in the day when I was back at

37
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,480
Chase we used to go in and actually
change each other's names on the phones

38
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,320
so that when people call it would come
up with some up seen a man in your boss

39
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,480
you call your boss at the subsea name
your bosses like why are you calling me

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,190
with the subsea name so we get each
other into trouble little bit did the

41
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,410
same thing with pagers all that type of
stuff was all web based we went to a web

42
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,070
service was wide open and we just mess
with each other well now everything has

43
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:21,600
it was alright so this is a slight I
want to point out that i think is

44
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,500
absolutely critical

45
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,989
the goal of application security is a
reduced risk it will never get you two

46
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,160
point zero you'll never be completely
nowhere now why is that important

47
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,900
a lot of people sell this as their
solution as being 80 we guarantee wrist

48
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,769
nobody can guarantee you that your your
risk going away but at the same time you

49
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,769
gotta convince your management to spend
X amount of money

50
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,230
ok I want to get to point B on this
graph if I get the point you know if I

51
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,660
look on here I look at point B I'm
spending a lot of money and yeah I'm

52
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,640
reducing my wrists down to some
low-level over here you look at the

53
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,239
bottom right there on

54
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,420
in the red but is to a level that
essentially they're probably not going

55
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,609
to be ok with now if you're with the NSA
area with somebody who basically money

56
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:19,239
is no option go all the way down to D
nobody's gonna care nobody's gonna care

57
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:23,780
what you spent right that's actually how
they sell you to go to the NSA come to

58
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,000
the NSA guess what kind of get unlimited
budget will certainly have a lot of fun

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,020
we just won't pay you all so most places
what they're looking to achieve looking

60
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,690
to achieve they want to reduce the risk
down to a manageable level where they

61
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,130
can afford it that's really where you're
shooting for you can't spend any amount

62
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,480
of dollars to essentially drive
everything you know to this insane

63
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,000
amount of spending most companies don't
have it even the company I work for an

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,540
hour the global 50 company trying to get
them to create an application security

65
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:05,060
program challenge ok it seems simple but
trust me you think about scope creep

66
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,700
it'll destroy any program

67
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,700
Pixar River night it's it's incredible

68
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,160
we're talking about a couple of basic
some of you may know these last speaker

69
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,160
is he like he was talking a combination
of kind of both of these things together

70
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,900
I'm actually ironically gonna talk about
security automation but I'm gonna

71
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,340
completely do it from a different
perspective in Baltimore so anyhow

72
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,690
dynamic assessments down access but
we're going through that it's important

73
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,490
to enter to know the difference we have
security and fantastic I can't tell you

74
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,930
how many times even vendors that sell
this stuff don't differentiate between

75
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,670
those two they try to sell you pen
testing but there and application

76
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,560
security vendor and they they start
pulling

77
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,580
learning lines really bad along with
vulnerability management I see those

78
00:05:50,580 --> 00:06:00,750
three spaces constantly getting abused
their console getting just how to

79
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,530
describe it I just use such bleed over
between the three programs that at the

80
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:05,880
end

81
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,310
everyone's talking this poor language
and nobody really knows what the hell

82
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,840
he's right

83
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,900
so static analysis of ICO testing this
is the stuff that you know fuhrman

84
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,010
automation perspective I used to
automate I still would prefer to

85
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,669
automate at the same time I will
emphasize and I'll disagree with the

86
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:28,539
previous speaker I don't like the

87
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,820
get into the speakers but to me this is
important enough that I would train my

88
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:44,530
developers to write better code that's
just my own perspective yes I will take

89
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,520
it easier that way we can knock him out
and if we run out of time about the

90
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,120
hallway but the thing is is that I guess
to me

91
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,310
Dholpur importance of training is the
fact that you have it and and the

92
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,630
developers need to know how to correct
themselves if I just let the developers

93
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,530
to make the same mistakes to have his
I'm gonna have the same quality product

94
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,349
over and over again

95
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,750
reinventing the wheel will talk about
that a little later on it from a

96
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:19,270
perspective of kinda weird throw that in
there but when I think about you know

97
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,180
static analysis I think about sanitizing
the data input from an end user's

98
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,240
perspective it's critical

99
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,900
restricted to the data input the greater
the opportunity for views i cant put the

100
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,739
little red things at the bottom right
now is like the gist of what we're going

101
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,400
after the big day I would say from a
static analysis perspective development

102
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,250
perspective the cleaner I can get the
data input that the better I can

103
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,229
sanitize that generally speaking the
fewer headaches I have now it's not a

104
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:48,810
guaranteed you know it's always gonna
work that way but it does cut my

105
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,690
headaches down a lot if you get a good
good set of developers overtime realizes

106
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,710
will start to coding towards your way
and eventually that's kind of where

107
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,239
you're trying to go towards you become
like all the Maytag repairman you run

108
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,110
your assessments and your broader mine
is your like this is just not fun

109
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:12,530
anymore actually while the company once
so dynamic analysis what we all think

110
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:19,710
about the fun stuff this is where I like
you know i'm happier laughing at me you

111
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,900
know the dynamic analysis is where I get
to go up against the website to beat up

112
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,340
on it

113
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,880
you know I'll go ahead and I'll try to
do my secret injection I'll try to do my

114
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,010
you know my cross site scripting and and
in trying to explain that developers III

115
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,979
designs find is one of the most
difficult challenges like wheelchairs

116
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,479
just cause they were stripping who cares

117
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,200
try to explain its management it's just
pointless they they they usually don't

118
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,680
even know what the name put feel so this
is this is usually the glamorous side of

119
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,069
the of the I'm gonna be doing some
security testing culture it's important

120
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,560
but at the same time it's not the end
all be all

121
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,529
oftentimes again this is automated a lot
of people will go out there and on this

122
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:07,700
and say hey there you go

123
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,630
here's your assessment and hand it to
you and you'll go I could have done that

124
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,339
in fact we had a fifteen year old one of
the places where you so we're doing just

125
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:25,060
that it's not really that art here's an
intern not a hard thing to do so when I

126
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,660
think about the components of a sack I
think about web applications I think

127
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,829
about the client-server apps a lot of
people forget about clients are perhaps

128
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,000
it's amazing just because of the fact
that the web is where it is

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,190
doesn't mean I have to neglect my client
server application there are tools sets

130
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:46,970
out there to answer apps it's a little
more infrequent but they do exist also

131
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,990
my mobile apps by middleware and a type
of cryptographic analysis that's kind of

132
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,110
my general catch-all for network

133
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,610
shipping certain traffic over the
network at least your IDs and passwords

134
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:03,330
but you gotta look at that type of stuff
all this kind of things kind of roll

135
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:10,060
into what I would call an application
security ok vulnerability testing

136
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,689
ensures that no two components along
with the app when placed together not

137
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,300
create not-guilty so finally at the end
I take all this together I slept

138
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,099
together and i just make sure that I
haven't created a vulnerability that I

139
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:29,850
want unaware ok I get I wanna I wanna
hit throughout the stages so what all do

140
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,209
it that manual step is I'm gonna smoke
test to make that final product

141
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:37,618
has no anomalies I haven't I've
discovered as many things as I can

142
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:41,129
possibly find I'm willing to live with
it again I'm trying to get myself down

143
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:46,240
that deedrick we're trying to get myself
down at lowest point where I spend as

144
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,699
much money as I'm going to spin and I'm
going to let the product before so I'm

145
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:55,179
going through here and I'll try to beat
up on it I'll see what I can find

146
00:10:55,179 --> 00:11:03,679
manual testing is low but it's probably
the most important thing to me you can

147
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,470
automate static testing can automate the
dynamic stop but this is where I use

148
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,929
those findings to go through and to
actually validate whether they were used

149
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:16,800
for not today helped me out or not a lot
of people will again what they'll do is

150
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,209
a like well the developer and static
test that's nice

151
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,929
the intern ran the dynamic test again
that's nice but I need to go through and

152
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:29,369
actually have a human set of eyes look
at that material find out there some

153
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:33,449
pieces I put together to make something
that is really all against back to

154
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:43,439
alright guys and continuous improvement
why is this important essentially and

155
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:47,920
again I don't know about the the
previous speakers business model but my

156
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,748
take is that we want to put ourselves in
the position of becoming the Maytag

157
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:54,519
repairman if I do it right

158
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,420
my workload should decrease over time
and these guys know that i got really

159
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,990
bored it a number of different companies
for overtime because you get to a point

160
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:09,179
where the developers are are developing
nice tight code vulnerabilities aren't

161
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:15,480
being found not finding you really not
finding much is just boring so you're

162
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,420
doing a job that you really don't enjoy
anymore and maybe it's time that you

163
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,110
bring in some other talent to go ahead
and do that but i wanna keep going

164
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:28,699
through this whole process of PDCA plan
do check act ok this rehearsal process

165
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,579
of making myself get better

166
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:35,269
why because that's how you make things
are improving your environment I'm not

167
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:39,279
just gonna run security once and just
walk away from it that's the problem lot

168
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,040
of people think we got a security
program up and going yes but the bad guy

169
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,439
you know they're always going to that
next low

170
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:53,020
it's amazing it and even in my current
role i'm talking to people who were who

171
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,840
are like in nineteen nineties mindset
that's really what they were doing most

172
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,240
of the technical work that nineties
mindset and they're kinda like well you

173
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,880
know we're doing this we're doing this
I'm like that's great but the only bad

174
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,189
thing is all the bad guys they've
evolved

175
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,200
last 20 years they've moved themselves
up to this level will you guys stayed

176
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,620
right down here it's the truth but
security is a cat-and-mouse game they're

177
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,600
always up in the game so when I start
looking at this you know what will I go

178
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,350
after maybe I'll start with my annual
assessment of interfacing out so go

179
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:38,220
karts 20 apps yeah there's a critical of
my apps that contain PII PCI

180
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,100
intellectual property

181
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,790
anything with value addition of that ad
hoc assessments the whale kind of

182
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,339
structure it is I would go after a new
applications first I go after those ones

183
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,360
going through significant upgrades and I
get to my emerging technologies things

184
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,230
that are going through like a slight
upgrade I may not spend the effort to go

185
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,160
ahead and run my actual assessment yes
it's kind of pointless if the value

186
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,730
proposition news doesn't they're all the
while I'm doing this i doin it defines

187
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,920
the metrics ok because I need feedback I
can't tell you how many times I've seen

188
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,060
programs failed because they're not
showing and again it's just how the

189
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,959
business world worse they want to see
what ru improving upon what what are you

190
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,280
catching what are you finding they want
to see what am i spending you know what

191
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,160
happen million to a million dollars on
people don't put together metrics you

192
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,829
need to know what you're you're
essentially you're a pSET KPIs are and

193
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,839
that's actually a good discussion if
somebody wants to make one yet have a

194
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,950
good have an hour long talk on a pSET
KPI's ok but know what my KPIs are

195
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,070
normally metrics are and then make sure
that feedback kinda gets back put into

196
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,620
the loop if people know what's going on
so

197
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,050
variations to think about training as I
mentioned earlier trainer developers

198
00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:01,390
there's no point having them go through
this whole process just spinning wheel

199
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,600
over and over again

200
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,770
trainer developers go through the way I
used to do it at the second and third

201
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:14,310
most recent job was actually had like a
lead developer lead developer

202
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,360
clear coats on a weekly basis they would
go through an eight-run the automatic

203
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,510
scan through all the code he'd also you
know train more junior developers make

204
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:30,990
sure they were solid and essentially
over time they became valuable because

205
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,980
they actually crude develop secure code
and he's better security and people

206
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,210
found out about it they started stealing
other people's way but it's gonna be

207
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,880
this process where you're going to
constantly be trained people the

208
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,689
training never ends so create like that
lead type of program with your with your

209
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,120
developers but the same time make sure
that you know your staff has proper

210
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,800
training the bad guys are always you
know well trained because they have a

211
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,750
financial incentive to but go through
that from a staff and prospective make

212
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,470
sure that you have plenty of resources
operational security I do throw this in

213
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,050
there because a lot of people forget
about this application security is not a

214
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,000
substitute for a next-generation paper
file and I'm not here to sing you a

215
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,380
next-generation firewall I'm just trying
to tell you that again from a metric

216
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,740
perspective it would be good to see how
much kinda hits your front doorstep and

217
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,660
wire application security programs value
that's how you can basically address it

218
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,790
with your manager what you know why am I
doing this application security you know

219
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,770
program to begin with well look at the
metrics on the firewall look at all

220
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,970
these attacks that are concentrating our
boxes again

221
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:48,500
security is not a substitute for doing
their operations security data loss

222
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,180
prevention because if you really do data
loss prevention while you'll you'll see

223
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:57,239
where people are stealing stuff out from
underneath and infinitely better

224
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,160
management when you get to a point of
maturity within your application

225
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,609
security program or it can take a couple
another dive into this in a second but

226
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:08,020
when you think about dinner management
you know you're gonna get really bored

227
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,799
if you start doing this well if you
start setting up a team you're going

228
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,900
through this you're gonna want to
eventually go up your vendors why not

229
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,650
they have an obligation to essentially
delivered you a solid piece of software

230
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,669
and a lot of people are surprised to
find out that a lot of vendors don't do

231
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:30,270
any security testing surprise surprise
so from a vendor management perspective

232
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:35,900
you can become a mini consulting shop
you get to find out who is telling you

233
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,820
the truth on their testing and who's not

234
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,158
or who's got a bad bender for themselves

235
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:47,570
delivering this all talk and when we
talk about this weekend spent an hour on

236
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,289
this we could spend an entire day
talking about this little or just on how

237
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:57,110
to manage a team but we can't just
covered in probably three or four

238
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,610
minutes and that's about all we have
made me want to talk later on we can

239
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:09,199
talk about it so I actually stole this
from Chris Weiss apollo ok it was a good

240
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:16,150
little website or little posted put out
on dark reading but his steps are really

241
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:23,390
solid ok so start simple start small can
emphasize that enough to many people

242
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,450
like I've gotta sell my business the Taj
Mahal I gotta convince them to go spend

243
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,159
a million and a half on application
security doesn't work like that most

244
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,159
businesses want generally weigh their
way into it ok so

245
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,540
we talk about application security
you've got a circuit that by and I'll be

246
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,520
honest with you there's a lot of shit
don't get it

247
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,559
their lives as I was joking earlier I
personally don't want to work for

248
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,389
another says however again simply
because the fact that entire train

249
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,650
scissors

250
00:18:52,650 --> 00:19:00,440
application security is is something of
a lesser persons technical they're

251
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,770
probably not going to get it and explain
to them the very difficult past but you

252
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,190
gotta start small and you gotta start
with simple means of helping them

253
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:17,370
understand that the data loss ok so you
have to convince risk one of the

254
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,399
business

255
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,600
this is actually a good 12 also
emphasized the businesses out to salvage

256
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,699
its right they sell insurance they sell
your products they deliver health care

257
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,380
they do whatever it is they do various
few people in here probably actually

258
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:38,530
deliver security services unless you're
consultor vendor right your company is

259
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,770
to do whatever it is

260
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,650
people forget about that so you gotta
convince them why they gotta go spend a

261
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,799
half million dollars do something that
you want to do because it's gonna save

262
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:56,730
explains why you gotta build that value
proposition so how's he standard why

263
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:03,520
they matter really when you think about
it during the two early stages of any

264
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,410
type of development

265
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,100
getting a product definition system
overview if I haven't to define

266
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,689
application security well enough I'm
probably gonna live with the rest of the

267
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:19,470
the application process we're gonna get
the DLC here in a second but I've got it

268
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,120
got it

269
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,149
convey to people exactly what I'm
looking for and typically this is done

270
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,140
you know this is where I'm at an
architecture you want or some type of

271
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,710
early architecture of this is where I'm
gonna go through and defined what's

272
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,030
expected if the developers do not know
what is expected

273
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,460
they're going to deliver what they've
been told to deliver weather

274
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,949
whether you like it or not so now you're
you're essentially hoping I want to go

275
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,419
in there early on and i want to tell
them here's exactly what my expectations

276
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:53,850
are your code here is it that I'm
expecting to happen on a weekly basis a

277
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,850
monthly basis and at the end here's what
we're gonna do

278
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:02,440
ok your greatest ability to influence
any project starts at the very beginning

279
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,250
if you wait until the 11th hour and
tries to hit nasa we have a problem

280
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,690
getting them and to tell you sorry we
gotta go

281
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:19,419
groups unless you can prove something
very very bad why metrics matter from a

282
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:28,740
budget standpoint yet to show return on
investment that's why I gotta show an

283
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:37,720
ROI ROI nobody cares producers metrics
weekly monthly how often you can meet

284
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,500
with your management and help them
understand that even as a even as a

285
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:49,908
if anyone ever been laid off for a
couple people I have an idea right now

286
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:50,799
it sucks

287
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,690
okay and you know what the biggest
failure I had at the age of 26 of

288
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,500
getting laid off was that I was doing
all this great work in fact that was

289
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,909
helping other people on my team

290
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:07,780
problem was my management didn't see
just what happened they laid off the

291
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,590
golden goose the amount of money I was
making them they were they later on they

292
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,860
close up the whole line of business and
i was just because of me but because of

293
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,870
the fact that I wasn't conveying the
metrics to them to let them know exactly

294
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:26,780
what I was doing and and in the end I
screwed myself metrics kinda define

295
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,408
whether your valuable or not you have to
show it to him you have to constantly

296
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:39,659
let them know that so finally we need to
add a line apps apps equity or SDLC ok

297
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:44,929
so we all have seen this before design
build test deploy operate some familiar

298
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:45,429
County

299
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:48,490
generic universal enough alright

300
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:52,960
so what you'll see here is that I kind
of got this generic be defined right now

301
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,160
so I've got like Design I've got my like
architecture of you I'm gonna go through

302
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,990
an internal review and I set my
expectations in here at static testing

303
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,270
I'm gonna go through and make sure that
developers are at least doing some bit

304
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,100
of static testing make sure that I know
what's going on with their code where

305
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,570
they are they really keeping their
commitments and then finally when I get

306
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:16,250
towards that test deploy phase I would
you buy dynamic testing and then you can

307
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:22,130
eventually evolved to pen testing going
into other areas and as new versions

308
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,990
happened I come back and argue that plan
do check act a comeback 20 essentially

309
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:32,360
to the process all over my nose and
developers alike no not all of not doing

310
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,059
security all over again hopefully the
second time around a lot easier and

311
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:42,690
usually goes much more quickly so I

312
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,640
got these written out right here of
these steps UK steps one through six it

313
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:57,429
might be easier to go ahead and kind of
laid out on here right so you can only

314
00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:02,290
go through and you see that essentially
I'm in my early analysis architecture

315
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:09,220
phases i mean you know what whatever you
call it jay-z RJ 100 whatever whatever

316
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:15,809
it is ok where I'm at we use of the
college a blow it works but what am i

317
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:19,210
doing I'm going to essentially go back
into here and I'm gonna reset those

318
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:25,040
expectations right during the
architectural solution I'm going to

319
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,470
essentially say here's my expectations
at the end here's what I want to see

320
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,820
this is usually where most people like
me as an architect or anybody who's in

321
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,990
that paper promo

322
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:42,520
often and again assistance during
high-level low level design I want to

323
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,920
make sure that you know they're going to
do certain things maybe I want them to

324
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:51,030
encrypt traffic I might want them also
to run weekly assessments in compliance

325
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:58,309
with socks during OJ QJ 3284 with a
final assessment J pi just depends on

326
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:02,910
how I'm gonna attack that problem I'll
go through it also my static code

327
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,559
testing to happen

328
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,250
money might step static static security
scale have happened there

329
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:15,600
dynamic testing happen estates poor web
or abilities mobile war abilities all

330
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:22,178
hit that like five in the manual test
six so when you see this I should be

331
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:27,679
involved in all these phases application
security should be every step of it from

332
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,070
a practical standpoint and and again

333
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:38,949
for a practical standpoint and recently
what I propose that a company that I'm

334
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:45,179
at is to start out where to application
security testing take people and to have

335
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:49,850
one project liaison person and I like
why do I need his third person because I

336
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,820
don't want to tie up the time of the
application security people to sit in on

337
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,809
these meetings that liaison person
should hopefully be able to translate

338
00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:01,320
things and act as a go-between they
don't have to be overly technical fairly

339
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,639
cheap but they need to be a little bit
more managerial why because the time of

340
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,070
these absences at testers I don't want
them to spend time in meetings I want

341
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:16,960
them to be testing out ok and the total
number I threw out there is every time

342
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,720
we get to the point where they're gonna
do in 20 hours a week roughly one out

343
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,850
now granted it too small to big depends
on the size of the app but over an

344
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:31,649
average I found that typically a single
person who isn't getting tied up in

345
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:36,890
meetings can do about a hundred absent
here has made two weeks of vacation 50

346
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,510
weeks a year I'm gonna get through
roughly almost 200 apps so if I wanted

347
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:48,230
to 200 apps will yet again what do you
think about it when I did you know the

348
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,690
static testing a lot of that should
already have been done ahead of time by

349
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:56,110
my developers developers and at the
moment and just make sure my developers

350
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:02,540
aren't cheating me and then it is this
really weird step 6 is that's where I'm

351
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,040
bringing in my people to do that twenty
hours of testing they would get all the

352
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,889
resolves it would make sure that the
last text and everything was clean if

353
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,580
not if there's something critical they
threw back hopefully by then naturally

354
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:24,330
without liaison with do then finally
moving on the big thing I always tell

355
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:29,030
developers they nice to have a guy I
don't see them here is named Mr Osborne

356
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:33,649
always leave it at that he said come
over to be like certain you do need and

357
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:40,270
pardon my app is kind of funny because
he literally was like I wanna get your

358
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,389
by offsetting that way later on I don't
have to get yelled at for better

359
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:47,939
whatever they should get to that point
you know usually people are counting on

360
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:53,609
you you're delivering some better apps
at least that's how I viewed it as when

361
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:56,489
you to the point where you're completely
bored out of your mind that you probably

362
00:27:56,489 --> 00:28:00,969
achieve your goal now we say trust but
verify

363
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:05,918
oh quick question as they may know which
president kind of coin that phrase

364
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,549
breaking yeah trust but verify

365
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:16,519
so what's it's off and running where
will the risk to well here's the thing

366
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:22,289
risk is like a diamond you chasing this
risk is getting new you might start with

367
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:25,829
the external apt to the risk moves the
internal apps then from the internal

368
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,649
apps become the vendor apps you're
chasing this demon around you're going

369
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:35,918
to constantly go looking for risk ok you
gonna start to ask yourself what's an

370
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,359
opportunity to assess well maybe the IP
phone system might be my next

371
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,339
opportunity really have some fun into
show of management just how good we are

372
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:49,479
you can take application security as far
as want to take it the reality is that

373
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:52,359
almost everything has a web server on it
right

374
00:28:52,359 --> 00:29:01,039
sure about that that would illusion
right you know it's been a Tesla tell me

375
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:07,759
it's not running about sir so required
you're better perform verification the

376
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,329
biggest thing you'll find is your
vendors will be lying to you a lot of

377
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:15,969
not always a number of can't tell you
how many how many security vendors have

378
00:29:15,969 --> 00:29:22,369
been popular last year they might now
too many that's the correct answer to

379
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:27,908
many security vendors popular last year
so again start putting some pressure on

380
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:31,509
your vendors and and really where I
tried this towards this as I find the

381
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:35,940
vulnerability as I find these weaknesses
in the vendor at that's when I go back

382
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,719
and I tell her church during
renegotiations hey guess what we're

383
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:43,229
paying for crappy application we're
buying some you know some products

384
00:29:43,229 --> 00:29:47,529
inferior we should be getting some
serious discounts and either put the

385
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:51,719
burden back on the vendor to give you
you know that superior product that you

386
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:55,450
need or you put the burden back on the
vendor to cut the

387
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:00,090
cut the price down to a level that
you're OK to live with and I had a

388
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:04,039
better before going well you know what's
gonna mattered you guys weather how much

389
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:09,750
you pay I told him really quite simply
my view on that is now I need to spend

390
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:15,340
more on operational security to cover
your weaknesses so you're helping the

391
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:21,740
paper that next-generation firewall or
whatever you know cloud web service to

392
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:28,250
essentially propel the taxes are gonna
try to exploit your written code so

393
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:35,360
again you can you can drive to stop down
to as far as you want to take it you

394
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:43,949
know a good application security program
typically they're not bored here again

395
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,590
your your vendor is gonna look at a few
seconds and expense so they had to do

396
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,939
the exact same thing they got to get to
the level d sometimes their level B is

397
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,950
more like your level like they don't
want to spend hardly any money because

398
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:04,130
they're looking to you know paper that
new yah so considerations i do want to

399
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:09,149
call out something 'cause i've i've seen
this before people sometimes long

400
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:13,840
application security and to you a
department that's a bad idea in my

401
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,860
opinion could you do it

402
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:21,379
yeah you could do it however QA is going
for different set of goals compared

403
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,429
application security there is some
crossover and maybe techniques in style

404
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:30,570
and and and and how you achieve your
goals however Michaels and Q eight goals

405
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:36,230
are completely separate okay and you
might needed L CIO is that cuz they get

406
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,889
a lot of CIOs lot of cis owes don't know
that they're like oh I just know it and

407
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:46,418
QA and hates all the same stuff to cuba
is just trying to basically find out how

408
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:50,490
far can I take it for the outbreaks I'm
trying to see how quickly I can steal

409
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:55,330
data walk away with it so I don't care
if it breaks in fact I don't want to

410
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,549
break I want to steal all your data and
essentially become a rich man living on

411
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:02,549
a beach that's all they're looking for

412
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:09,279
over time what can I do if I don't have
a QA program maybe stand up and help

413
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,909
them create a separate program also may
be time to create an internal red team

414
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:19,730
that purple team of sorts I guess how
you want to phrase it anymore maybe some

415
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,600
setup that internal red team I'd want to
go through and say hey you know maybe

416
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,719
this is where ever we do an official pen
testing GV and you know we're gonna take

417
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,029
you know we're in you know production
and we're gonna take it to the next

418
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:35,789
level and exploit people along with
technology

419
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:41,990
alright so I do want to have a shameless
plug and we're gonna start answering

420
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:47,250
questions I think we're on time I hope
we were right on time

421
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:52,320
comment besides if you don't know about
it it's another security conference you

422
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,279
have in January we just got kicked out
of her last menu so congratulations to

423
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:59,620
us it happened

424
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,340
perception of people doing bad things
right

425
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,129
were intensely gonna try to avoid this
week on week end this next round if you

426
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:14,269
know it's me connie is great we usually
have three tracks of security goodness

427
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:20,179
and we have nice badges its though to
prove we have fun we have a good time

428
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:22,019
it's like 20 bucks

429
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:27,870
25 but again if you are to have a chance
to be side they're great they're great

430
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:32,979
offense I think the next closest one is
Cincinnati's in May and cleveland is in

431
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,710
June so glad to be side website and
check it out I'll be talking to

432
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,259
Baltimore about security automation I'm
not going to talk about what that

433
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:44,450
gentleman reform he talked about is that
was unique

434
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:50,520
that's all but

435
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,879
I gotta work on some slides later this
summer who knows I don't know where

436
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:01,380
it'll take me to the scary automation
stock price you can link it with me on

437
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,530
Twitter I will warn you on Twitter I'm
seeing I'm not a nice person I say off

438
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:13,310
the cuff remarks you probably shouldn't
say in my career but you have questions

439
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,399
feel free to ask me afterwards hit me up
on LinkedIn

440
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,080
just one thing I do when I advise people
on the questions become consulting

441
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,239
consulting thing that's a whole nother
animal and i have been duped into the

442
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:31,500
into the thing before we're essentially
I've been brought in for an interview so

443
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,889
that people could understand how to do
application security and that was a bit

444
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:38,668
frustrating so later on when it came
time for them trying to really find the

445
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:42,839
application security people after they
miserably fail I told the recruiter oh

446
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,720
by the way so just understand that

447
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,719
consulting the whole nother able to
questions

448
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:14,730
well hopefully you have an approval step
so if you go back to this SDLC hopefully

449
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:20,110
if if if I have stood it up correctly he
serious like number six implementation

450
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:24,040
number five rating there hopefully at
that point that's prime basically given

451
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,790
the green light to move forward if I
don't have that green light opportunity

452
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:31,400
some people call that like an
architecture reviews who you're however

453
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,970
you don't want to find it but hopefully
I have the ability to beat so at this

454
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:40,169
point if you have that ability veto
that's really where you want it because

455
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,390
i've seen this before 2 I've seen a lot
of people you go through this whole

456
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:47,529
process they get the Jays 0 J one they
get their approval and then guess what

457
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:53,690
they do they go off and they spend your
money and they do something major people

458
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:59,220
do it all the time live because nobody's
looking and then later on

459
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:04,029
find out when they're in implementation
oh yeah well you know we went back to

460
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:12,680
what we wanted to anyways sorry we spent
all the money to jail at that basically

461
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,200
between protest and implementation power
to drop it in

462
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:33,430
that's a good question it depends on the
situation of where I'm going with this

463
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:40,058
documentary so when it comes to my
vendors these days I wanted external

464
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:46,579
scanner color Barracuda check marks I
run into their which one works better I

465
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,599
am in general

466
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,510
fairly neutral because I think that most
cases people failed technology is used

467
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,950
technology they are gonna do about the
same thing there might be some better

468
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,359
bells and whistles versus another

469
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:05,720
used to be built fortify product did
really well with the Java side of the

470
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,200
house to a certain degree and then what
was previously out of lab now the IBM

471
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,819
security product it did a slightly
better dot dot net those could have

472
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:20,200
changed and they probably have to be
honest with you if I could

473
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,140
rose anything in an environment
especially when it comes to things like

474
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,140
this to me application security is kind
of a niche thing I thought we doing

475
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,230
firewalls

476
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,539
management I would probably try to have
as many different products and diversity

477
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:46,309
as possible ok so you know how I did
that was that my with my lead program

478
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:50,130
their bonuses were tied back to how good
they were doing their application

479
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:55,490
security scans so so again I go back to
my program here where I'm like you know

480
00:37:55,490 --> 00:38:02,939
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna have my
lead actors that big brother of sorts to

481
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,430
make sure that people are doing it right
I'm gonna have that lead his bonus is

482
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:14,649
gonna be tied to 20% how low they can
meet the metrics now is it possible to

483
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,789
lead could keep me yes so what do I need
to do I need to go in and delete stuff

484
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:25,089
every now and then I need to make sure
that I read that why I don't come in to

485
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:25,609
do it

486
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:35,359
come in and check out this Friday just
FYI and all the sudden you might say but

487
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,210
but again

488
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,730
it's funny because people like you know
how do I get people takes its security

489
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:45,220
seriously it's simple pipe back the
money back to Boehner's hey securities

490
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:52,649
15% your problems 15% bonus or 15% your
pay is this you can't do it yes that is

491
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:56,810
a lot of cairo's won't do it but if
you're in a place where it's really

492
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:02,980
critical they will convince me otherwise
but yeah when it comes to

493
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,320
products I would say diversify as much
as possible I mean I hate to say it but

494
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,780
when it comes right down to it

495
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,100
most people can do almost all this stuff
with free tools out on the way you can

496
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,240
use burp you can use a lot of different
things it's all free

497
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,689
haley's near 300 bucks or whatever it
was pretty pretty well in my opinion so

498
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:47,650
was it just that question are dynamic
voter yeah yeah I know what I did as I

499
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,150
drove it towards like this lead program
so the Leeds essentially started

500
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:56,609
educating the developers on how to do
better coding and and unlike again I'm

501
00:39:56,609 --> 00:40:01,299
not trying to be harsh on the previous
speaker but you know when it came to

502
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:06,030
train the developers it really wasn't
that bad and developers just need to

503
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:10,160
know what to look for and you know what
to do and most developers I generally

504
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,649
find ninety percent of the people are
fairly common accommodating and they're

505
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,670
fairly good people you know it's at five
to ten percent that are gonna do things

506
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,220
were you know they're in a binder they
don't really care I don't think anybody

507
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:25,529
says I don't want to do security i mean
necessarily mean ABC like i dont wanna

508
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,140
do it right now

509
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,420
developers well enough to know that
they're trying to get things done and I

510
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:37,390
completely appreciate that but in
general what I found is that if I create

511
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:42,080
an environment where I kinda have an
opportunity for people to appear check

512
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,369
generally speaking they don't want to be
that person he's now waiting somebody

513
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:53,530
else's so costly run people to parents
and in a time when you say the word

514
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,600
price and constantly it's more like just
run them through you know the number

515
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,180
that makes you make your company feel
comfortable

516
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,350
checks it's not going to be perfect
you're gonna always have somebody could

517
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,350
use this system

518
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,079
any last questions

519
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,530
yeah actually

520
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:22,190
I put him out on on through like slight
sure they'll be online so if anybody

521
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:28,410
actually want to see like how we used to
do it at Chase way back when we actually

522
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,740
have like three hundred and some slides
or you go through the whole thing is

523
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,470
actually what we use it sounds like
you're right now I don't think che

524
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:39,450
scares has been like 12 years right but
its own on-site chair right now it's

525
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,419
what we used to use a trade that the
developers on to say hey here's what

526
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,810
we're looking at here is how we're
looking at the tackle these problems can

527
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:50,880
I used it is like a lunch and learn so
essentially over the period of about

528
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,850
four weeks over white two hours a week
you know we paid for lunch and was

529
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:01,420
probably the best one thousand dollar
spent was buying lunch they went through

530
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,100
and they actually started listening to
us and then guess what eventually over

531
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:09,799
time we became the Maytag repairman
we're bored because there was nothing

532
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,860
like the fix the vendors hated us that
was fun

533
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:21,689
beyond SlideShare there's a good one out
there

534
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:27,030
chase on the outset obscurity to realize
that it's out there is completely it's

535
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,880
still very pertinent even those five
years ago because the techniques really

536
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,480
haven't changed dramatically the web
technology has but to a certain degree

537
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,830
but it just got a little more integrated
that's one thing I would say that my

538
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,799
girl looking for tools and have what I
would do when it came to buying it at

539
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,260
all said I would look for the world to
me would be the word integration how can

540
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:52,650
I get to integrate in with you know
certain things like Jenkins how can I

541
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:56,390
get to integrate in with certain
technologies that I'm using eternally if

542
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:00,950
I'm a big guy p.m. shop maybe they've
got it ty back into the you know the QAA

543
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:04,230
cycle and the sum of the various IBM

544
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,370
developments will said that they have
anymore which are constantly changing

545
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:12,350
names like but if that's the case I
would look for that in my products with

546
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:17,080
the developers for static testing to me
that writing more important a lot of you

547
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,529
like to go well you know I've got this
product over here who found no five

548
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:25,160
percent more vulnerabilities in this
product that's great but no one is using

549
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,740
it what's the point I still have the one

550
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,879
as 5 percent fewer vulnerabilities but
has perfect integration and my

551
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,420
developers when using it because it
makes life a little bit better in the

552
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:46,050
long run said to be in a word is always
an iteration put in the CIA but run your

553
00:43:46,050 --> 00:44:43,010
developers like you doing a lot you try
to upload something to them and trust

554
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:49,830
you defined it yes I guess you're doing
a perfect trust but verify make sure

555
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:55,750
that no one's cheetan system is people
cheat that's kind of human nature he

556
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:06,609
thinks that they won't use taxes right
now there are ya

557
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:49,420
bring in you bring on somebody who's
been doing business security walking

558
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:54,790
from one phone call me and say this
person and I said things change

559
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:30,740
yeah yeah yeah

560
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,500
how I ended up and when I was eight
cases however in the pen security where

561
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:42,400
they had a little bit size keyword
little and a little bit of experience

562
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,730
and see what I was doing at a previous
role like two or three previous role

563
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:54,090
before that and that's kind of how I got
an application security and in that sort

564
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,050
of thing too as I found that you know
finding a really good developer the pair

565
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:00,870
up with was really valuable than I've
gotten really good it just drawing code

566
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:03,339
and being the bad guy

567
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,710
indeed the creator of great things
reason why I have a lot of respect for

568
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:10,040
what people can make security code and
the people that you know I'm basically

569
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,770
like hey let me buy you lunch today

570
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:20,610
you know he had a question sir well

571
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:52,190
just that one side only on training I
guess in a way I would probably do I

572
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:57,270
guess it depends on how to meet its
value of how much money was spent to do

573
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:58,110
it

574
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:01,610
versus how much time at the time
requirements are little I probably you

575
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:05,250
know again a scary person had one asset
want to do it you know for the actual

576
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:14,950
you know that you're kind of in right
now leading up to it if i dont have if i

577
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:18,750
dont have the finances of the time to do
it then probably what I do is I just

578
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:23,310
make almost kinda like back here I'd
almost make each one of these

579
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:28,440
checkpoints when I get that really you
know to certain stages like 23456 I make

580
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,600
this is as points of my spirit
definitely at the end obviously I want

581
00:48:32,600 --> 00:49:13,310
to do in your chest verify the address
controversial ooh yeah absolutely

582
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:19,430
component of it if I have my lead in
there in the middle of during the week

583
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:23,040
that person's kinda or less running with
it for a return that spread and they're

584
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,230
gonna take the lead on essentially drive
it home near the biggest thing is that

585
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:32,150
it's just really is back that from a
financial standpoint you know do I wanna

586
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:37,880
burn $100 on this project will maybe
it's worth 200 house you know maybe this

587
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:43,809
this project and again maybe you only do
five products a year but in some

588
00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:48,690
companies they do five hundred-year you
just have to build it to scale the wall

589
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:51,950
level that you're ok with you know maybe
you only have one application security

590
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:59,049
person where I was jus jobs ago that's
basically what i was i was i was the

591
00:49:59,049 --> 00:50:03,210
application security person and it
really was only during their development

592
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:08,790
cycles are only happened over the summer
months because of their cycle they

593
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:15,009
wouldn't do a whole lot of changes or or
much of anything over the winter so

594
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:22,160
essentially they were driving you know I
kinda was in modern bode 12 in 30 over

595
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:28,848
the summer or winter and then when I
take over things is 45 and 60 over the

596
00:50:28,849 --> 00:50:33,869
summer when they're looking to deploy
code make lots of changes but again it

597
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:37,150
depends on where you're at and what
you're going to do and and during that

598
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:43,299
time period I could hit like 80 to 85
absentee year which means typically over

599
00:50:43,299 --> 00:50:48,150
a six-month period only did before you
come out just how many they released if

600
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:55,240
I'm only gonna do five and again I'm a
huge company and all of his five a drop

601
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,589
in five hundred dollars on something may
not be a big deal it just depends

602
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:03,740
and again that's where I was kind of a
meeting with all this is you got it you

603
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,828
gotta drive message was that point of
how much money they want to spend to get

604
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:12,599
to a certain level of security lots of
people think I've got it I got a barium

605
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:18,869
in all this fancy technology in the
Mandarin doesn't care and happy time I

606
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:33,960
can't tell you how much technology I
find sitting on a show you know yet

607
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:41,520
time had about 300 people and we had
about around a hundred 220 developer to

608
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,680
build a lot of their own custom code
reason why they were you know that's why

609
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:53,299
they were essentially you know you know
what they're doing our own security

610
00:51:53,300 --> 00:52:00,300
testing because nobody also gonna do for
us and they are they're quite how was it

611
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:08,540
was it was it was credible they didn't
need it went up something quite tell ya

612
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:12,060
trying to pick unless I just
misstatement about training I just

613
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:16,480
didn't like I think I think that saying
I'm never gonna try my developer is kind

614
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:22,930
of a waste you can train developers he
said by March it's not easy like anyone

615
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:25,930
else technology by a month you're going
to narrow the time

616
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:30,470
shake their head up and down right now I
learned in India this means my here

617
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:37,730
they're working thank you appreciate it
if you have any questions
