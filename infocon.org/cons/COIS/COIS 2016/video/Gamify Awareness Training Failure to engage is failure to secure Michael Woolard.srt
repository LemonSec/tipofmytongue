1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,950
again but my name is Michael where I
work for technology organization if I

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:12,240
didn't work on their security team there
do things like policies risk assessment

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,110
of our web applications we bill Belton
with all our different teams and then

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:26,439
most important in our organization here
is a larger talk to you in a couple

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,460
times the part that we should be
focusing on here with this talk more

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:38,569
about the concept of why this works
better than straight lectures

7
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:52,889
paperwork sign up you know if you see
this again it might be a different

8
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:58,579
talking what he sees as they really want
to start out with you know how will I

9
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:07,120
get into the tools and you know what he
used by training the slight not trying

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:21,740
to steal anybody's under interim self
I'm sorry but no money of information

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:33,369
out there about bill garden after my
experience that's why this is important

12
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:42,310
that all year ago

13
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,320
developers care and feeding in the top
he got into the reality

14
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:58,740
what developers here and see and what's
the latest security professionals resent

15
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,839
the information and how they accept it
goes well beyond just developers and the

16
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,600
whole web application development cycle
because I had to our marvin's he's our

17
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,810
customers are different teams throughout
the organization and ways of improving

18
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,480
our communication and that's just simply
telling them you know how but actually

19
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:30,190
showing them know why organizations
about 35 employees have branches down in

20
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,700
Columbus and I'm going to be talking
about participation in the event that we

21
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:41,260
did we talk about dollars so you don't
just throw back to your organization

22
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:54,010
united we stand with no shoes no secret
that you know security is not the core

23
00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:01,130
priority when building which is the case
may be no shortcuts in the place we'll

24
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:06,600
come back to solve problems later in her
first step they finally

25
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,100
$2.09 advised to make security part of
it as much as I can cripple presentation

26
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:19,380
just what they want to find out of here
is that none of this really says that we

27
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:28,239
don't hear January and June Medical
tower to be today's hearings today

28
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:42,459
security code you know so you know we
don't care I do think the problem is

29
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,720
more than just you know more or less
than

30
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:55,410
and the scene because in 2016 daily
round the clock multiple breaches

31
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:02,910
all-time can serve a 20 percent of
people came back seat 10 security

32
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,390
application development there is no
security 25% CA comes in after the

33
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,869
inflated production 30 percent say that
security is fundamental

34
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:20,410
is at the discretion of the developments
in 2007 team at any given point reading

35
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:29,700
between the lines of all this saying
that 75% there's no security and

36
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:36,810
development process I guess it is not a
problem reaching the securities markets

37
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,390
a problem

38
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:48,280
jungle tree has been brought into humans
are the biggest legal any organization

39
00:04:48,280 --> 00:05:03,159
we don't hatch figure we make mistakes
and tongue in cheek me care training has

40
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,050
to be the essential point of it all

41
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,490
peace train people ISO standards
required audit standards required

42
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,890
compliance is the only player in
checking the box that you do it because

43
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,340
you know you head out policies once you
you meet with your new employees for a

44
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:28,469
half hour we're not cutting and I don't
know where his thought-provoking being

45
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:35,520
cagey you know you have to teach people
to think critically you through what

46
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,870
they need to do have to be here why you
know we have to protect us which is that

47
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:51,950
and we can actually we detail our
security awareness happier here that's a

48
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:58,800
lot of us think you know maybe a nervous
wreck taper into it and yes we know how

49
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,720
it feels to be reached how different you
know

50
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,030
genetic stuff go down and internalize it
and try to make our stuff like that but

51
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:15,500
when it comes to you know what a hectare
is no simply just thinking critically

52
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:25,210
room in front of logic with holistically
about what it is what's the challenge

53
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:30,239
what's what's this in front of you and
how do I get around in terms of web

54
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,580
application has numerous simply applying
logic to Arco to our algorithms nor does

55
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:44,530
not only knew everything is just do what
was possible for no other reason just to

56
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:50,400
see what happens he wanted to let you
know how they want to know why why is

57
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,429
very important for them because the
difference between security knowledge

58
00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:05,150
you know we are now from years and years
just as down memorization of facts

59
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,090
something that somebody learn days
months League centuries ago just being

60
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:16,250
has down to us until we actually
understand why something how something

61
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:22,670
works for somebody else and second video
here

62
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:44,639
chapter so we don't teach the
intelligence to find something great

63
00:07:44,639 --> 00:08:02,970
children's his savings savings and now
the same thing to do then we're all

64
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:24,669
saying we're told you because you're
never really solutions based on people

65
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:28,159
that got into it because I like to think
outside parts you like to see some

66
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:37,569
problems with work not something we got
involved with the problem is you know

67
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:47,190
each other around and we try to train
based on the way as the group is she

68
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:53,850
going with her trade for do some reason
for bed but in the end you know Nate's

69
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:01,790
just had it in the news a few weeks ago
about somebody was able to hack Facebook

70
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:11,469
account wasn't fully but it's something
that we went back and looked at me

71
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,850
should that are being sites in our QA
sites know stuff that were made public

72
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,870
the time that news stories about
different things that are going on we

73
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,420
always learn from so whether it was
their intentions to protect it

74
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:31,069
their intention to buy passes for always
learning rose understanding now my job

75
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:40,610
is to let the case you were on full of
production through the whole steps of

76
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:46,380
trying to make sure no I'm not exactly
just throwing things at the mall you

77
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,710
know just trying whatever

78
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,840
myself in the patient's talk to each
other how our web applications talking

79
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,610
back in his deputies were however they
understand the whole process from

80
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,800
beginning to end of how about the pH
work so that I can finally problems with

81
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:14,939
nine of the other eight goes back to our
place or I was going to try to use those

82
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:22,880
to bypass in but in the end will always
make things better

83
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:30,660
we had previous leaders and tough talk
about how little it's also have a lovely

84
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,140
day trip the first period of Muslims

85
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:40,210
science

86
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,710
point of all this is not that I want you
to be able to go back to your teeth and

87
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,810
say hey we're going to solve you know
just rented space

88
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:57,939
know if you have an engaging security
training thinking critically through

89
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,220
security crops about you make it part of
your culture hopefully to that effect

90
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,500
real change

91
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,990
work for any of those people that are
listed here we might not all be here in

92
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:14,210
this room today maybe work needs to be
still may be doing all these things all

93
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:21,040
these people to actually think outside
the box to get our car companies where

94
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:32,170
they are today after gallery bills
training every chapter two decades you

95
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:44,620
having to be aging and only done through
lecture is done through videos where the

96
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:50,680
case may be the only focus on policies
procedures and we keep it very narrow

97
00:11:50,680 --> 00:12:00,859
and very focused because wrong thing to
remember is that our employees have a

98
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:12,010
job of the roomed goal is to make sure
they have a fire he's worthy to be

99
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:18,230
inside their job inside the rules and
security not indeed not

100
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:26,530
thought-provoking just what city do
their job creating a culture of box

101
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:34,150
checkers know what is the bare minimum I
need to do to get the job done and how

102
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:41,240
we need to have excuses

103
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:49,250
much as I want to I don't agree with
their town of the also fall back I'm not

104
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:56,220
very easy to blame for our problems but
the reality is that city you know he

105
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,770
summits they're not sitting in the
various conferences that go on around

106
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:11,270
the country they're not watching it is
or not involved in various Twitter 21st

107
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:17,500
around the club there's simply looking
at security is what I have to do not get

108
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,260
fire when you have a culture like that
who's afraid of holding up a project of

109
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:30,610
not enough checkboxes somebody who sees
a problem underlying tone of the

110
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,290
companies that will just take care that
they are not going to hold up this

111
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:41,290
project because the parties to go fast
as you feel like this you know checklist

112
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,469
said that they have burned bars at him a
lot

113
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:50,650
gained 1.1 1.0 was pushed out the door
after a week reached because I'm to

114
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:58,050
reach their pantry so you know we had to
check with their health screening but at

115
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:04,839
the same time don't realize that you can
jump over the top

116
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:11,430
stuff out the door or gate code 404 not
engaged in actually protecting the

117
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,729
engagement falling under Charteris what
I'm trying to say is that we we get our

118
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,870
culture to stay home this degree will
get this case from a security

119
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,480
perspective let's make a decision

120
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:35,220
company that we need to protect it up to
the standard we're not just freaks who

121
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,030
do you think a hold of a project of you
know actually implementing security

122
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,899
policies were actually trying to effect
real change within our company

123
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:49,949
and I'm thinking that checklist letters
don't work I'm just saying that you need

124
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:59,910
to have a bigger part of your culture of
you want little piece of the whole three

125
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:14,480
my problem came to a head last october
31 tools and procedures was carried out

126
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:23,079
in that application time is building a
program around demonstrating against it

127
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:29,368
nine years at all I thought this is
great do this change will go to this

128
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:35,360
developers of recent you able to this
meeting and we'll come back to the

129
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,449
strain on his emails outside hey who
doesn't end with you I got all these

130
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:51,149
responses that doesn't do it do it on
September they will probably go ahead

131
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:58,300
and other things that happened at the
party today two parties yet sounds good

132
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,550
but you know something else comes up and
go ahead and do something else so I had

133
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,929
to switch gears I had to think
differently I wanna trying to be mean I

134
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:13,660
couldn't just simply rely on these
different lectures and everything that

135
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:21,249
I've always done that points because you
know the lectures were fun obviously and

136
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:24,819
I talked about bringing people to this
lecture at the last meeting obviously

137
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:35,339
something else came up the change we can
make it mandatory that works in trendy I

138
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:41,759
want to build a more engaging way I want
to be able to say no this isn't just a

139
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:49,709
simple sit here and let's actually do
something that's more fun more practice

140
00:16:49,709 --> 00:17:00,349
with what we're doing a week later we
fucked over a lot over what we call taxi

141
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:06,579
on October 28th tremendous to our events
in the capture the flag for we had some

142
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:15,319
laughs while that was going on during
the suspension or cafe also did some

143
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:26,388
discussion on social engineering courses
your screensaver like we did some wifi

144
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:34,709
password examples appliances you know
what to say that but it all started with

145
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:42,279
this post back from that I want to
market segments and handy logo will be

146
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:49,889
doing this training later this afternoon
as a simply post the picture in there

147
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:59,080
are there is this headache I knew I was
on something because as soon as I posted

148
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,658
that within 10 minutes of those people
you know I just stopped me in the hall

149
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:08,809
people email me I had a conversation
started

150
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:15,370
why what was going on but as always I
thought people thought I had people know

151
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:22,570
somewhat excited about the new something
different going on out there you know I

152
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:27,730
talked to him about two weeks later just
before I posted this I got stopped by

153
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:34,440
American TCA we got a fun business I
just did you get people you know and all

154
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,770
that

155
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:44,340
no money no they're trying to play along
with all sorts of people didn't know

156
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:50,000
this poster talking about the actual
number of the flag from the time I had

157
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,490
no idea how did you ever I was gonna do
it the way as they try to figure it out

158
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,910
because you know I just knew what I was
doing at the time was there instead of

159
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,280
concentrating the message on you know
we're going to be doing this changing at

160
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,180
all by the way it is I capture the flag
to post everything about you know prizes

161
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:15,030
the events that capture the flag you
know tournament itself and by the way if

162
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,300
you want to participate in this is
needed is down the street to teach you

163
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,830
how hackers break into web applications

164
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:29,610
tell us a little bit obviously by
training on how this time work how

165
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:35,310
effective get i dont wanna make it sound
fun and 18 it simple I want to see

166
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:40,399
people to be interested and when I
posted the signup sheet for this I got

167
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:47,770
so I was expecting people to sign up
from the original training I seventy

168
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:55,920
people signed up for day or for weak
Chinese the first 10 people actually

169
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:04,390
came from the non technical side of town
staff from our customers here I was not

170
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:11,310
expecting to be interested in this site
about signing up for that short term

171
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:17,340
ends I got a 35 40 people signed up for
that and 6:10 reforma not technical site

172
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:22,520
so I kind of get more people I knew I
had the attention of the company I had

173
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,760
something I wanted to build I do wanna
lose that what I did I actually made to

174
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:35,620
difference we had our technical team and
then we had our side of the terms those

175
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,540
who people

176
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:44,080
self-restraint for so many people never
even saw Cody for that type stuff so we

177
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:51,830
this is the actual tournament self
pollinated this events we did the

178
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:58,850
kickoff of that had the contest going to
class for all these things about the

179
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:05,290
show you how they were to go back to my
website that I had its beginning of the

180
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:09,270
end of WordPress site I get a lot more
detailed how these things work and all

181
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:16,230
that type of stuff he was beating so
what we're going through all these

182
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:23,420
various train the event going on you
know I had these for identical to each

183
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:30,050
other and said you know 2012 ahead I'll
text file on said this is likely drive

184
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:34,210
to him had a text file on his graduation
you infected the phone number

185
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,360
the whole point of this is a simply to
teach people about the dangers of you

186
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,439
know I get a USB Drive he never seen
before

187
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,440
prices for small business and our
Starbucks gift card

188
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:59,040
one-at-a-time people trying to try to
capture the flag other modules that was

189
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,040
played up here

190
00:22:19,030 --> 00:23:29,590
so to answer just the configuration is
because of that conversation of what

191
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,939
that is and then the enemy play this
game of trying to get us well as it is

192
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:43,280
for this example if you want to hear
what you're seeing with security

193
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:50,970
shutters which is free from sexual his
mom will just give you a brief rundown

194
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:57,650
of what's the model holdouts
deterioration is an elevation is so if

195
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:08,550
you're just actually doing any type of
outpatient these are these are the stop

196
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,649
but we had a just another game I get a
little $10

197
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:20,980
hard then finally did nothing to do it
raining right thing I noticed more fun

198
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:27,820
we were trying to defeat buzzer code
were trying to do something silly and so

199
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:32,800
we just didn't get a box of crickets and
about in this box if it doesn't give you

200
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:42,649
$10 get part two people that are talking
about mass murderers and there's just

201
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:50,930
something silly major foreign to me that
we played throughout the month of

202
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:57,270
October and culminated at the event
itself so we put posters up around the

203
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:03,610
building last month talking about lock
your computers and all that but we did

204
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:08,500
you find this PC review so if you call
another employee didn't appear box you

205
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,360
get two points from a loss of points
manager 3.4 percent for whites

206
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,939
executives it is like this is Andrew
blinds and those kind of creepy I took

207
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:30,040
together because we got good numbers
there a lot of people were playing at

208
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,610
the start of it they want had 57
submissions 45 after two weeks I was

209
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:44,320
down to three or four submissions in a
private area and that the numbers up

210
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,970
here at the end a little bit more but I
also found out as people start playing

211
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:56,230
and teaching and so that's why we're
playing this game again I was done after

212
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:03,770
to meet you know i i kind of results I
wanted to start thinking about it start

213
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:08,220
locking their computer is there having
fun with this screen savers is no point

214
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:14,320
three you got this email from one of our
agents saying that long story short that

215
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,210
basically she's somebody not by there
are three

216
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:24,370
also go right back to where does when he
came back yesterday what's going on and

217
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:29,419
they said that they forgot to lock the
computer and taken to the extreme he

218
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:37,260
said yeah I thought that was really just
everything that I was trying to do here

219
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,850
that you know people love to do these
type of things whether your business

220
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:50,350
competition runs so much stuff in our
life you've got competition competition

221
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:57,240
history for his work is because always
that competition they're good versus

222
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:04,290
evil wherever KCD that really drives a
lot of what we do next major thing to do

223
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:10,720
is a sports cards we purchased a whole
bunch of these training makes sense just

224
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,620
return it within our cafe their
head-to-head tournament's first person

225
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,669
to get the lock was on to next round

226
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:28,100
second place to live in harmony and your
second place as you see the stuff that's

227
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:37,370
no extensive overall you raised close to
$600 for this whole dense three hundred

228
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:46,639
dollars was spent on prices and prices
than $290 major the main event was

229
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:54,330
emceed up again we just had to scream
once the weather so everybody can watch

230
00:27:54,330 --> 00:28:02,620
what was going on at the cafe from my
site goes back to the people who were

231
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,620
excellent Capsiplex

232
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:15,680
else we have all sorts of fun with
people showing up at City headed out

233
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:24,350
package included their potential to get
lost in the wounded another little

234
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:31,949
giveaway that we had we had made up
stickers made up here and everybody

235
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:39,820
participate in the tray devotees will
probably head bands to try and make him

236
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:45,060
honorary just didn't participate from
their desks

237
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:52,070
ventilate what is the largest doing
things that we did just really stuck in

238
00:28:52,070 --> 00:29:01,780
really got people interested in having
fun with this is these prices I think

239
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:09,639
the price of possible offenders as the
shadow bar there and make sure I make it

240
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:15,370
more official make it personal but it is
thought that refines something that

241
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:32,159
sunday post does not just the tools and
stuff that we use the question from

242
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:39,030
earlier application security project is
tools all these different teaching

243
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:46,990
standards documentation list goes on and
on about it is anybody could fall down a

244
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:52,430
time as you would be to a project now
projects that come out of Austin

245
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:58,820
rises so do with very little children
second

246
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:05,820
30331 there is basically

247
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:15,139
with birds like proxy type tools at the
attacks and that allows you to

248
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:19,178
manipulate information now keep in mind
I get a lot of people who are not

249
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:30,240
familiar with Asians how they work and
so do the train that is a very good tool

250
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,549
used because everything too so just
elementary with it

251
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:42,899
everything that has to do with you are
here I was down here what's your

252
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:47,979
technology history which is due at the
break points and all that everything is

253
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,860
done peacefully in so doing the train
from my perspective is so much easier

254
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,899
than using any of those other tools
because it just simply say no more

255
00:30:56,899 --> 00:31:11,000
patient and jumping from 1010 jumping
around the actual application itself as

256
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I have all sorts of ability to
manipulate this configuration however I

257
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,500
want I could say as a CD I consider this
great training this year

258
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:29,620
natural uses more of a training tool
there's cheat sheets in here there's all

259
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,719
sorts of stuff here that well now you to
do the training do you know everything

260
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:42,850
in an interactive way to explain what
security configuration is that about his

261
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,850
kids into what we need to do to solve
this

262
00:31:53,690 --> 00:33:15,370
and myself and for them it's not a
simple senior that's learned about the

263
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:19,139
stuff in iraq has seen action they could
point that you're rewarded for what they

264
00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:29,340
do at the end you get prices all that
type of stuff is also available that day

265
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:39,110
so they can keep their laptops home
broken leg application yes actually

266
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:42,110
provided by ITC

267
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:50,790
basically away and always been partial
to turn everything that we did for this

268
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:59,690
capture the flag they got into this talk
about the money but once mighty my

269
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:05,120
markings and easy money from trade voted
once you figure out where to come over

270
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:12,679
various vendors in the area and said hey
and restraint he do it she said it get

271
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:17,730
involved in money from security and
entries about $600 which is very

272
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:23,530
possible for our next year which we
budgeted are ready to be something a lot

273
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,960
of these organizations that out I heard
through this I saw them over doing so

274
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:34,130
however doing it for people to get
involved and time money people to do in

275
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:40,460
training for us money to get better
prices all that type of stuff so it's

276
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,690
going to be even bigger this year and
the only five percent of people said

277
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:54,120
they stay the entire time he's going too
far away from where the service was good

278
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,640
number 54 cents a day earlier this year
but they're interested in doing it next

279
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,990
year to do it again this knowing that I
got more engaging to learn about

280
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,810
security through these events that
reductions had 10 good sign up again

281
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:15,210
when did I got out of his RCR industry
her she's actually played on the

282
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,810
greenhorn sited on technical side of the
longest we did all the training did

283
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:24,549
everything with you know that's higher
learning how to read through all the

284
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:32,320
configurations on that type of stuff how
to use the tools she took their to bug

285
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,760
in the code configuration that basically
allows people to you should have had

286
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,760
agreed only to certain pages

287
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:50,270
page we all know this whole system
they're going forward for 2016 to do

288
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:56,460
this again this is a problem with one of
the different ways that we can play the

289
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:02,050
games and all that through get
conclusive basically from the audience

290
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:07,510
just go to the website I give you up in
you play long guns gain some we do our

291
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:13,160
hands knees we do our various let's just
that type of stuff also play games right

292
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,580
there with you I he's straight from the
laptops and tablets to phones so just an

293
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:28,270
idea of something to do any questions so
far anything unless you look like a good

294
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:51,730
places to learn he stays very seriously
how come nobody works the tools they do

295
00:36:51,730 --> 00:37:01,360
everything is it a little stitch of
inspiration for trying to go to bed fine

296
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,890
line there is free for a little bit of
inspiration triangle doing so much time

297
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:13,509
we want to focus our energy on physical
training of very specific things to do

298
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:19,620
but we need to learn about how to wire
how to get people engaged you don't want

299
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,569
to do it for themselves

300
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:28,000
I did the lockpicking not suit I got
busted out in virus that is all that

301
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,790
type of stuff of why are we doing this
there is more or less just to get people

302
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:39,100
engaged I had work he does want to play
with our lives for high six times a day

303
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,060
drug company but it started the
conversation with them they came by my

304
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:49,180
desk wanna play sat down to talk for 15
minutes what's going on various things I

305
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:53,290
would never found out before because we
started a conversation because we

306
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:57,220
inspired deaf people engage in wanting
to find out about these things about

307
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:03,140
this game now that just opened the doors
for me from my perspective one person or

308
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:08,370
security concerns but also need to be
dropped my whole company I gotta rely on

309
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:19,290
them as much as I they rely on me to see
things so that's my my questions feel

310
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:29,440
free to flee

311
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:41,720
nothing big but it got more people at a
Sikh yup it goes like $25 to $125 you

312
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,240
later I got some money from today

313
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:57,470
$25 in black and i got more you know it
just just don't know that it was the end

314
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:02,770
of the other people so they probably got
more and it was just something no thanks

315
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:09,970
plane in my probably what we were doing
like things like the USB gains and buggy

316
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:17,450
you know that people may probably would
have played as much but then we had

317
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:26,850
another gift card for 14 her devotees

318
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:44,569
they want the perfect body is short stop
it helps I don't know that helps in
