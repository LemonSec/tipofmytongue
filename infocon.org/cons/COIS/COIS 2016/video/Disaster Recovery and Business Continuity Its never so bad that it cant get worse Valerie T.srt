1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,139
everybody here in the UK meharry region
of security consulting services for

2
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:17,240
secure a half Irish half Italian which
means I have to just stipulate 10 years

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:25,960
so we're going to talk about is doing a
review several different disaster

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,650
recovery and business continuity
planning on these are all taken from

5
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,189
from reality

6
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,300
two of the ones I'm gonna talk about
here I was the consultant coming in to

7
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,989
pick up the pieces after the disaster
one I was intimately involved in

8
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:52,149
developing it had left the company with
it was actually before they actually had

9
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:58,600
to be use and then we're going to look
at a few other things so some basic

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,800
agenda who we are

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,649
the magic of mixing technology and
humans you know one of the things that's

12
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:11,040
a constant in the in the security
romance you can upgrade policies you can

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,619
have great plans but people coming and
screw things up and is true in this

14
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,150
environment also will talk about things
the disaster recovery Institute

15
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:31,889
actually DRI international in the end of
the name some DRO talk about things they

16
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:40,770
tell you do three tales recommendations
and then look for someone once I just

17
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:47,340
find it interesting because it's the
aftermath of a disaster

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,240
company took a totally different per
inch

19
00:01:51,790 --> 00:02:00,270
that's worthwhile with some discussions
so quick one page advertisement near

20
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,850
secure account as a security consultancy
we do

21
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,020
mostly stuff and the critical
infrastructure regulated industry

22
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:21,740
utilities financial services from things
like I then in three years

23
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:29,500
feel strange to say I'm gonna working
longer than most of my stance has been a

24
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:38,930
line which is disturbing but over those
years do develop this broad range of

25
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,290
experience and actually doing plans and
be able to look at plans after the fact

26
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:53,560
when things don't go exactly like you
and the other thing just as a student of

27
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,930
security I'm always fascinated and
frankly amused by things but I call the

28
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:09,530
ETF have decent room which is buttered
toast always falls face when things fail

29
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:17,470
they usually fail to Cole's new the most
to stress so sorry about people were a

30
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,810
quick you know one of the issues and
security as I've said is your the mixing

31
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:32,340
technology and people so technology
makes a world work people make the world

32
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,590
we heard and business continuity happens
at the intersection of people on

33
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,489
technology with a disaster or two thrown
in the middle

34
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:48,420
just make things interesting so you can
do have the greatest plans in the world

35
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,290
that can be detail that can be
procedural eyes that can be you know

36
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:01,429
socialized to the community and the
disaster may not happen like you expect

37
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,080
that to happen so the key

38
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:12,800
is to be flexible in some cases very
very flexible so if you look at people

39
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,880
you know you can develop policies and
procedures and the basic assumption is

40
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,800
that people will do what you want them
to tell them but that's generally

41
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:39,100
correct people are constant emergency in
the in the middle of that kind of

42
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:46,520
unpredictable results I have the stop
sign their examples with just you know I

43
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,770
show of hands how many people always
come to a complete stop when they come

44
00:04:52,770 --> 00:05:02,789
to a stop sign anybody he got 10 usually
usually several people doing that and

45
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:09,780
I'll take a look at the room you know
about five percent of the people are

46
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,690
mistaken

47
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:20,780
lining and that's that's really but
that's reality that same phenomenon is

48
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:30,479
why social engineering were a phishing
attacks were the human animal so let's

49
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,760
talk about best intentions so we're
gonna talk about three case studies

50
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,800
three different industries three
different companies are there different

51
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,210
sizes all Sri had a business continuity
client

52
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:55,760
people knew about it they all had a
major failure when the disaster frankly

53
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,760
could then we'll look at a fourth case

54
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:09,160
so if you go through the PRI
methodologies and they give you some key

55
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:17,840
objectives one is safety so priority in
an emergency is cheap rich protect

56
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,299
people first and then worry about assets
and resources but having said that they

57
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:30,000
also throwing in a few other things like
keeping the business running you know

58
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,260
the idea of business is to to continue
operating so maintain basic

59
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:45,150
communications from a public relations
standpoint don't let you know your your

60
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:51,820
customers and vendors and your business
partners know that you've got an issue

61
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:59,060
you know keep communications normal
tried to avoid to the extent possible

62
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,060
and in any kind of disruption but
maintained billing accounting and keep

63
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,990
revenue flowing sitting in the middle

64
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:16,850
disaster here in the need money to fix
it becomes important but more things

65
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:26,040
they go into a is the idea of being able
to have strategies that can handle a

66
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,430
variety of different things so having
emergency response operations

67
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:38,040
contingency have a detailed plan of what
your gonna do

68
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:46,340
haven't situational we get a pandemic we
do this you know we hit by a meteor we

69
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,070
do this actually for getting hit by a
meteor you probably a bigger concern but

70
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:58,200
just just be able to to mix and match
different pieces to accommodate

71
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,430
different different situations you may
have one thing that most companies fail

72
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,310
went bad

73
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:12,590
glee is training and awareness of the
business continuity and that's vital

74
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,799
especially for the staff this actually
expected to pull it off

75
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:24,140
usually call list or some kind of
hierarchy who's going to declare the

76
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:32,319
emergency who's going to to take
responsibility for getting the you know

77
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,860
the plan executed and it would be a
really good idea if those players knew

78
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:48,620
what was expected them telling them and
training them is really important and

79
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,120
that's really the next point

80
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,760
maintaining and testing the play a lot
of companies have plans some of them

81
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,610
have hearing detail plans but there
never tested so when the disaster

82
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:12,750
actually happens you get a carnival of
different things going on PRI public

83
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:19,400
relations and crisis communications is
vital but especially true if you're a

84
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,610
public company

85
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:27,510
you don't want to appear on page 1 the
financial times and then

86
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:32,319
depending on the nature of the thing
coordinating with public authorities

87
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:41,429
police fire emergency responders things
so the three things looked at is the

88
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:46,559
other 911 issue everybody knows what
happened when I know but that wasn't the

89
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,129
only thing going on that you should have
a hint from the graphic there

90
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:59,290
the other thing was one looking at
people you know one of the plans you

91
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:06,988
know most companies business continuity
and disaster recovery point against have

92
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:12,610
the idea of declaring an emergency
somewhere you know going to a backup

93
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:18,069
site having people were removed things
like that there's another approach which

94
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:28,519
is shelter-in-place have the facilities
and resources that you need in place so

95
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:33,029
that you can you don't have to go
anywhere you just hunker down and stay

96
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:40,920
for the duration most DOD datacenters
work under that scheme and then we'll

97
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,128
talk about financial services and 12 K

98
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:53,619
remember y2k we'll talk more about that
in a minute so the other 911 issue is

99
00:10:53,619 --> 00:11:02,149
hurricane debris all remember hurricane
Gabrielle so september ninth tropical

100
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:10,860
storm to a tropical depression crosses
the the middle of Florida wanders into

101
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,999
the Gulf become tropical storm

102
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:23,939
Rio on the 9th of September on September
11th comes back on sure you look for in

103
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:32,299
a heading west to east company I was
working with at the time because of the

104
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:33,520
previous rain

105
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:41,319
free tropical storm issue they were they
were in was already set so the ground

106
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:48,760
couldn't take anymore and you gonna
category 1 hurricane coming so they had

107
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:56,439
a plan they had a contract with a name
disaster recovery organization their

108
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:03,710
schedules site to move to with sterling
forest New York but because of other

109
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,150
things that were going on the morning of
911 they couldn't get them the answer

110
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,470
the phone

111
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:17,660
everybody from was also trying to get
there so their request neither the

112
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:27,510
communication they received the request
could not be accommodated so this is the

113
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:35,130
new plan when you fail to plan you plan
to fail so they were a small company in

114
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:42,030
the manufacturing and a plan which they
had never tested the head of the army

115
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:47,610
contract with somebody told them that
was a good idea but their approach was

116
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:53,070
let's keep all our backup tapes on sign
so that when we have an emergency

117
00:12:53,070 --> 00:13:03,100
weekend just the truck that's what I've
heard get them to the DR site and will

118
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:11,110
be ok well for the DR site if you've
ever one of those contracts with

119
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:18,170
involved in most DR site contracts you
tell them what kind of equipment and

120
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,240
what configuration

121
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,610
your software isn't loaded your data so
you're really going up there with an

122
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:37,580
expectation of all I have to do with my
backup to restore them and may well have

123
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,760
ever tried to do in practice if we're
trying to do a bare metal

124
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,250
rebuilding database or When You're
Expecting two-day turnaround you will be

125
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,960
disappointed so they had great
expectations

126
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:02,660
never tested it and it didn't work so
with the emphasis plan was iffy that

127
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:08,260
they could pull it off in the first
place if you ever bother to read the

128
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:16,740
verbiage they are contract there is an
escape clause which we don't guarantee

129
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:25,780
that you can actually execute faster
when you want to do we have the right to

130
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:33,560
say I'm sorry you know they'll give you
your money back or at least credit but

131
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:43,739
you know it's a long story short but
they decided they were out for a while

132
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:51,240
so let's talk about different approach
than the traditional Dr in small-company

133
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:58,860
Dr slide my migration this other one is
a manufacturing company in new england

134
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:06,960
they had made specialty paper products
for medical purposes

135
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:18,680
stuffings 44 bandages things so nice
rolling doing one countryside where he

136
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,370
put the picturesque area they took a
shelter-in-place approach and went to

137
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:33,260
great pains and very detailed and well
thought-out approach on how to do that

138
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,980
they maintained their cups on site but
also

139
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:45,209
off-site capability they had redundant
equipment so they could they could

140
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:50,899
really swap equipment on site in fairly
short order as they needed to be even

141
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:57,690
had food and the different things to to
drink of water on site with the

142
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,540
expectation that they had a major
disaster they'd only be out a couple of

143
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,310
days so they had about you know for five
days of stuff on site

144
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:15,630
interesting data center natural gas
generator tied to the municipal gas

145
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:23,000
supply so as long as they had gas and
power they had the Virgin network

146
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,110
connections from two different carriers
coming in the building

147
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:34,000
good BGP routing so they could swap
between them as if they had two things

148
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,269
were engineered systems around in there
so that all of their critical systems

149
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:45,839
can be accessed remotely very little
need for the operations that have to be

150
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:52,199
on site there were some functions had to
be manually attended the trigger those

151
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:59,889
will be prioritized during an emergency
and they have the access road access

152
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:06,429
they constantly tested routinely tested
when they make changes to any of the

153
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:14,669
environments they would test led to so
Donald Trump giving them a big thumbs up

154
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:24,220
so they did their homework but there if
you were actually read their documents

155
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,439
they were they were very much a

156
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:38,340
will do do you know very very narrowly
defined roles and they said you know

157
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:46,189
eventually will cross train everybody ok
but the disaster King before were

158
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:54,870
later in May of 2006 massive flooding in
the area

159
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:01,979
telecommunications from pollution there
somewhere where were out roads were

160
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:09,780
impassable and the residents were
evacuated but their systems were up no

161
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,100
one could get to the site

162
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,139
put the systems are up they discovered
many francis's that they had not

163
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:23,760
considered that needed to be human loyal
interacted with they also discovered

164
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,310
that their phone system and their
physical access controls the badging

165
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,840
system to get into the facility

166
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:42,320
the backup power supply so your system
is up the rest of the building our own

167
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:52,419
why it was a magnetic law bill failed
approach so anybody if you could take a

168
00:18:52,420 --> 00:19:02,540
boat and get to their facility you could
just walk in there but he did but it was

169
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:08,480
a good plan didn't quite far enough you
know cross-training of people become

170
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:16,630
absolutely vital that particular type of
plan would have helped them much in this

171
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:24,260
particular instance because the people
were all evacuated out of the area so

172
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:30,530
was this really a successful they are
playing you know they totally

173
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:36,230
inaccessible for for a couple of days
but they were within their outage for a

174
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:43,100
couple of days window so that was all
automated processes ran but there was

175
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:48,540
physically nobody in the building at all
for three days while the systems were

176
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,110
running

177
00:19:49,110 --> 00:20:03,740
accessible so let's talk about the other
to the first to talk with us

178
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,850
consultant helping them figure out what
went wrong

179
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,059
12 K I worked for a large financial
services company orange globally

180
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:22,020
recognized company primary data center
was a southern Connecticut backup data

181
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:29,500
center was so good two hundred-mile
stretch had standing hotel

182
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:35,590
accommodations both data centers to
house people in the event of an

183
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:44,570
emergency we build over the course of a
year and a half we built the y2k

184
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:51,970
business continuity plan in work you
will know all of the application owners

185
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:59,490
across the company had come through and
prioritize things so we could say in

186
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:07,440
great detail if this happened these
people go here these people you work

187
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,679
from home

188
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:15,710
have laptops issued to them we had
arrangements set up for temporary space

189
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:27,260
if we needed it was a great detail plan
and all 1999 testing almost every

190
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:40,790
weekend my wife was working on on
testing different aspects of the plan

191
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,620
different scenario work great

192
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:56,510
monthly failover a market system so we
went from the primary data centers in

193
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:02,559
Connecticut we would fail over for a
whole week every month to the the back

194
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,480
at the summer I was for the network
business systems were lower priority

195
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:16,190
should look at new york new york within
three locations one Liberty Plaza Times

196
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:23,530
Square just off a wall street we had a
plan for if staff had to be evacuated

197
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:33,650
each location across the country if
staff had to be relocated figure out

198
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,900
where they would have to go what
resources would come with them what

199
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:43,860
services would go what services would be
deferred was emplacements tested as

200
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:57,129
great as granular was situational for a
ride to nothing but then there was 911

201
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:06,880
so that was the plan that was in place
with the Trade Center attack happened

202
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:15,050
one would re-deploy your lunch at the
time is literally across the street from

203
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:23,350
the site of the World Trade Center so
the building was compromised so first

204
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:29,469
plane hit so it's 815 in the morning
when the first plane hit stock market

205
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,720
was an open at that point

206
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,230
stock markets that shows up at six to
start bringing system testing integrity

207
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:44,830
which were before market open so the New
York staff was already there was already

208
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,159
on site

209
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,070
getting ready for market has things
unfolded

210
00:23:53,750 --> 00:24:05,120
we decided to evacuate the Liberty Plaza
Mall Street staff transferred the backup

211
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,320
site without a hitch and we figured
there would be a long-term displacement

212
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,159
of the workforce

213
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:20,670
cause of the situation so on the one
level the plan was successful

214
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:29,399
seamless transition on the network so
this particular company was all

215
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:40,230
electronic within the trading floor so
things just transfer market systems are

216
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:47,110
actually ready to go from backups a
normal market but for a variety of

217
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,199
reasons I decided not to

218
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:56,950
to actually do that the backups in the
system we're also issues at the pentagon

219
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:07,010
that morning but they decided to keep
the market closed closed for like the

220
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:15,750
next two weeks there were staff injuries
but no real reported fatalities why were

221
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:23,360
their staff injuries it's because people
if you're working in a building across

222
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:31,899
the street from a major disaster you do
go out so there was a fairly large

223
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:38,500
contingent of people you know from the
One Liberty Plaza sign from the wall

224
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,810
street's only about four or five blocks
away

225
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,750
who came down

226
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:55,250
watching the South Tower fell the
injured by debris people will be people

227
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:05,740
so they were plans with the problem with
the the plan while we had a fairly

228
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,130
detailed situational plan in place

229
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,550
losing Manhattan was not one of the
situations

230
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,750
evacuation plan for the building of
certain streets would be clear public

231
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:29,810
transportation will be available and
where the to keep in mind that this is

232
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:38,750
the board wanted to keep not the 911
plan we had called in the plan for all

233
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,170
these laptops to be available

234
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:48,230
well they never pressured from nineteen
ever so they didn't have didn't have the

235
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:53,620
laptops but that was ok because I also
didn't help the VPN licenses to support

236
00:26:53,620 --> 00:27:03,530
the more remote places workforce one
that you know sometimes you get lucky

237
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:12,830
the both the AT&T New York City switch
Sundaram most cellular service was a man

238
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:18,189
it's from the top of the world trade
center when they also the they lost that

239
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:24,240
but they use them for their or WorldCom
as it was at the time for their

240
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:31,450
networking and it was just simply routed
around New York I was not a design

241
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:38,760
feature that was dumb luck so things to
think about you know so things to

242
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:47,360
remember from the drills are training is
an important you know it's my opinion

243
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,428
annual

244
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:56,249
drills are simply not frequently enough
if your company is still doing

245
00:27:56,249 --> 00:28:02,909
incremental backups were probably
inadequate should rethink your backup

246
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:07,389
strategy because having those in the
right place at the right time to be

247
00:28:07,389 --> 00:28:17,539
restored quickly set through an
incremental restore process so I've got

248
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:26,408
my my full backup and then a month of
incremental on top of that takes an

249
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:31,950
incredible amount of time if you gonna
do bare metal restore zone on servers

250
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,789
practices

251
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:40,190
understand what time systems uvula
transactional systems database systems

252
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:49,779
play games with journal entries so being
able to understand what you're seeing

253
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:56,220
what the girls are in resolving them
quickly can save you some cases weeks

254
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:03,320
out of out of recovery when you get
there and if you're using a third-party

255
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:33,470
backup thing you know you know some of
course you have understood what you have

256
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:39,639
to do to get operational and if you make
changes in your production make sure

257
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:45,289
those are incorporated that into the
into the equipment requirements for the

258
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:53,700
disaster site one of the things we tried
to do with the last play on the y2k

259
00:29:53,700 --> 00:30:01,230
playing his identify everything that we
thought was coming after us you will not

260
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:12,860
be successful in identifying everything
you can do a good job of having options

261
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:19,449
that you may not have otherwise getting
the right people and the right stuff to

262
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:27,480
the backups and anything you have to
bring with you to the backup site is

263
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:35,100
vital and maintain the equipment you
know it's not good if you show up at the

264
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:43,560
disaster recovery site and you've got
all the old systems don't have enough

265
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:49,230
memory or you're gone

266
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:56,410
virtualized but that's not reflected in
your your your backup site that can

267
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:04,280
cause you interesting things and above
all frustrating people you know have the

268
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:11,629
teams trained on on what the
expectations are you won't know for sure

269
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:17,110
who's actually going to show up if
anybody did you know to run system than

270
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:20,110
you know when you're in a disaster

271
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:36,740
this answers never quite happened as you
expect to so be ready for half disaster

272
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:42,429
but also be ready for multiple disasters
just because you're being beaten up by a

273
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:48,889
hurricane doesn't mean you can also get
hit by the media so you know so have the

274
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:54,258
idea of different options you have

275
00:31:55,259 --> 00:32:01,149
situational planning is important you
know just because you're having one

276
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:06,479
issue doesn't mean I declare an
emergency and everything to do with the

277
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,919
front sight no try to be a little more
more granular and you know it's

278
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:21,190
expensive to move to a backup site one
of the costs of business continuity

279
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:31,499
planning execution is coming back a lot
of places though they recognize you know

280
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:34,499
while you're productions over there

281
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:41,200
changes their mantra modifications
that's that's been done those that have

282
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,499
to be reflected back in the production
systems when you come back it's not

283
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:50,919
flipping a switch you know all the pain
that you went through to move out you've

284
00:32:50,919 --> 00:33:03,149
got at least that coming back something
similar to that one the one litter

285
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:12,239
changed was what what we had was the the
the tree diagram from hell

286
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:22,359
we would have to do in the last one was
a box labeled OCIs the which was

287
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:30,749
approved that something so what have a
strategy you know recognized you may not

288
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:41,909
have a person sweet what you know what's
what's available to you in a side story

289
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:47,779
one of my other clients so I I left the
financial services company in the

290
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:58,759
beginning of 2009 the company I was with
after or doing security systems for a

291
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:08,299
variety of of clients including cosmetic
company most people don't realize is

292
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:12,639
because many companies are one of the
biggest consumers of security technology

293
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:19,599
on the planet as they have secret
formulas they have R&D centers they do

294
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:28,770
they often become targets activist
groups for animal testing and things so

295
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:35,250
this particular company had a there they
had to research and development

296
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:40,020
facilities which were high-security
facilities for them one was in

297
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:48,629
morristown new jersey one was in East
Fritz yes the French River Europe so the

298
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:55,618
idea of cost cutting measure will take
the European researchers and expand the

299
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:06,220
facility in New Jersey so after 911 they
decided to stop the company I was

300
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:14,939
working for his work in the ER and the
facility at the stop and convert the New

301
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,859
Jersey office

302
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:25,180
executives from manhattan down to
central New Jersey and I'm just bring

303
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:35,549
this up because I was example of taking
a disaster or reacting to it in a way to

304
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:42,349
reduce your risk but I've always
wondered if the R&D team from the French

305
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:50,420
Riviera was really force behind removing
me from the French Riviera to Morristown

306
00:35:50,420 --> 00:36:00,019
New Jersey so conclusions if you get
nothing else out of this test refine

307
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:06,508
repeat be flexible disasters what
happened while you expect them to when

308
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:12,099
it does happen you'll find out what
pieces you didn't test enough and one of

309
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:16,900
my favorite quotes from General George
Patton is when the first shot is fired

310
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:29,009
battle plans go out the window so will
be open for questions and we doing a

311
00:36:29,009 --> 00:36:44,099
question you get nine minutes but he
screwed up for everybody

312
00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:00,799
interesting something to think about

313
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:11,920
there is a bunch of convergence but in
convergence technologies that are

314
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,529
happening if you look at the traditional
building building right you know the

315
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:24,160
you have your enterprise that were doing
enterprise stuff but

316
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:34,119
modern buildings things like he HVAC
system power distribution for the

317
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:39,520
building increasingly those are
network-based you know so when you start

318
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:47,750
talking about you know disaster recovery
and moving coming back there's a whole

319
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:52,420
bunch of things that may be on your
network that you don't know about you

320
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:58,630
know devices you know if you look at my
door controllers for access and access

321
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:04,670
control so you know you just run a scan
or that may look like your web server

322
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:08,829
services home port 80

323
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:13,930
you know if you don't drill into that
device to see what it is

324
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:26,460
it'll just look what some something
given a web interface so you have to be

325
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:33,030
increasingly aware of both physical
security and building automation

326
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:42,950
kind of stuff so so it is expanding the
real killer of always fall back on

327
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:47,618
people though yes

328
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:35,220
but recognized as a private company
owned private cloud you know those

329
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:43,209
servers are you may be subject to the
cloud providers Backup Recovery

330
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:55,310
prioritization scheme you look at some
of the AWS outages you would have been

331
00:39:55,310 --> 00:40:03,549
several years ago there were two jewish
basically gone for you for for a couple

332
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:09,240
of days if that's your backup site and
you're not having disaster that's

333
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,810
acceptable but you know if that's the
becomes your production environment

334
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:25,330
that's a wonderful thing so most of the
world according to me know most

335
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:31,859
companies don't really understand the
the SLA and continuing season in their

336
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:39,369
cloud drum tracks and that's something
that should change you know this before

337
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:42,369
the incident

338
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:54,830
so an example when I left the financial
services company lowered by the big

339
00:41:54,830 --> 00:42:03,250
money in fast times of a.com and so I
was VP of security for this company I

340
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:13,970
did their disaster recovery plan we did
monthly tests and tests were randomly

341
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:25,669
personal failures you know so you know
not moving everything the ones but you

342
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,230
know a california-based company so take
me earthquakes in the area

343
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:37,330
take the tsunami said you know russia's
attack scenario we were doing the

344
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:49,890
systems for the 2002 Salt Lake so we had
no activists so consistent testing but

345
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:56,129
if you have a granular plan you can
limit the testing and expense and

346
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:59,130
disruption to the business

347
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,420
22 just a small portion of the
environment

348
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,520
think there was one in there

349
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:33,050
for my experience most of it is done in
the house importantly it's I think

350
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:40,550
people tend to be too close to the
things you get your favorite systems you

351
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,980
know we need email up first

352
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:55,230
million or we need one of the classic
ones is payroll system they want and

353
00:43:55,230 --> 00:44:01,140
unfortunately it's not they charge and
payroll you know are or not

354
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:19,440
first priorities people don't like your
other question it's not thank you very

355
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:19,650
much
