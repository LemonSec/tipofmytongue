1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,810
so is waging Valtteri these are my
television late involved in the earlier

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:21,788
you get so welcome wagons were more than
working in technology and some capacity

3
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,850
over 15 years when I was young

4
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,750
what I'd like to do is turn around and
go figure

5
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:35,350
cool Mary tax stuff to do was higher at
the open source and at the time most of

6
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:42,260
the information security was open source
told CNN dallas and enjoying offers me

7
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,210
things

8
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,210
nasa's with a trip wire was if it soars

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,289
ration it was before all these vendors
who are some of this stuff out with his

10
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:55,079
hands

11
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:04,360
technologies multiuser technologies ISPs
yes I i've been warranty as well

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:13,020
operations and security and rear tire
was fifty years ago as the culinary

13
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,140
thing to do pretty much these days it's
all paperwork so GRC is seems as my time

14
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,640
and

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:35,119
relative to find out what clothes and as
well I feel a couple of high-performing

16
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,040
season so that's really where my
background house from I help companies

17
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:47,450
kill their technology and teams I work
with my mess welfare and before that to

18
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:55,780
check out my presentation is going to be
broader as early as you kind of us that

19
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,940
much of you it's really not necessarily
close your eyes like this on the agenda

20
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:12,489
is far foundation executive for forty
percent exactly that they can give it to

21
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:18,900
a little more technical stuff like to
feel free to consider any questions

22
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,239
about that there was the tax is
something I makes us more than happy to

23
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:35,280
speak so the folks here still awake so
that's great year with an organization

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,600
will consider cell technology because
this or any technology fried

25
00:02:52,100 --> 00:03:05,940
all I hear is expecting this information
security so many different question how

26
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,329
many of the folks here just do this
typology of this information security

27
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:21,900
things boss once you have okayed over he
wants to be more information security

28
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:30,970
and technology in technology business
and that's a big part of what I'm going

29
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,070
to be talking about as far as practices

30
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,720
approaches to information security so
however herschel

31
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:51,040
this is out against versus all of the
Scot

32
00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:01,880
artists who is a little bit so how to
make things just me if you wear things

33
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:09,500
so I think secure with other ways we
keep things secure encryption encryption

34
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:22,830
huge fire in this general other things
we do techniques were used to keep

35
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:34,090
things secure 0 trust in 10 trust now
access control or physical artifacts

36
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:49,580
physical security separation into it he
is their education that's huge he said

37
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,990
the voice

38
00:04:51,990 --> 00:05:08,100
one lawyer 23 ish so all these things
are true and security of them come down

39
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:17,770
to restricting access control in the
industry and there is always great

40
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:29,460
approach things is so so just close to
you please so I T years back

41
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,669
professional perspective pretty much
came out three years and even still in a

42
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:47,480
lot of his age I hear there's a lot of
security patrols as well a lot of

43
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,360
security controls came out of finance
and accounting and well separation of

44
00:05:52,360 --> 00:06:04,090
duties and accounted for issuing checks
you had a set of other international

45
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:12,179
security patrols crossing the road is
down their reaction to find this is

46
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,550
still hasn't been roped into creative
places I can't take credit for having

47
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,020
the right of the stellar

48
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:28,070
so traditional security controls can
slowly organization that a little

49
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:38,140
some keys so couple stories first
security bill I didn't know what the

50
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:43,270
stuff was not not from the perspective
of having years of experience i

51
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:51,549
certainly we need access to draw change
control decks started really like of

52
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,960
course lightweight processes

53
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,090
organization grew over 10 years where is
widely

54
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:10,730
I love to tell the story so literally
used to get high tech forum basically

55
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:16,250
somebody to play something it literally
turned into a pile of papers this is a

56
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:26,230
new technology or the paper had a list
of files changed his initial test

57
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:34,540
engineer software engineer initialing
awful pages on it is so late on these

58
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,120
pages

59
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,160
various block as soon as you're so you
have to walk around this country person

60
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:51,970
or organisation is a test engineering
manager software engineering manager so

61
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,210
as you might expect in this
hundred-person organization even better

62
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,760
pile of paper it was candid then
submitted to it then somebody else has

63
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:08,300
risen organization someone else has
ticket it was a very quick to get some

64
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,790
changes in a while

65
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:21,300
that's really not the Christmas story
may care is that these processes grow

66
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:33,870
bill this whole winter their own
overtime I question the value I do

67
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,370
appreciate in value

68
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:42,580
trading records changes is seen that if
you look back and tied the actual change

69
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:52,040
may be here for the folks in the US who
eschewed a little bit to make it easier

70
00:08:52,040 --> 00:09:10,829
for photographs in a pic to show there's
plenty of space in here right out front

71
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:21,100
organization being slow for technology
or this issue where technology is too

72
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,880
slow

73
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:37,230
pictures to your product it doesn't take
very light speed things up early this is

74
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:44,590
where I want us to most time with you
talking about ways we can keep it secure

75
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:52,320
really available and secure those are
two things I think things will secure

76
00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:00,380
scalable to all operations there so
let's drill separation of duties 2012

77
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,350
after tax changes for the five percent
of you who work in technology

78
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,390
decisions you probably know this
heretics for the other 95% of an

79
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:17,480
organization school really smart
engineers who has a lot of fun playing

80
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,870
with their ecology and takes them we
make a simple change it

81
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:49,850
tell you whether you were very long and
silent all these things that things we

82
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:57,910
want information security practitioners
do the things we want to tax i dont want

83
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:09,839
two hundred and year's title log in our
room are really user long as we all know

84
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:18,650
and probably addition tools allow us
access the system is still in power

85
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:35,140
tools and create tractors so long my
favorite things to do change that person

86
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,160
or actually tell you what it's like a
signature sunglasses

87
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:55,800
signing off relay 200 application or the
details of what I love they were not

88
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,959
really in a position

89
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:08,810
so is a much more active review and
approval process and how you manage your

90
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:15,160
teacher teaching stop doing that

91
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:28,839
dimension to enforce our control
processes nobody has to change that

92
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:41,920
there's a sec

93
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:52,189
technology plus out there yes a lot of
their coat and a lot of the things

94
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:59,779
digital as well as good as crap so check
it out sometime there's all sorts of

95
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:11,709
this when people versus there's one but
the boys it's really easy to do any 12

96
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:23,550
they're not bridge is practices are more
cognizant technology so it's kind of a

97
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:34,260
buzzword right now that's really what
that does is brings together so these

98
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:40,079
are the kind of things that adopt its
information security people we have an

99
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:46,829
opportunity here to train more to the
table from our perspective to enable

100
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:49,829
better security

101
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,319
a little more details for systems with
figuration

102
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:05,320
not just application for its changing a
tempest rush all these practices can be

103
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:14,090
applied universally acknowledged system
configuration management applications to

104
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:19,450
pouring the whole area was integration
tenuous integration is often the

105
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:30,760
district St but actually make sure all
the security tests so it's likely just

106
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:42,569
as much doesn't it can be at St toys
even doing this a long time

107
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,700
technology that's not what they need
thing about source code management is a

108
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:56,250
source of a record for a change at the
height of the at me she told the police

109
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:14,670
that she ties to the source control
there's so much competition rules out a

110
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:20,360
little stronger true martin Fallin's
then

111
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:32,659
is there's a lot of others don't have
experience working with organizations

112
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:38,869
like this because it's homey more
recently where more regulated industry

113
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:46,719
has found itself in the position where
it needs to be and that's really where

114
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:54,749
the others swear a lot of folks and the
fact that I've been in a fitness company

115
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:55,589
now

116
00:15:55,589 --> 00:16:31,339
healthcare industry is it so we're going
into 2016 14 the boys so if we're

117
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:36,319
talking value many tools like this not
only is their value from a security

118
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:41,929
perspective because we have way more all
over the consistency production there's

119
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:50,348
a lot of value to business as changes
and Australia have a much more effective

120
00:16:50,349 --> 00:17:00,829
organization even as an organization you
are not using technology as a

121
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:04,009
competitive advantage

122
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:14,429
much more effective operation which has
a huge value but why take even if you're

123
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,929
not as her college your position

124
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:24,579
technologies used as an additive it back
and if you're not your company and your

125
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,430
industry

126
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:35,660
many years short years there's one
industry that is this going to be

127
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:49,410
challenging for those who are talking a
little marvelous so there's holes out of

128
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:58,490
here just listen quite catastrophic to
plane engines get up very bad out these

129
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:06,010
all serve different purposes of issues
tied to enable this process which I'd

130
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:14,120
expect me you know about this autonomy
the source code scanner really focus on

131
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:23,120
this source and if you preferred vendor
must have the most supportive so so

132
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,389
really this is a way for information
security to align itself and work with

133
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:35,380
more innovative sisters as an issue I
most certainly will be tied to drug test

134
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:42,490
the business enabling more effective and
more secure in these are ways to do this

135
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:49,440
I assist we can do this with this is a
white whale this is a really difficult

136
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,480
thing to do and that's all the more
reason why I think I've seen it done

137
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,480
nearly perfect

138
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:09,370
accesses want there was once as well
access data only and as the structure

139
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:16,330
must developers on the database side
many of them would like access to do

140
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:28,020
this and the reason I hear most common
issues course there's always an

141
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:34,990
opportunity there's always an
alternative solution there's an

142
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:40,910
automation solution for did a business
process

143
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:51,510
business intelligence and reporting
tools and then there's a business

144
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,250
developer areas there's an Operations
arson if there's a non-technical person

145
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:02,190
and you are as a nation in sacks as to
the date of his decision or change your

146
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,540
business

147
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:09,250
V-eight will enable that very well and
that's the way taxes without accessing

148
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:14,740
the database directly or you seen her
physical security controls are logical

149
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:26,820
also a way to obstruct access on a day
later it was if you're doing it sheler

150
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:39,389
structure and spoons and analytics
databases all these things you know all

151
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:46,880
this office is not here so that's the
business side effects production

152
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:54,500
troubleshooting side of things we see
that i truly think this is

153
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:00,470
just about every organization needs to
be the biggest challenge ever got

154
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,690
scrubbing

155
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:09,960
if you're telling what terrifies them
are challenging logistics of it all is

156
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,830
lost her longtime visit technology
solution for that suffered instance

157
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,540
scrubbed it all investors with Mr fishy
are obviously if you really gonna get

158
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:34,399
another business work out what your
credit card numbers table doesn't need

159
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:43,910
to be sure like to wake one relatively
speaking a separate instance development

160
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:48,340
innovate automation processes to enable
that that's the perfect solution

161
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:56,909
nice two separate stints has value
performance testing is one of just heard

162
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:06,460
the technology to have a four year old
hottie is certainly not what the

163
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:22,700
confidential information that I needed
only this year and it's small sees her

164
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,970
organization has been around for a long
time

165
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,700
well when any organizational change this
is true

166
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,120
big small pilot project this new product

167
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:40,330
much easier to do from the ground up I'm
not sure this year's talking about

168
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,230
things that are difficult to do or say
hi guys still big deal we've actually

169
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:52,620
done all of this recovery and publish
the tools to enable it one of the things

170
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,620
we do is open source technology and
stuff like that

171
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:03,980
one of the memories currency fill this
application and serious Chris quality

172
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,990
beautiful air which enables status
change control using automation and made

173
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:23,679
him a dataset and see how to production
from Dell pass the time so it's been

174
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:30,730
done you can even go with really
appreciated as you contribute back but

175
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:37,179
you don't have to it's an MIT license
you can do whatever you always get out

176
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:46,250
there were doing it right now so there's
always this is a big part of my back

177
00:23:46,880 --> 00:24:20,600
PCI on time and work out there that is
pretty sure all things Davis level there

178
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:27,750
is a solution for every client's
landscape there is a control solution

179
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,750
for every environment

180
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:30,080
are you plan and all the different in
almost all cases there's a solution one

181
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,409
of my favorite dishes with you a talking
about for several years how it aligns

182
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:45,370
very boring if you have information in
your email you probably need to take a

183
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,090
closer look

184
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:52,918
but if I slid his license for your
corporate power have no access control

185
00:25:52,919 --> 00:26:00,799
of technical issues babe ministry and
get a big pile also heard what he wants

186
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:08,520
to talk about and throw it out the
window is really that is that big of a

187
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,049
risk to your organization

188
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:21,110
lot of time on that you got some most
viewed you live here but I think that's

189
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:28,479
an example or something relates there's
examples for everything and everything

190
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:37,330
is just a matter of finding the best way
to do we talked about earlier

191
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:50,070
the twenty-eight rules and stuff like
that those are controls that empower

192
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,668
different parts of the organization

193
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:17,620
hurts way over here in the superscript
very low level encryption and again

194
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:23,299
there's a solution to everything well
most of the other organizations other

195
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:36,929
parts of the technology aren't going to
be affected by that story and what they

196
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:41,090
took your new school in isolation
extreme example is there any congress

197
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:48,750
where they sell some money and that's
what they do they waited her with a

198
00:27:48,750 --> 00:28:03,440
choir even so far and so every other
position even PC Island hundreds of the

199
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:12,500
day two of the things that make them one
of the technology solutions so whenever

200
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:25,289
there is just need to step back next
florida was doing school and isolate or

201
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:39,908
do something like the Eiffel many of the
other examples earlier GRC for many

202
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:43,110
people drive shoppers compliance

203
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:52,370
in a regulated industry

204
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:58,570
care or any of the others where the
average company and the industry is

205
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:03,010
having challenges because of regulation
there's

206
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:13,410
with security control your information
security program lines of the regulation

207
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,010
in the industry

208
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:29,290
make an organization more competitive
than 95% of the other car hire retain

209
00:29:34,830 --> 00:30:06,929
made a protein marks road network

210
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,910
practice a lot of

211
00:30:11,660 --> 00:31:12,980
it is always one of those areas we're
pretty sure this is what you see in

212
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:18,890
those cases can say okay this role this
group of people in operations as a

213
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:28,380
business you build the controls around
this does this is unique in all the

214
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:34,270
personnel management such as background
checks such in the hiring process is

215
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:42,700
stronger and the organization said no
means is that they want to see those are

216
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:49,680
pretty strong and in cases where there's
an organization established more

217
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:57,790
traditional there are opportunities to
fall back on things that resemble a more

218
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:02,260
traditional controls that are enabled
with technology tools and things like

219
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:10,310
that last procedures where the
technology is still our people that is

220
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:18,620
building a little extra points in the
process so about places though so we

221
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,168
know

222
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:35,960
throat surgeon dr.

223
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:47,369
thinking I'll tell you what there is a
ton of the news that our love to talk

224
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:54,959
about this subject and so very oceans in
my experience it's just hard work he's

225
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,889
doing the exercises going through the
Organization of culture security takes

226
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:08,129
time because and the organization as we
are to do exactly that it can be done I

227
00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:12,498
probably not are helpful but I'd be
happy to discuss in more detail outside

228
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:20,649
of this particular questions so whether
that on so what I found this that's

229
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:27,949
actually one of the more things that
happen when you accelerate is today I

230
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:33,919
shops are moving so slow business units
to shatter build these applications

231
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:45,529
drives talks by accelerating and doing
this very rapid cuts the need for the

232
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:52,070
shadow of bill and it drives the data
infrastructure and back off the desktops

233
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,908
so you know people go over too risky

234
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:05,230
viewers actually accelerated you mean
when you don't do it on their desktops

235
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,839
and that price it is really really
actually

236
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:15,429
various social

237
00:34:54,550 --> 00:35:10,579
has a design that enables the production
and insistence way up to a lot of yummy

238
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:11,220
asian

239
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:19,700
we use your eyes as if equipped with her
as well while the environment for system

240
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:28,270
side of things is going to differ
between the environment and we are the

241
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:38,329
types of has some organizations to have
you on the issues in configuration

242
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:52,940
management and other systems management
why so so all is well enough he

243
00:35:52,940 --> 00:36:02,520
religious states I love everything but
there's companies right at once just

244
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:17,780
building using first appointment process
enables very troubling you have for two

245
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,700
more questions there's nobody in the
room after

246
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,089
so we can go a little long but I
wouldn't want to take away from your

247
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:30,828
great presentation so 14 bill today I do
you go back and decipher which one of

248
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:37,530
the 14 may break something if it has a
trickle-down effect other enhancements

249
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,450
that are reported each vehicle bills
during a given time thank you

250
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:53,089
process automation which is great I
washed it we haven't told that I really

251
00:36:53,089 --> 00:37:01,630
want to open source we will eventually
help W was her mission tools for the

252
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:13,710
process similar to that specific to a
seal so this whole enable process part

253
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:22,200
of it primarily because there's triggers
cross-functional operations get the

254
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,040
notice

255
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,040
understand the path to communicate with
certain

256
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:41,279
so great how to process this could work
through that's tied to our automation

257
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:51,180
tools from my perspective we're still
building honored and I think I have a

258
00:37:51,180 --> 00:38:04,470
much better story and you're so I think
that answer your question

259
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:34,160
like to deduct where a
business-to-business company and we

260
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:41,170
operate very much behind the scenes with
prior so try other positions in central

261
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:50,090
or insurers haver medication so this
process involves pharmacies physicians

262
00:38:50,090 --> 00:39:01,770
insurance company so it's very much
built modern technology what protocols

263
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:09,800
and what level of different countries
for the process

264
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:26,420
pharmacy dispensing systems are even a
user as a right so thanks so much for

265
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,510
the question is really good actually
give me some ideas for building on this

266
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:40,580
presentation so if you have is here so
any recommendations are you think there

267
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,319
was something

268
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:59,150
why leave my nose amor awesome or are
you back this presentation specifically

269
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:02,580
for you

270
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:07,180
plans get it again so your feedback will
help me make it better and i really

271
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:14,230
appreciate that a lot of the community's
cover my magic we're hiring them I'm

272
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:21,270
esta com in the communities chris-craft
technology blog I hope my mess we open

273
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:26,560
source all sorts of stop if it is not
the primary so the software and it's not

274
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,730
our primary product we are going to
sources if this that's what it's worth

275
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,890
more often than not one of the stores
and even if it's not in the Commission's

276
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:42,420
decision yourself like that script grab
we talk about the things we're doing

277
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:47,400
these articles that DVD deploy and other
things as well if you'd like to eat or

278
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:54,790
on the ionized Ohio Linux fest I am very
involved in the lesson of this chapter

279
00:40:54,790 --> 00:41:01,100
and this will be our second year old
higher if you would like to learn more

280
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,100
about these concepts

281
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:09,100
out of upstairs Ohio or only a hundred
and fifty bucks

282
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:17,330
hurling under this year really great
speakers last year eg from Nordstrom we

283
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,360
had a manager

284
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,460
folks came from all over the country

285
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:27,960
a bunch of Columbus locals with
technology with its strong security

286
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,980
physicians presented

287
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:46,660
organizers sponsors as stickers
restricts up trying to help yourself

288
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:51,140
always happy to chat or 60
