1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,230
ok everyone was gonna go ahead and get
started so thank you for coming there's

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,240
a lot of really familiar faces in the
room and I appreciate that I'm hoping

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,139
today's session is going to be
collaborative and not me doing all the

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,770
talking so those of you who are in the
back of the room if you want to come

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:24,029
forward that's great I promise I won't
like it on your lap or anything but if

6
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,160
you go to sit in the back I will call on
you so just know that too so the topic

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,340
today is about collaboration and this is
about cross-industry collaboration I

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,719
don't know about you but every time I
come to a conference like this

9
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,690
apart from being a bit of a sort of
family reunion it is also the time we

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,370
get together and we bitch and moan about
the same problems over and over and over

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,038
and over again

12
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,760
resonating it you had so many of the
same war stories yet this morning as you

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,019
talk to people in the whole wide gap so
one of the interesting part about

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,200
working at ohio State is sorry The Ohio
State University is that we put a fair

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,549
amount of emphasis on how well we can
collaborate with one another it's sort

16
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,040
of pot of this sort of the academic
environment to collaborate in my own

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,110
private sector life collaboration was
also known as meetings that provide a

18
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:33,000
lot of value right now is this
perception that that's not me now you

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,900
have got for it

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:42,520
see technical person no technical skills
that I didn't do that I do not know ok

21
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,090
I'm making the let us in so many ways at
Ohio State we'd like to try and

22
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,790
collaborate because there's a sense that
the mines you put against a problem the

23
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,250
more likelihood there is that you'll
actually solve that problem so when I

24
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,259
was asked to talk here at the at the
conference I thought I would talk about

25
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:07,570
collaboration as a way of solving some
of the problems that we all commonly

26
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,220
shared so what I'm hoping to get out of
today if I could make things work

27
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,920
is to find a reason not to have an
excuse so next year when you come back

28
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,510
to this conference you talking about
different problems and not the same ol

29
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,390
same ol so what we gonna do talk a
little bit about what I mean by what

30
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,420
cross-industry collaboration really is
going to talk about what are some of the

31
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,510
things that have in common

32
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,489
some of the things I do it and that the
participation part of today is one of

33
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,970
the problems that we all commonly have
that we need a solution to that we

34
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:46,140
should work together on solving that
problem and I don't have all the ideas

35
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,170
I'm going to throw up some balloons and
you can tell me thats a good idea or not

36
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,000
so what does cross-industry
collaboration look like in the security

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,400
will probably the best example of
cross-industry collaboration stops with

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:10,410
the ice axe but what I find with the ice
that is good but they tend to focus on

39
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,220
one industry at a time so in higher-end
we have rain I set the research and

40
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:24,130
education i SAT Medical Center has
something is in medical hospitals

41
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,209
ok retail

42
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:42,040
yeah financial does right

43
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,430
what's the what's the what what's good
about a nice set what do you get out of

44
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,840
it but the question for you that's not a
rhetorical let's go to bed and I stack

45
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,599
group therapy is always nice and
community to get group therapy what else

46
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,599
to get out of it

47
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,970
advanced knowledge of something that's
happening somewhere else in your sector

48
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:20,389
that you might know about forty not get
out of a nice that timely information

49
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:30,860
sometimes it's a bit slow what do you
mean by true collaboration not a whole

50
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,530
bunch of coordination yeah I tell you a
safe though to one of the challenges we

51
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,400
thought that is that you have to swear
on your mother's grave when you join the

52
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,270
ice at that you won't tell anybody
anything you learn in the outset and

53
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,310
then it makes it really difficult to
communicate that to the rest of your

54
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,030
organisation when there's something that
they need to know without violating you

55
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:58,530
know the promise you guys that would
result in child but they have to have a

56
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,919
purpose i would tell you I think they're
reacting like I classify sex is reactive

57
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,180
something's going on in the industry

58
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,070
somebody knows about it already and it's
a way of you finding out there's value

59
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:15,530
in that that is not particularly
proactive what else we think in the

60
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,700
network in the industry we are seeing
some of albendazole starting to get

61
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:26,599
together now and so individual issues
that those Bendis focus on as part of

62
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,260
their product offering yeah

63
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,760
so I'm so I googled this cause I was
actually sort of curious to see what

64
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,409
kinds of stuff might be going on so I'm
not prepared to tell you I'm an expert

65
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,150
on this particular issue but this
particular program you can see the

66
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:49,030
people heard his disco fire I tenable
romantic etcetera and i were really

67
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,979
looking at specific kinds of malware and
trying to get in front of specific kinds

68
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:59,460
of malware so they they what you would
imagine to be as competitive getting

69
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,880
together and trying to solve an
individual technology issue for anyone

70
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,250
involved in this here in the room now we
are seeing these kinds of things today

71
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,770
impressed with this it seems like some
of Al silos of coming down between

72
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,599
groups and we're starting to see some
work here I would also called this

73
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,350
proactive other than in this particular
case in the mail but still has to exist

74
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,200
in the environment it's not like they've
gone out and you know destroyed the

75
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,330
groups that are creating them out we're
in first place but it's more proactive

76
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:43,890
than the ice sex right they're really
trying to shut down a problem I have a

77
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,789
love-hate relationship with the federal
government and the military but I put

78
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,760
this up here as well when you look at
the research that's going on in security

79
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,349
there's a lot of work happening between
out three-letter agencies academic

80
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:04,350
institutions and private sector as well
so the next you know has a cyber center

81
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,660
of excellence he can ride the slide as
well as I can

82
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,860
we're starting to see a lot more of the
feds are waking up to the fact that they

83
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,600
can't do this by themselves and trying
their best to reach how certainly if

84
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,360
you're in academia you so too in the
crosshairs of famous tacos when you're

85
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,170
in higher-end you you live in brain
working with federal grants and so forth

86
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,950
but there are grants available to
private sector companies as well but you

87
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:35,770
might be thinking about taking advantage
of you haven't worked here already but

88
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,310
again mostly reacted at this point some
of its proactive

89
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:49,580
and because we're in Columbus I would be
remiss if I didn't talk about the

90
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,039
collaboratory who he works for a company
that's part of the collaboratory yeah

91
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:01,970
absolutely how's that working out for
you guys would get in the way of getting

92
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:07,980
this thing on cyber data led to write
this is a great cross industry

93
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:13,010
collaboration if you're already part of
a club right now there's a cost to be

94
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,230
part of the club and these companies
have paid it and so i'm looking forward

95
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,980
to seeing what comes out of it I think
it's fair to site still work in progress

96
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,600
but sort of sucks to be me if I wanted
to be part of it and I'm part of our

97
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:33,420
series I can't be right so how do you
take what these groups line and share

98
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,219
more broadly order we all you know
anybody else want to have the

99
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:43,080
collaboratory syrians often would then
maybe we'll set something up so there's

100
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,590
all kinds of collaboration that's going
on what are these things not doing for

101
00:08:48,590 --> 00:09:01,370
us as an industry not providing us
changing the overall landscape right

102
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,470
right so what I thought I'd want to talk
to you about today what other problems

103
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:16,040
that we collectively shit and its
collaboration a way for us to solve the

104
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,510
problems that we have so I'm gonna go
through a list of problems that I

105
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,770
thought up in about 30 seconds I'm
interested to know if you have other

106
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:31,689
problems that you would put on the board
and we can have a chat about things that

107
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:38,800
I see this thing so I mean talking to
you and talking to people about bees we

108
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,329
still don't have enough talent to anyone
who's police stopped with a fully

109
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:48,440
diverse organization got all the
resources you want no way to get them

110
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,240
when someone leaves for this yet but I
thought it

111
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,450
second I put security assessment results
as an industry and I'm not being

112
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:08,560
followed by a third-party assessment
presentation we have an obligation to

113
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,599
understand what else the body security
profile but it means that every single

114
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,310
one of us is going out and doing
security assessments of every single

115
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,540
company I've gotta be I'm tired of it or
not I've got to be tired of it right

116
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:32,430
big problem frankly big waste of money
collectively getting the boys to buy in

117
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,529
to Sauber I know there's another talk it
was a talk there will be a talk about

118
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:44,320
this that the recession is a problem we
all have even if you don't have a board

119
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,910
even if you're a part of a little
company that's just got a CEO and a dog

120
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:55,790
you've still got a boy by and problem
you know the dog just don't get it so we

121
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:01,569
gotta work on that and then lastly
building trusting contracts building

122
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:06,730
trust in our contracts is a problem that
we've got my thing so what can we do

123
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,610
about it

124
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,190
this is where I throw out some ideas you
might and might not agree with and in

125
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,140
some cases I don't throw out any ideas

126
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,160
talent acquisition I think groups like
this

127
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,630
Issa sands others we're starting the
scratches but we are all scratching

128
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,839
different pitches or to mangle the
analogy even further with scratching a

129
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,020
different part of the same which I think
we've got an opportunity to collaborate

130
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:39,100
as an industry and so for this let me
give you an example this morning cuz i

131
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,170
guess i cant get enough . mine boys I
was part of a panel and we were talking

132
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:49,189
about to be the city and stam to a bunch
of a child recruiters bhi recruiters

133
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:55,490
don't know what security is they don't
know what it means they don't know how

134
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:01,790
to hire for it they don't know where to
go to find recruits 224 they don't know

135
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,030
how to bridge people who want security
people into security

136
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:12,290
I don't know we should be telling them
as a collective voice what they should

137
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,819
be doing because they don't not they
should have not got hundreds of tech

138
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,380
jobs that they have to hire and probably
hundreds more non tech jobs as well so

139
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:26,860
what are we doing what are you doing in
your company your industry to help the

140
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,180
people who have actually go out and do
the recruiting for us to do a good job

141
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,739
we have an opportunity

142
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:45,260
internships are a big part of building a
pipeline we don't we

143
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,470
it's not that we have all these people
at the beginning of their career and

144
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,070
then they get to middle management I
leave we don't even have the pipeline

145
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:59,700
built up at the moment but what can we
do for internships this whole again

146
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,910
whole bunch of companies that are out
there that are working for internships

147
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:11,000
stands there again I C squared some of
the government agencies and so forth but

148
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,510
if you're a little company and you're
trying to build up a security team or

149
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:19,360
your you know one dude in a dog where
can you go because most of those

150
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,800
internships sort of assume that you've
got a big diverse organization and that

151
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,380
you've got a career path for those
interns when they comin how can we

152
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,060
collaborate together to say you know
what I'm gonna take those wanting to

153
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,760
bring them into my group and when they
done to hand them over to another

154
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,060
employer who's maybe doesn't stop but in
a different industry or does the same

155
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,530
stop it might be the next level up I
think we've got an opportunity to talk

156
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:49,329
amongst ourselves and and be more
strategic about how we can work on this

157
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,510
together

158
00:13:52,510 --> 00:14:01,780
if you're reading and materials about
public so applies to private boards they

159
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,770
are looking for people with
cybersecurity experience to serve on

160
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:13,079
those boards and in fact the SEC I think
the SEC has proposed public company

161
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,400
publicly traded company rules they
proposed that those boards include

162
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,459
somebody who has cybersecurity
experience on what are we doing as an

163
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:28,680
industry to identify security
professionals who have the competency

164
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,579
just sitting on a public void and how do
we get those nine in front of the people

165
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,310
who recruiting billboards cause I don't
know about you but I started from the

166
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:44,180
bottom up some very intelligent
technology savvy people on my board and

167
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,449
it's like an amoeba talking to a rock on
I'm not proposing to tell you whether

168
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:55,500
I'm able to rock right but there is
definitely a disconnect tryna talk about

169
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:01,110
the technical issues of rolling out a
security program with a board member so

170
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:06,630
we need to fund and final people who can
you can sit on boards and understand it

171
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:17,850
and then translate that to the other
board members yeah it is a problem for

172
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:25,380
guys or is this just my particular PTA
it's real

173
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,640
yeah so

174
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:37,710
we're starting to see the news before
price will pay will allow you to look at

175
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,160
their assessments

176
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,510
particularly other cloud vendors and
stuff like that because seeing these

177
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,319
kind of end is nothing on your door yet

178
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:51,000
little bit yeah and certainly if you're
if you're assessing a large company

179
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,790
they'll have been assigned 16 or
something like that but they'll probably

180
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:59,089
share with you you can take a look at
that I don't know about other any

181
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:05,660
external auditors in the room and want
to audit companies for living at a good

182
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,400
so here's what i would tell you about
that when you get your security people

183
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,370
to give up and they are being audited
what are the security people think about

184
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,370
the competency of the external auditors

185
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:27,820
friends you can say it and its spirit
right right out of school today

186
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,210
understand the context of the company
there auditing probably not so you going

187
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:38,820
to rely on the SSD 16 at the good solid
security assessment of a Venda is that

188
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:44,310
the only thing you gonna go yet got
myself an SSI 61 comment on it must be

189
00:16:44,310 --> 00:17:17,809
great place absolutely security
assessment is that

190
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:30,230
assessment control assessment what kind
of control of this as determined by that

191
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,389
management so you gonna take this
company and you're going to use them to

192
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:41,080
provide a medical appt to you or
something or some mechanical thing in

193
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:48,070
your operations department is that sSAE
16 gonna being tuned to the business

194
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:54,809
purpose but you'll need to be using that
bendable a likelihood that no so what

195
00:17:54,809 --> 00:18:01,330
has to happen you have to go out and do
your own assessment all over again how

196
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:10,320
many people have a standard assessment
for their vendors sides time but i think

197
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,899
is an industry we can go look is a
baseline data questions we're all gonna

198
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:23,449
off the first question everyone ought to
have a 16 seed companies could just like

199
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,480
published that on a website so if you
haven't done like me off what's the

200
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:34,460
second question do you have a security
policy right so there's all these

201
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,850
questions that is good security
professionals we're gonna go off I'm

202
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,549
going to ask every single day do the
same damn question five hundred times

203
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:47,619
and we never see how the for the first
four hundred and fifty times so we don't

204
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:50,918
know if the answer we're getting the
same answer the judge's down the street

205
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,820
or not there's no transparency in that
and it's costing output and it's costing

206
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:03,539
them hundreds of thousands of dollars
how we fix it as an industry is there a

207
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,759
solution to this

208
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,980
the barrier wait till the next session

209
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:18,700
hang out till the next session which
brings me to the last one contract trust

210
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,690
this

211
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:27,630
basis to this if I engage in a contract
with a vendor and I find a problem with

212
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:33,900
the Venda and I know that my Big Ten
school down the street uses really like

213
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:43,540
to be a hotel room when you wanna know
it's a liability see a problem with

214
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:50,750
lawyers for those are you in the box set
Holi Holi but in general I don't like

215
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,770
lawyers why

216
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,300
well because I think like law is they
don't think like risk manages and they

217
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,080
don't think like security people that's
a problem when you're risking security

218
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,290
trying to deal with your legal contract
boys who were riding contract to limit

219
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:13,240
liability that their primary purpose
really is to limit liability so nothing

220
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,050
gets written into the contract that says
look we're really a partner without

221
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:24,040
Venda and I have a risk for an issue or
mobility collectively it's in our best

222
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,170
interest to work to get it fixed yet but
instead they write a contract that says

223
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,920
if the vendor has a problem with a
contract with a vulnerability that

224
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,100
better damn well because before we find
out about it or reagan it to them for

225
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:47,270
breach of contract case I'm really good
at all for living so I think we have an

226
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:53,540
opportunity again is an industry to
educate illegal part about how to

227
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:59,230
interpret contracts so that we can
engage in partnerships we have it rather

228
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:04,440
than contract already assume that
they're out to get us and they're out to

229
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,910
take their piece about hard and we have
to think about that we also have to get

230
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:16,700
away in our contracts from putting in
non-disclosure agreements for things

231
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,700
that impact more than just us

232
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:27,870
thing I know that it sort of makes
people a little uncomfortable not having

233
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:34,020
an NBA but as an industry who are the
people that know the vulnerabilities are

234
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:40,639
existing in a company that bad people
I'm trying his gender nonspecific

235
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,800
language and sometimes it doesn't apply
the bad guys know where all the

236
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:51,320
vulnerabilities I he doesn't know where
the vulnerabilities out what's wrong

237
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:58,340
with this picture though so gotta think
about these industry problems and how we

238
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:09,490
can start to solve them so now I'd like
to hear from you know what you think

239
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:18,690
about us a solvable has anyone seen any
of those for whom he got that has anyone

240
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:36,520
salt for any of these or don't think any
of these are would go ahead right

241
00:23:16,380 --> 00:24:08,710
so I'm hearing heard that one is as an
industry we shouldn't expect people to

242
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,300
be a hundred percent ready to go when
they walk in the door we should be

243
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:17,930
setting expectations that there's going
to be a rain period and who we should be

244
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:26,650
looking at sympathetic industries or job
types that could bridge into security

245
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:32,480
cannot necessarily security people and
writing job descriptions and and job

246
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,700
offers accordingly

247
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:40,960
am i hearing that right develop your own
town who's got time to develop their own

248
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,980
town

249
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,760
hands

250
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:50,200
yeah you gotta make it yeah I i dont I'm
not disagreeing at all I think you're

251
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:57,370
right but how do we translate that into
something that's going to be useful for

252
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:03,840
our recruiting partners or our educators
in colleges if that's where you're going

253
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,659
to get your candidate's mom how to each
how do we know what we need to change

254
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,660
else so to make that happen

255
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:50,530
anyone hearing with academic
institutions to talk about curriculum

256
00:25:50,530 --> 00:26:45,379
yeah wow you want to talk about that was
probably the biggest challenge in that

257
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,440
area how many of you knew about a
program like this before you set the

258
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,410
room and we were discussing it right now
is a couple right so one of the

259
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:58,760
collaboration opportunities we have as a
security industry is finding ways to

260
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:05,350
share when we doing this kind of stuff
how is I S S I think as an organisation

261
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,840
could be really well placed actually to
be a a gathering places hey we're trying

262
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,290
as we don't know if it'll work or not
but we're trying we haven't got that yet

263
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,820
we've been competing with one another so
long but we're not yet

264
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,830
trusting each other to be able to share
that stuff even if it hasn't worked yet

265
00:27:23,830 --> 00:28:00,879
get ahead track right technology skills
coming out of a college degree right

266
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:32,700
they need requirements that they can
scale warrant roll through in a

267
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,620
mechanized wire right then I don't know
about you but i dont have recruited

268
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,290
sitting there this just you know going
through a hundred resumes at it I'm

269
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:46,680
better choices like one recruiting had
2,500 positions or something I had to

270
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,760
recruit for that and have time to go
through that kind of stuff so they got

271
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,430
an awesome thing how many years
experience you need well kinda

272
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,650
technologies are you looking for what
your education requirement so they can

273
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,620
plug into it

274
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:05,010
god help us and have the app spit out
the 50 so we gotta help them think about

275
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:10,110
one of those requirements that allows
them to do their job in style but still

276
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:14,429
cool the right kind of candidate sir and
it's a it's a tough balance to get it

277
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:52,480
so this just might opt for I think you
know when I talk to security people at

278
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,870
conferences they use things come up all
the time so maybe it's just me you have

279
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:03,139
others that you think are systemic
security issue

280
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:15,399
digital alanis user winners how do you
use your alanis

281
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:19,279
user awareness of how to be secure or
user awareness of the general security

282
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:59,639
environment so I don't disagree it's a
problem but I'm not sure that you're

283
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:02,299
characterizing the right way so I'm
going to challenge you a little bit you

284
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:06,899
guys can tell me you love it I don't
think it's that they don't know I think

285
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:13,559
it's that they don't care they thought I
don't know when you guys were getting up

286
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:17,980
getting ready to come here this morning
you're going for Ronald having a shower

287
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,590
or whatever are you worried that
somebody could be hacking into your bank

288
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:27,590
account at any given time would you care
about this if you went in the industry

289
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,850
so when I talk to them

290
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:35,709
the college students but I'm like hey
I'm hella and your friendly neighborhood

291
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,570
see so and I'm here to tell you about
all the scary thing that could be

292
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,899
happening to your student records don't
care we don't care we put it all on

293
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,000
Facebook we put it all on snapchat if I
lose my someone steal my credit card to

294
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,180
get a new one

295
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,380
banks don't care

296
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,560
hypothetical this isn't my own thing I
have ever team of people who are

297
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:19,440
computer science people largely
technology and I'm asking them to become

298
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,780
psychologists and social engineers do
you think as an industry we have an

299
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,250
opportunity to reach out to
psychologists and social engineers who

300
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:36,700
are not technologists and one from them
we is there anyone here who's not a

301
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,540
technologist who's talking about social
engineering at this conference

302
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,280
you see the point we're trying we're
trying to solve these common problems

303
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,360
ourselves not even ourselves as an
industry but ourselves as an individual

304
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,490
company or an individual unit in an
individual company and some of these

305
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,840
things a big Nali cultural things that
we're trying to adjust we can't do that

306
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,050
on air on so you're right I will put
that up there as number five but

307
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:10,600
probably actually number one on the list
were doing an awful job of it as a

308
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,860
security profession I would put it out
there

309
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,130
absolutely how to sell for

310
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:56,379
decide what we saw a bus driver
information security security risk

311
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:03,010
information risk I take security is it
part of just where maturing industry

312
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:09,120
that we haven't worked out yet right to
security security in that income that

313
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,120
covers all those other thing I ve got
hit

314
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:53,520
what I do what I do for my office to my
car and at three o'clock in the morning

315
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,620
I probably got my mice in my pocket and
what she when I'm walking as I go so the

316
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,049
issue isn't that we need people to
understand how to use the tools the

317
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:08,030
issue is we need them to have an
awareness of their environment and to

318
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:14,440
where appropriate change their behavior
as we need them to but again I got back

319
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,340
to technology security teams haven't
gotten skills to tonight that way with

320
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,040
West sourcing for the wrong kinds of
skills when you'll see if you're looking

321
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:29,009
for a technologist to run your security
program you'll probably still seeing

322
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:34,740
from the wrong place right now

323
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,770
technologists but I'm saying you need
more than a technologist you need

324
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:44,900
someone who can understand how people
think and how their behavior change you

325
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,920
know it's important to note that if you
tell people most people change the

326
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,680
password on a regular basis than
actually the psychology of it is most

327
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,700
people will change a password on on
about you he just complain that most

328
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,430
people don't change their password then
people go oh if everyone else is not

329
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:06,390
changing the password I want is a
psychologist to go to think about that I

330
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:51,580
know that we're almost out of time does
the question back here a little bit

331
00:38:51,580 --> 00:39:01,180
transferring risk is one of his second
to eliminating risk as a good risk

332
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,850
strategy right if you can eliminate the
risk

333
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:08,970
give it to somebody else we've allowed
people to transfer their risk to the

334
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:14,640
security team for too long not my
problem it's a security problem not my

335
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,460
problem I to use problems not my problem
but gotta wake up and realize it's a

336
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,820
business problem that may or may not
have a technology solution to it and as

337
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,930
a security team we need technologists
and psychologists and so forth to be

338
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:33,460
able to help them manage their risk so a
cyber insurance policy may have a place

339
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,990
to play the exception that doesn't
matter how much insurance you had you

340
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:42,299
assume reputational risk regardless of
whether or not you get refunded for it

341
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,430
so they can't truly trent uses cyber
policy to transfer their risk I don't

342
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,859
think I don't know

343
00:39:48,859 --> 00:40:17,308
bought from that I'm sure there's going
to be another topic about cyber

344
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:23,559
insurance somewhere in the schedule I
mean it's hot it's hot topic I don't

345
00:40:23,559 --> 00:41:07,609
think we've decided as an industry which
why we want to go yet so I'm with my

346
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:16,089
team will tell you we done mostly done
fifty with a 5-1 any final questions

347
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:19,089
before I wrap

348
00:43:48,450 --> 00:44:22,180
I think so the whole point of this talk
with to get the wheels turning with you

349
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:28,299
if you have interest in being part of
cross collaboration group that would

350
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:34,140
address any of these things I'm not
telling you there is going on that you

351
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:39,240
can plug into but I am interested with
people who are willing to innovate in

352
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,660
this phase and see what we can do so if
you're interested come and see me light

353
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,879
up and and we can chat and thank you for
spending time with me this afternoon and

354
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,890
enjoy the rest of the conference
