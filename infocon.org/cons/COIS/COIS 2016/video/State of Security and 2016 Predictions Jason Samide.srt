1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,420
while there might be able to retain
their security and 2016 predictions mine

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,480
increasing civilian director for
self-care located here looking at

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:27,029
including a little about me I'm 88
bought by my career fair city and the

4
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:34,320
last week when I'm very terrible public
speaking that's true I do to get better

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:46,030
and overcome that so bear with me so we
can talk about is a lot of realities and

6
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:53,140
silent ruled out this repeated salt and
actually succeed predictions if he has

7
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:59,670
any questions comments about it so I
don't stop is probably the things you

8
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:09,549
have RTC is worth mentioning a real
surprise is still very much they reason

9
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:19,790
why we haven't hit new records and its
is growing worse these criminals are

10
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:28,530
getting smart they're they're going
about doing it basically money is a lot

11
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,229
of their actions

12
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:38,610
corporate america is still the largest
what they're going after basically the

13
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:48,210
local brew right sequence capture her
school I is still an amazing 20 percent

14
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,210
followed by a 26%

15
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,100
know why

16
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:08,610
10 of it in a way where lower right but
it's don't know the answer that over

17
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:16,430
anyone answers that but it's a lot more
action are unknown at 10 Vale

18
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:35,340
untraceable becomes inconclusive so it's
a lot of difficulty or otherwise as a

19
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:47,120
phone now smartphones probably had in
the past so that I would expect for a

20
00:02:47,120 --> 00:03:05,320
little while recent news is that I don't
care anymore than the ones I hear most

21
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:43,238
often 78 @ so anybody have any other
ones so what these new threats that were

22
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:50,829
going to be seeing basically coming from
this area right here that's going to be

23
00:03:50,829 --> 00:04:06,720
fun for all the different tax base
increased that unknown factor so a lot

24
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,989
of people have it one of these little
with that needs talking in best practice

25
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:23,440
tonight the overall we all know thats
gonna be attacked when but if you get

26
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,389
raped by her intelligence

27
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:35,740
numbers continue to grow and grow this
year that's that's prepared for this

28
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:58,110
kind of weird just a little bit higher
but it's not so a lot of these solutions

29
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:08,139
are out there are not smaller sized
businesses recently becoming but they

30
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:12,570
tend to be bigger target up there as
well they have this much to lose

31
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:26,630
reactive focusing so much on defense
that were never in a spot to be

32
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,630
proactive

33
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:41,380
over I don't get my products have proved
that when they reached and then break

34
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:57,000
and it's very much a reactor world
because that created the tools that your

35
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Wednesday

36
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:35,830
States doing this and alarming rate in
there there should be effective that way

37
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:45,369
it's not the Prince of a grea they have
good techniques they actually had a vote

38
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:56,669
is a lot of cases while now and in some
cases we see the power be headed into

39
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:59,938
the unsubscribe so that's great

40
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:16,059
unsubscribe hyperbole so there are
becoming very efficient very smart he's

41
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:39,680
trying to do that and they were very
very hard to do because you just take it

42
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:55,499
one and a half so we would treat you at
a lot and it's basically backed by

43
00:07:55,499 --> 00:08:05,240
research some of these things that we
totally see if you're a dark place right

44
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,860
in forums

45
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,830
that's where we can present

46
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:18,099
have this breaking or some type of
actionable intelligence to provide to

47
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,190
consumers or businesses to say we're
seeing these rumblings of these

48
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:36,049
discussions or casual look at that this
is actual total this is real see the

49
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:50,329
correlation this latest so if we could
do that for me

50
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,910
corporates to him well for me industry
standpoint somehow

51
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:04,680
type of the evil scientist they do not
have an organization has been breached

52
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:14,910
based on the previous typically occurs
the FBI or some other agencies and then

53
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,810
that that's the problem

54
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:34,160
predicting the attack he created that
would be a key industry this is work

55
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:53,709
towards that proactive approach versus
reactionary you need some of this

56
00:09:53,710 --> 00:10:02,140
radical baby because industry just as
consumers are basically taking on the

57
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:11,439
chin every time a bank or video for his
asian gets compromised our interest

58
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,630
rates go up and try to reverse is great
but that costs have come from so it's

59
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,620
not going to be

60
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:28,760
her it's gonna be so if we were to
basically embraces industry could

61
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:44,480
potentially reduce these techniques that
are no no deadline would help prevent

62
00:10:44,480 --> 00:11:06,529
cyber breaches I forgot that were
treated so they've been around for quite

63
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:25,620
some time do they do that they were you
seen the news we have these but we're

64
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:42,230
still not reactionary look at dr this
one is a Porsche but again it's those

65
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:47,330
types of people that are out there so
house babies killing money to get that

66
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,790
these guys are becoming more and more

67
00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:14,100
Conrad but his agenda so history every
those who had died from fascist disease

68
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:21,589
so his theory was that it was jurors
knowingly

69
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:44,720
but its we as an industry to start to
raise our voices say this is what's

70
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,680
gonna happen right whether you are or
groups are managers leaders in the

71
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:58,000
industry to say these things so that
when it doesn't really matter told you

72
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:15,649
so but arab guy but he was very
effective use wire house the fact it was

73
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:26,240
crazy busy they let him enjoy the
silence is crazy now that it's a guy

74
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:34,529
genius of this time very now idea right
for whatever reason you're actually

75
00:13:34,529 --> 00:14:01,839
crazy and again that we're in that they
don't care

76
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:18,509
the reason is not prepared in 1999 that
will change change the car we see their

77
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:28,259
large very large regions hope they were
doing what features but we still need to

78
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:32,329
have these government agencies of the
government as a whole not really but i

79
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:37,540
think thats quite some time

80
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,840
or anything right

81
00:14:47,330 --> 00:15:05,950
frenzy trivia doesn't high-profile
computers this is going to be very

82
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:18,010
reactionary everything that we as a
species have to eat so some of our

83
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:31,740
predictions doxie is they're all there

84
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:58,680
find it again the mobile networks
increased significantly and I actually

85
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:07,270
had a city before this Apple in there
but you know is an encryption issue of

86
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:25,579
privacy issues so what's more important
is it to say I see the low friction

87
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:32,570
increase your privacy but for them to
unlock these phones for privacy person

88
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:52,690
for reason and watched a new series on
Syfy love you no matter what what little

89
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,850
tweaking duper

90
00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:13,179
somebody's reputation jobs or so people
are you leave this is this about

91
00:18:32,470 --> 00:19:39,590
they know it's a safe a dinner but it is
easy to break it down something that

92
00:19:39,590 --> 00:20:15,049
simple like that and also I think what
it looks like that and we're gonna work

93
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,870
right

94
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:22,399
driving is a very positive thing that
you do every day you look both ways

95
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:33,460
red light green light what was going to
happen when we had a population study so

96
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,450
not not say they were getting a dollar
for dollar

97
00:20:39,710 --> 00:21:41,610
well I mean that's that's all I'm going
to track that's right yeah this is why

98
00:21:41,610 --> 00:22:03,959
and why you shouldn't be right there
right technology and we're not allowed

99
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,510
to mess with it and with it

100
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:21,640
8000 you might get your contract or
espouse rely on speaking however the

101
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,899
office that revenue finding something
right

102
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:37,620
north or south I mean there's a patrol
all over the place where you a

103
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,389
self-driving vehicle

104
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:51,310
response accident overhead compartment
is so much money in responding Jackson

105
00:22:51,310 --> 00:23:05,270
that's what the municipalities rely on
that response jobs but there are parts

106
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:22,000
of the state but they want to meet at
stop sign right so that ripple effect

107
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,240
that whistleblowers

108
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:46,010
so as part of this my prediction my
prediction so that is why I asked voters

109
00:23:46,010 --> 00:24:01,670
back in the industry for their mind
their tradition because again so that

110
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:16,730
his dad and I actually said he had a
summit here are you ok and this hits in

111
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:29,240
these countries share that you know that
very few China Russia to forget what it

112
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,800
is the only did three minors

113
00:24:41,990 --> 00:25:03,760
so if you made a rather just played a
user access that theory elevated

114
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,760
privilege escalated privileges

115
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:37,990
else great powers that evolution that he
created his attackers figured out a

116
00:25:37,990 --> 00:26:25,580
different really so where her head but
so so now I don't need to do that when I

117
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:33,350
just got a user who may not be as i text
right so many of the building department

118
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,399
for me that I used around forever

119
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,699
bright and pretty pretty

120
00:26:47,400 --> 00:27:02,670
yes and no great question I think it's
there but it's because it's commonplace

121
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:18,270
with its same thing right right but it's
definitely a ride once they get a

122
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:40,570
victory lap because again we're still
not reactionary face certain medications

123
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:46,200
or sleepy reaction so

124
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:56,400
so that we need better directions I'm
tired of being always get the same level

125
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:26,670
as your piece by piece suit very sorry
about that I V curious why is it that

126
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:44,710
well I'm sure it does but that list is
from attacks I'm not that I dunno I

127
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:51,600
might run an organization here and I get
a lot of orders but but that just

128
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,530
servers from overseas or is that really
sucks

129
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,470
sure

130
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:10,830
more though
