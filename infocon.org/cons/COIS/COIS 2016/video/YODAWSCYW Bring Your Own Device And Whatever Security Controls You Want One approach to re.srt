1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:44,809
or do we just use the mouse wait to see
what I see when I started my name is

2
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:50,849
Stephen Kyle presenting my presentation
I'll get started here I do wanna I guess

3
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,399
maybe apologized after I wrote this I
realize the title is somewhat misleading

4
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,500
because this is the problem not the
solution

5
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,949
goal is to present the solution so that
you guys have some control our

6
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:06,210
environment is very unique we're
currently on a project and I'll get to

7
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,059
that later but because of the
proliferation of vendor devices BYOD and

8
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,080
other things we felt like we needed to
get get things arranged in a little bit

9
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,710
and that's where we started this and
that's what we're gonna talk about here

10
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:24,270
is how to move forward with it so let's
go ahead that first of all give you the

11
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,070
introduction of Columbus Ohio area
currently live south of growth lucky if

12
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,339
anybody's from this area again

13
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,710
boarding reindeer have been doing the
game for a while

14
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:41,380
started way back when I'm old and gray I
get that and was blessed to work for IVF

15
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,949
and the rest of the credentials are up
there

16
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,369
the bottom line is the best because in
August I have another grandchild coming

17
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,619
so they'll be number five very happy for
that but get the kind of give you an

18
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,619
idea what's going on

19
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:04,860
this is the one thing Chuck Norris
cannot be because everything you know

20
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,889
Chuck Norris there's limitations believe
it or not he's not god but I felt like

21
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,959
this is one of these companies one of
these waves that weekend no offense to

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,780
Chuck Norris fans I realized that that
Rep

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,310
preparing for this I did look up some
Chuck Norris jokes just kind of wake up

24
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,770
I know it's in the morning time so I've
got my top three for now and more later

25
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,070
so the first thing Chuck Norris wise we
have to keep in mind

26
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,940
Chuck Norris's website has never had a
hit because nobody will ever touch

27
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,230
anything belonging to church right
second one

28
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,640
Chuck Norris's keyboard doesn't have a
control key because nothing control stop

29
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,260
Norris right we got that and the last
one is if you ever look at his keyboard

30
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,320
are only only has two keys 10 everything
else is optional

31
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,120
things up and get things move it

32
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,600
BYOD is here you guys have all seen the
numbers potential saving rides a lot of

33
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,430
numbers I was doing when I was
researching this wasn't about the $350

34
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,600
per person per year as far as
productivity gains and that type of

35
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,810
thing so that's why I say even Chuck
can't stop it

36
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,330
businesses like it because they save
money on some cases they are letting

37
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,470
things reimbursing and other cases an
art project

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,980
people are showing up with stuff on the
door so how do we deal with that how do

39
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,109
we make sure that we have the
appropriate controls in place and

40
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,470
frankly the users like to users love
this stuff because if they want us down

41
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,590
here they wanna Panasonic if they want
an off-brand somewhere if they can find

42
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,100
something that fits that might help
their productivity that should be

43
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,590
encouraged some people care I myself
carrying iPad 2 meetings and other

44
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,620
people too so we have a proliferation of
phones tablets and phablets all the

45
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,709
different flavors thinks so it is a good
thing but there's gotta be a way to rein

46
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,709
it in so that we have some control and
some consistency

47
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,420
by way of introduction also

48
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,140
so at the project that I'm currently
working with him and see some wonderful

49
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,269
co-workers here we knew we had a problem
we were seeing the inconsistencies we

50
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,599
were seeing people bring things in you
know sometimes it would be a very nice

51
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,680
design sometimes not so I started
studying this I just recently got my

52
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,549
master's degree in December and
information security so I made the

53
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,880
support of my project how do we make
life better for our project but also

54
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,889
used in that respect so very proud of
the graduation Western Governors

55
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:35,650
University has their graduation at
disney world in wintertime so I

56
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,739
apologize for the crane exit castle they
were like family and they were taking

57
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,840
down the Christmas lights on if you ever
been to Disney World and bottom left is

58
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,989
my favorite dessert they have those dole
whips outside the Tiki Room they also

59
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,080
have a shout later they have been to
places of the Polynesian hotel the

60
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,880
exercise so that was one of the things
we did down there was enjoy the

61
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,010
graduation but let's get back to the
topic at hand I recommend the college

62
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,349
while if anybody has questions about
Western Governors getting online degree

63
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:13,729
program for us back to the subject we r
project and again I'm working on a

64
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:20,080
project primarily deals with medical
data moment and so when it was designed

65
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,050
and set up to him at the management made
the decision they were going to use BYOD

66
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,550
for everything so we have a lot of
vendors come in we have a very small

67
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,169
component up maybe half a dozen
employees arrested as a horse and so we

68
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:37,219
have a variety of contractors we have a
scale of one to 10 we have some

69
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,330
corporate issues machines where they
have very good controls very good

70
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,630
documentation and also very good
patching schedules and things like that

71
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,659
we have some that are were at a lower
level organizationally supplied

72
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:53,590
sometimes ok folks admin access local
admin access type of pics like that in

73
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,340
some cases then we have a lot of people
just showing up with what they bought

74
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,888
the night before or worse yet picking
something up out of the basement and

75
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:03,240
bringing it to work because they find
out on Tuesday I got a job and they have

76
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,860
to show up on Wednesday and they're
supposed to bring her own stuff and so

77
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,630
again we have the whole range when I
would call very good all the way down to

78
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,200
very bad

79
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,849
and that's one was driving our car
headache myself and Bobby might

80
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:21,070
September 30 compadre at the track here
and Caroline found out that we were

81
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,120
seeing a variety of things we had the
whole scale we have stuff that showing

82
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,840
up there hasn't been patched and six
months or a date operating systems we

83
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,390
finally killed all the windows xp
finally got that under control but you

84
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,390
know we're making sure we're doing it
and I get the problem was the vendors

85
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:41,080
are being hired by functional people
that they there was no security vetting

86
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,530
so they would come with whatever they
were had so the goal was to take the

87
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,320
project was to find some level of
minimum security controls we don't have

88
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,560
anything so you gotta have a baseline to
start from you don't know how bad it is

89
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,030
until you identify the problem right

90
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,090
what's that saying the first thing to
knowing you have yet to identify the

91
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,650
problem we can start to study it so hard
out west to study it and then we

92
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:10,090
realized as a result of that we had this
long acronym that I came up with a good

93
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,820
pronunciation for it but the essence of
it is bring your own device and whatever

94
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,409
security controls you want that's what
that acronym is for because that's what

95
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:24,220
essentially what we had some very good
somewhere very bad and we all know from

96
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,740
the security world hit only takes a few
bad ones to ruin it for the rest of the

97
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,570
world so that's where we were starting
from somewhere this was very

98
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,140
operationally defined because we know we
have a problem and so how do you bottom

99
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,770
line is on the bottom how do you define
controls when you don't you have no

100
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,490
access to admin rights people are just
showing up on your door every day

101
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,320
first thing we went through and again
ready has questions feel free I'm happy

102
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,510
to take the middle some of the rest we
quickly identified and these are not new

103
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,219
risks everybody understands these are
fair on the environment so we have a

104
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,980
shared wifi wired network that we use so
we only need one more on who hasn't

105
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,360
patch to suddenly let something in and
then start proliferating one of the

106
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,710
unintended benefits is because we have
so many different organizations in so

107
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,500
many different owners is we don't have
one master admin password for all the

108
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,470
machines because they belong to
different organizations so in one

109
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,060
respect because we do have a radio
vendors

110
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,600
applying people we don't have that one
single point of contact they may take

111
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,870
out you know this group with this group
of patients take out everybody but

112
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,880
nonetheless a lot of new stuff coming
nowadays it only takes one click to run

113
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,919
it especially in the social engineering
field we do have something controls

114
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,179
likeliest multi-factor before we get
into the back and stuff so you're not

115
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:47,579
gonna just blatantly login on our end
user population whether they be the

116
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,160
folks doing the work or the people long
accustomed to request their benefits

117
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,800
they're coming in through a web browser
so we have controls on those parameters

118
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,779
my concern and what we drove this from
what we do about these insiders have a

119
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:06,430
lot of functional people especially
testers and I love testers they have a

120
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,930
hard job but many times that's all they
know is what's in the box they don't

121
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,400
know anything about it

122
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,420
for instance last week when the guys
walked up and was having trouble with

123
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,790
his wife I went click and turn the
switch on 70th wifi worked homogeneous I

124
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,750
love that but you know that's what
happens with some of the biggest thing I

125
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,750
started looking at what we have an
insider and he's bringing in a virus

126
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,790
that he's not patch we're gonna have a
potential for heading out on our

127
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:37,430
internal network if we don't know that
it now their risk of course is that

128
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,180
something stolen high times the users
have a business need to download stuff

129
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,680
from our project and documentation
functional design documents technical

130
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,479
design document the rest their courses
if they put on the laptop this walkout

131
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,940
laptops to walk out the door i mean how
many people had to deal with laptops

132
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,310
disappearing over organization and never
coming back a few hints so those are out

133
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,709
there

134
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,530
and because we don't want healthcare
data primarily some of the examples are

135
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,930
running into what i've seen

136
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,310
quickly and one group in indiana gets
fined three quarters of a million

137
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,869
dollars because they didn't have
encryption on their laptops to help out

138
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,290
the Alaska Department of Health and
Human Services got a 1.7 million dollar

139
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,770
fine started out just what those stolen
USB Drive and then they started coming

140
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,600
into the organization looking around
realizing they had very low policies no

141
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,800
controls no procedures and that's what
drove that fine then so get Alaska

142
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,199
Department of Health and Human Services
had to pay that price and as recently as

143
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,960
last month

144
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:45,630
Oregon State University their health and
science department and lost a laptop

145
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,770
containing information on nato ICU
patients so get through another

146
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:56,280
situation so encryption for us is very
important and so if nothing else from

147
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,589
the standpoint not only protecting the
data but if the device is lost or stolen

148
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:05,530
so that was one of the risk that we have
and I'm just going to hit a few the last

149
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:10,589
one is anybody's read their history
about Mary Mallon she was going to marry

150
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,600
that the thing and put in there she was
a cook

151
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,320
live from 1869 to 1938 she ended up
infecting 51 people and three of them

152
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,470
died she was cooking would work in
people's homes and in the process of

153
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,970
cooking she was asymptomatic she never
had a single symptom but she was a

154
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,130
carrier but typhoid and so she would go
and she would start working on a family

155
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,700
within a week or two people would get
sick so we had this hidden care and

156
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,880
that's my example I used for this
particular one if we have somebody on

157
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,550
the inside our internal network and we
played a minute they've been breached or

158
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,829
they have some kind of mower going on
they could be in that situation where

159
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,480
they're spreading at risk are spreading
the virus in attacking us I looked in

160
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,500
the latest data breach investigations
report the 2016 one just came out from

161
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,690
rights and also got hacked by the way
and they listed three scenarios of this

162
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,710
same trend the first one being the what
they called the flea flicker which was

163
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,170
just basically more we're breaking into
machines another one was what they

164
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,300
called the alleycat started out with a
phishing email and then people were able

165
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,378
to get in

166
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:15,419
backdoor access to that spread through
the organization and then the last one

167
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:19,039
was what they call the imperfect
stranger again a road connection to the

168
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:24,919
network they all resulted in most cases
from the last one especially was a BYOD

169
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,959
machine from a contractor was brought
into an organization plugged in and

170
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:33,248
started spreading so that's against some
of the sample rest I would say probably

171
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:38,239
everybody has seen these same risks at
one time or another I knew we were just

172
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:41,609
trying to figure out how to categorize
and quickly so that we could figure out

173
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:46,249
a way to put to understand the problem
in and deal with the problem so we went

174
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:51,359
ahead and put that together have had a
very good group to bed all this through

175
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:56,119
so we came up with and we recognize we
have to start with something we are

176
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:59,479
starting at zero and I'm trying we're
trying to work our way up the stack so

177
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:03,949
this is going from level 02 level one we
intend to go higher as we get more

178
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,819
mature but we gotta start somewhere so
we defined a list of minimum security

179
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:12,358
controls in order to enforce it we had
to have a policy so we've been working

180
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:17,869
with the management team to get that in
place and then defining the jurors so

181
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:21,579
we're gonna make sure that we get from a
starting point let's go with the most

182
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:23,258
common devices so we do

183
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:29,119
enduro Apple and Windows you folks with
your palm pilots can wait till later or

184
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:32,769
if you folks have an Atari or a
Commodore 64 the older people might

185
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:36,720
remember those guys can wait until later
to let's get the let's get the mass

186
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,809
market first and then we heard about
what's the best way to start to get

187
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:45,189
reduced the rest from those things I've
identified plus more so

188
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:49,498
baseline twice we have to figure out how
to do it because we're dealing with the

189
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:54,029
health care industry we started with
what the recommendations so there's an

190
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:58,709
anemone in this series that's just
really good I like it and it's a good

191
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:03,319
trade mark but we also use the same
critical mass and CSC to critical

192
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:07,108
control list because that to me it's a
more operational because we're dealing

193
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:10,499
in some cases with the feds I don't like
this my like what we're doing with this

194
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:12,839
much better because they're very much

195
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,859
operationally are in it I was real
disappointed in the last series that

196
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:20,169
came out that they took away the quick
wins but if you read through pretty

197
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:22,520
quickly which ones are too quick wins
and which ones are now

198
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,170
I think they took them out because
people are only doing that quick wins

199
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:31,189
and that going deeper but they're still
there you just have to help the last

200
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,990
thing that was important was we have
vendors and our organization so we had

201
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,040
to consult with their security teams we
didn't want to be slamming stuff in her

202
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,000
they wouldn't supporter couldn't support
for real big on relationships and trust

203
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,080
and working with our folks to make sure
that they are able to understand why

204
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,150
we're doing things before we up on that
so we did interviews to understand what

205
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,140
are your controls what can we push and
what can we get and actually worked out

206
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:05,960
better than we did that we did some work
against you gotta deal with tax data you

207
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,790
want to make sure you have that covered
the regulations and pub 1075 a good tip

208
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,750
of course is well-documented especially
the high tech stuff and then we already

209
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:20,780
had policies and many place so we went
to that's just a brief list of the point

210
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:27,089
being BYOD is a conglomeration of things
and so this when I played a little bit

211
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,340
here this one applying a little bit here
this when applied to a bit here and we

212
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,960
last saw all those who put them into one
place and give you a coherent thing that

213
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,460
somebody can read one documentary series
of documents and I have to go to I think

214
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,680
I counted example here

215
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,189
13 or 11 different policies where that
actually had some overlap in this arena

216
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,650
so that but part of the driver behind
this as far as the research and coming

217
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:56,660
up with the list again I mentioned
earlier we don't own this it's not a

218
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,610
good thing it's a starting point

219
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,280
Microsoft Word document called their
microsoft Device strategy framework

220
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,780
this was part of what I did with
research for my permit great so they

221
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,010
have a four-step series starting out at
level 10 which is basically bring

222
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,970
something in it who cares all the way up
to where you know corporate issue

223
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,050
corporate controlled corporate
administered

224
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,069
so what we after defining through and
looking for that we realized we were at

225
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,450
level one let's move to the next level
and we can take a pause and as we tune

226
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,110
it get people involved then we can start
working her way up higher we will never

227
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,019
get to the point where a shooting
laptops I don't feel like management

228
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:40,220
would support it and I don't think they
want to bear the cost of that but what

229
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,519
we can do is get a foothold establish an
insert winking at making it tighter so

230
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,649
that everybody's coming from the same
playbook and I think that's probably the

231
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:52,310
best way we could do it the other team
recognizes people want flexibility so

232
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,589
that's where the bottom line we are more
of a standards-based approach at this

233
00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:01,779
point and I'll give you an example in a
minute so we have to find a list of 15

234
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:05,900
standards if you can demonstrate you
meet them have a purple shirt that's

235
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,970
great but I should hear my example here
is encryption and I just picked the for

236
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:19,150
devices that we were talking about
earlier Apple iPhones and iPads which we

237
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,130
of course after reading the press know
that maybe they're not as secure as we

238
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:27,929
thought using something called data
protection Android's use the typical and

239
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:34,210
write crypto unix script file for
poverty that Windows computers most of

240
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,620
them use about locker and some third
party and then Apple computers

241
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:43,928
themselves have file so the goal being
you can't we need encryption we there's

242
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,120
no two ways about it so if you're coming
to our project near walking in the door

243
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,639
can you demonstrate encryption and
doesn't meet our standards as far as

244
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,860
dealing that type of stop but odds are
it's going to be one of these four

245
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,709
layers of encryption same thing with
other tools and we'll talk about those

246
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,230
two depending on the type of device that
was involved and how it was actually

247
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,679
working any questions so far yes

248
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:21,810
were gonna get to that but I'll give it
two in a brief depending on the level so

249
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,090
we have individual contractors are
coming in her coming in straight off the

250
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:25,980
street

251
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,460
those guys know you're not getting into
a look have you come as part of our

252
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,960
onboarding process will take a look

253
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,280
people her recognized organizations that
demonstrate consistency in their

254
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,960
controls were going to allow them to
come in we figure at that point they've

255
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,940
got good responsible people and they can
demonstrate what the third their

256
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:58,090
sanitizing machines and stuff so it's a
hard date it has to be a hard date you

257
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,970
don't if you just kinda

258
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,390
validate don't trust quickly whereas
when I get out again

259
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:09,260
control that's not enforce is no control
people will understand that people say

260
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,000
yeah they'll do the check mark
compliance but they will never come back

261
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,410
and actually do it

262
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,820
good intentions are great but I also
understand the time pressure people are

263
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,820
under and how they are expected to
produce and to perform and its heart so

264
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:27,300
we did make it a hurry we made it a
discrete you when I get in until X so it

265
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,169
is fine so let's walk through the list
we're trying to make sure we knew what

266
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,690
it was and I can demonstrate some of
these little better case so first thing

267
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,690
is we gotta have your basics your mobile
games here

268
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,540
IMEI if you're playing an end to the
wifi to the other and I can supply

269
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,159
anybody with a list of these guys want
this case back to CSE number one and I

270
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,190
think 15

271
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,830
so you know what is that inventory
devices on the network that's just the

272
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,678
basics you'd be surprised that number
two would be necessary to actually tell

273
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:04,889
people but it does so you know again I
talked about XP we weren't finding as

274
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:08,469
much XP on the desktop as we were five
people finding people using it for a

275
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,000
virtual machine type situation where
they would fire because it's included in

276
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,389
many cases with free copy of XP know
that's an unsupported operates so we

277
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:23,519
have a look at the machines we also look
at they're trying to do something in the

278
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:30,809
back door catches patches are again he
and again we're doing a one-time look we

279
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:34,860
do reserve the right to come back later
to spot checks but 30 days to us seem

280
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,279
reasonable we don't want to push it too
fast and how many people have an order

281
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:44,710
iPad and just went through the debacle
Apple they issued the latest operating

282
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,879
system and it kept doing the spending
spending spending actually do it I know

283
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:53,658
papi ran into it and I specifically held
off so 30 days to us seem like a

284
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:59,769
reasonable point if not you know you
might be in the elements icon machine or

285
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:05,360
you may have some compelling reason but
at some point you have to true we we we

286
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,939
also not only the operating system but
how many people to applications that's

287
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,009
probably our biggest weakness in some
cases especially people who use flash

288
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:18,909
which I'm pretty sure is on its way out
I would want to be a stockholder for

289
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:24,710
Adobe anyway this again ties back in
critical security control eighty we got

290
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:29,120
a patch that's the cheapest easiest way
to fix things to be stable to make sure

291
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,000
that your that we're doing things you
asked a question I brought prices for

292
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
the people who asked questions

293
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:45,820
so here this is actually this is
something we gave our have to explain

294
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:52,129
but I'm happy to have you come so
there's RFC 2321 read other reliable

295
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:58,050
internet work troubleshooting agent that
we use as a motivational prize basically

296
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:03,930
a rubber chicken it is awesome in here
see instructions on how to use it is

297
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:08,410
mostly used to hit on the head with a
machine work you can smack it with your

298
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,540
rubber chicken so I brought a couple of
those to hand out to people if anybody

299
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:18,070
else wants a REIT reliable network
troubleshooting agent asked a question

300
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,960
and I'll give them out to my hand up and
once we ran out we run out a broader

301
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:30,760
view we also have a blunt or see so as a
Christmas gift but back to our control

302
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,620
patching is critical and it's the
cheapest insurance so the quicker we can

303
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,669
get people to patch the better off we
are but we're gonna make sure they do it

304
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:43,650
at both the applications based in
operating system doesn't do any good to

305
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:51,640
patch the OS if you still have a lot of
these are basics and I hate to covering

306
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,590
it with that type of a town I wanna come
off you know I realize people lot of

307
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,399
people debate the value of anti-virus
and anti-malware especially because of

308
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,730
the way signatures can change so quickly
I look at it for the really the diamond

309
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,830
stupid her more than anything else
there's always going to be some script

310
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:12,060
kiddie or something trying to take an
old exploit and diplomatic so it's not a

311
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,080
bad bank I don't see it as an end all
but at a reasonable thing to have out

312
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,220
there but we're only requiring a lot of
you notice some of these only apply

313
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:25,710
laptops some apply to multiple devices
again I tend to use Apple products I

314
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,070
like the walled garden I'm also not
enough to know that something can't

315
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,610
sleep in but again because we have to
start somewhere

316
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,380
let's start with what we can accomplish
in a reasonable fashion we're gonna go

317
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,680
with laptops an antivirus and
antimalware and again scanning to make

318
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,740
sure they're actually do it doesn't do
any good to have it if you don't use it

319
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,730
then jumping more onto the encryption
side we talked about that

320
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,900
storage must be encrypted we have a
policy about that already that defines

321
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,790
what it needs to be but we also wanted
to include the external devices it

322
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:00,200
doesn't do you any good to plug a USB
and we've gotten your desk and it

323
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,860
disappear it's not encrypted so
everything I don't need the hard drive

324
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,479
itself but also to the device itself any
external peripheral devices should be

325
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,090
updated numbers next one local firewall
again same thing it's just one of those

326
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:20,490
easy basic thanks it's not an end of
everything but the basic control and

327
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,500
then we did the password after hearing
the gentleman upstairs talk about spring

328
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:30,750
2006 he never really thought the best
control in the world but we gotta start

329
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:36,530
somewhere and I haven't you noticed when
I walked up to this laptop I just dump

330
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:45,600
it on but I'm not gonna plug any of my
stuff into it so I got another basic

331
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,600
critical control 16

332
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,630
screens how many people walk fine how
many of you I mean I tend to go over

333
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,870
into Windows now but I'm really tempted
get on email and send some love letters

334
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:05,199
to somebody but I resist that you
shouldn't let that they would like to do

335
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,790
the upside down 12 yes I know what
you're talking about here so that's a

336
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:14,440
good suggestion here you get a chicken
to have a very low bar

337
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:20,809
this is the last time it wasn't a
question or a comment but it went I have

338
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:30,570
one more or less than 10 timer yes it
drives me crazy so let's have a timer 15

339
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,720
minutes and that's too long in my mind
but again there are people who don't

340
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,470
like shorter time window so we had to
compromise on that one

341
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:44,169
number ten so basic I don't know what to
say if you want to use that at home

342
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:48,330
great if you an experiment I'm not here
to discourage innovation and I don't

343
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,389
want to do it I just don't want on my
network if you want to do it at home if

344
00:25:51,389 --> 00:25:55,090
you want to explore please do set up a
lab break stuff that's how we test

345
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,418
things when I think that's what the
gentleman was talking about earlier we

346
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:02,460
have to be passionate we have to
understand and find things but don't do

347
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,940
it on my network when you're supposed to
be doing something else you're supposed

348
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,609
to be working on pics you know let's
figure out a way we can isolate that but

349
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,840
if you're coming in at a special
exemption or good countermeasure not

350
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:19,759
jailbroken stuff that's just me pretty
good run again for the phones let's do

351
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:25,729
the device wipe away the FBI can't get
into it after they mess up and change

352
00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:30,859
the password on the storage but that's
another story is a you know we just pick

353
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:33,369
the Apple default that seemed to be
pretty good and the same thing with

354
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:38,749
number 12 all these heavy services let's
be able to find the stuff if you lose it

355
00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:43,029
if you leave it in the restroom or
something like that happens but you

356
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:48,039
still be surprised how many people don't
have it turned on this is also are also

357
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,820
including devices that plug into the
network that are personal phones and

358
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,989
those type of things if you want to use
it to download your corporate email then

359
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:57,989
you're gonna be subject to

360
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:14,510
we were that point taken up as a
security group and then say okay to find

361
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,590
the countermeasure in effect as you know
I get some flexibility in there so these

362
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:23,260
are not absolute they are used this and
and unless you run into an exception

363
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:28,690
exception if you're doing something that
makes perfect sense how many people have

364
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:32,870
seen this stuff and I've seen it to
where you get a thing that says you're

365
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,830
out of compliance could you went to the
more secure version as opposed to less

366
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:40,350
secure but because it's not in the
signature you get the warning that stuff

367
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:44,199
happens we recognize that plus we don't
want to discourage innovation the points

368
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,900
from our security team standpoint is
talk to us reflect Peter we want to help

369
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,570
you we recognize that we're in business
and I always take the view from a

370
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,389
security standpoint of work overhead we
can't help contribute to the business

371
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,600
and make things go better for not a
profit center and never will be so I

372
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,679
need we need to be cognizant of how can
we be an enabler of technology people

373
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,720
getting more productive or we can
deliver better value to the people who

374
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,960
are using our system so that's why we
set up the exception process how you

375
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,950
develop a good catch and they said
instructions are included it goes into

376
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,330
much more detail it works at all seven
layers of the OSI model so the guy did a

377
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:29,879
real good job writing the artsy it is an
actual RFC it's wonderful and I if you

378
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,840
look at if you actually read it it was
put out on April 1st so you understand

379
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,270
why it out there which is also coming up
very soon

380
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,880
again i cant looted the earlier not only
the device itself with peripheral

381
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,480
devices need to be on there again that's
critical security control this is gonna

382
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,550
be the hard line and I'm quite sure how
we're going to do this yet because a lot

383
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:59,490
of people have their kids are iPad and
that type of thing we're trying to do is

384
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:03,100
get people to just reserve a device for
work purposes only

385
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,560
you don't need to have your corporate
email on every single device you own a

386
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,120
tablet and this will give parents an
excuse to change the password and not

387
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,389
give it to you know leave daddy's iPad
alone at the bad people at security are

388
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,090
making me do this and they can blame us
for staff and that way we can be the bad

389
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:24,110
guy I'm so used to being the bad guy now
it doesn't matter but we do not want

390
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:28,760
corporate data and I realized the
tablets are the best example don't do it

391
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,830
for free gonna do it don't let your kids
play with it that type of thing that's

392
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:38,760
where the biggest risk and that's why we
get into the sharing so we don't want

393
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,420
people accessing corporate data were not
on have been gone through the disclosure

394
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,790
process not been trained on this purity
training have not gone through the other

395
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,850
things and I'm a country that to a
five-year-old I realize there's times

396
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,899
where the kids gonna be screaming and
you want to hand it to him

397
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:01,080
ok you know email and delete that
account it'll go up from there so this

398
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,860
is the list we kind of left it at
fifteen you can do a lot more but again

399
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,479
I do you get a foot or how do you get
started so this is the basic start up

400
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,970
problem that exists it's not a better
solution and their answer question but I

401
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,970
have a chicken for you

402
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,500
that's right now we're just gonna be
collecting the data so that we can

403
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,060
switch as we can see who's in and who's
doing what we have a later enhancement

404
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,960
that is going to actually get us into
the switches and then we can start doing

405
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,710
I wanna do Mac filter in I want to start
flocking into the MAC address before you

406
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,990
get it I can't do that yet all I can do
right now with the current

407
00:30:48,990 --> 00:31:00,500
implementation is control who gets to
pass work now we're gonna drive that way

408
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,700
but again I gotta get it started i've
got a project with like five hundred

409
00:31:03,700 --> 00:32:08,250
people have got five or six corporate
staff people like Frank Sinatra song

410
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:17,379
after work since so first phase now it's
gonna be made no later phases were

411
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:35,459
looking at doing anything tonight people
don't answer is yes

412
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,730
because there are particular one we are
starting to receive federal tax

413
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,970
information and to use as part of the
process of whether or not we're going to

414
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:51,389
be granted somebody as part of our
things medical stuff we takin come into

415
00:32:51,389 --> 00:32:56,779
account so are we going to be able to
use that if you're in the project we

416
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:00,860
have a you know you have the jump and we
have our multi-factor so if you're

417
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,500
getting on with your laptop that's why
it's on a tablet as you should not be

418
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,370
going in dealing with the federal tax
information while you're on one small

419
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:17,279
handheld devices so again part of its
IRS yeah we do receive data from the IRS

420
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:24,309
and act on it so yeah of course is the
federal tax we're just trying to keep

421
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:29,779
our requirements tight it really you
should meet you shouldn't get a lecture

422
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:33,679
appropriate to have a right roles and
right security I just don't wanna DBA

423
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,700
trying to tweak something from do it the
right way to try to do you should answer

424
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,830
your question

425
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:47,289
oh yeah this is unique to our project
that was probably the biggest thing that

426
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:53,480
why we did it and move on to their
status today we've reviewed and vetted

427
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,750
the control last frankly we have the
policies out there we haven't acted on

428
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,659
as far as I want to part of it is
because I graduated in December and I

429
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:07,350
took some time to relax you regenerate
and so now we're back to reorganize and

430
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:11,310
picking it back up I think I was just
having too much graduation after two

431
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,540
years in grad school and not see my
family not doing anything other than

432
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,569
studying it was a break we took a
potentially took a break so the other

433
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:23,849
thing I want to talk about a little bit
as we're implementing this and it's come

434
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:27,510
to light more than anything is we're
implementing this at the project level

435
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:32,679
it is very unique and specific unless
your organization using vendors

436
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,560
everywhere with a very small core staff
this really wouldn't work well at an

437
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,909
enterprise

438
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,809
so that's why we're taking it and doing
it at the project level week we know who

439
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:46,030
our people are we on boredom with that
and we're going to go ahead and just

440
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:51,429
started this is not a fix for everything
and in some respects it's unique to our

441
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:56,710
project because of the composition of it
but I think it will work well it where

442
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,480
it's appropriately sized and where you
have the similar situation but the

443
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,849
controls are still reasonable no matter
what you can take those adapter but as

444
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:08,089
far as our implementation plan we're
just gonna do it at our specific project

445
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:19,690
you are part of a larger enterprise yes
sir I would love to but I have no budget

446
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:25,799
so that's why we're starting with this
again future enhancement wise we'd like

447
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:29,160
to go down that road for that stuff I
gotta have something today that I can do

448
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,500
right away to at least get a good
baseline and then we would do when I do

449
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,789
more of a control control enforcement
type thing but we don't have the budget

450
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:40,510
for that right now so it's purely money
driven we were trying to find a way that

451
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:44,760
we could do it at low or no cost because
we had a problem it's do we wait until

452
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,220
we have a budget or do we wait or do we
try to act into something immediately

453
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,839
that will guide us toward getting better
as I said it's going from low level to

454
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:56,230
the next up will keep going with the
next step and once we demonstrate value

455
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:01,279
then hopefully we can get some
additional funding so that's why we're

456
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:07,890
in the particular status that we would
love to have more money

457
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:14,640
yes ma'am yes ma'am

458
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:22,940
one of the enterprise policies are
dealing with requires it to be us- based

459
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:29,859
so you don't have to be aware that type
of thing we're probably probably the

460
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:35,069
people we have I lean toward like
two-thirds of them are based are coming

461
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:39,920
to the project work we do have some
people who are not necessarily on there

462
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,039
but they usually come in through
multi-factor or through another networks

463
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:48,000
I will have to we're gonna get to them
later but most cases those are my people

464
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,329
with the better corporate controls the
ones who are just showing up on Tuesday

465
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:57,309
with a laptop they bought at Best Buy
the night before they went to work so we

466
00:36:57,309 --> 00:37:00,309
do we have some people out but not the
country

467
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:17,310
the way the project is structured as
with the five think we have six machines

468
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,710
are actually provided by the
organization and the rest of them were

469
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:26,140
all walking in the door so again

470
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:32,110
leadership chose this so we had to get
some things done how do you do this this

471
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,520
is just a lot of the general stuff that
people are ready to be aware of the time

472
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,790
schedule we were able to get leadership
in early we've already built some of the

473
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,670
job dates I want people to be able to
get to these quickly and not only that I

474
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,790
want them to take them and go home with
them if they can do some things on their

475
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,960
home machines that not necessary I work
12 against shredder and make it better

476
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,880
for everybody we're going to you we have
a checklist to find and so we have one

477
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,220
particular person Carlo who's gonna be
the onboarding person has two people

478
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,759
come in we're going to do it and then I
talked earlier question we have a

479
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,530
pre-approval process review the vendors
are going to trust you but we're also

480
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:15,450
not verify the antenna is a couple of
times oh you know weekly basis start by

481
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,509
checking two or three machines at a time
and keeping inventory thats we can roll

482
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:25,180
thru everybody the people hurt him so
again like everything else its

483
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,500
communication understanding what it is
it's getting in front of people early

484
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:35,480
and telling him what is so there's no
surprises I want with us because I

485
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,180
learned a lot through the process not
only about the controls that were

486
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,819
available but how to work better with
people so that's why I put this one

487
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:49,000
included this particular the first one's
pretty pretty generic most of our staff

488
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,590
and our project want to comply they just
don't know what to do and I have found

489
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:56,570
that I've gotten good cooperation for
most of them and that's probably a good

490
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,880
thing so that's why we're publishing the
guys were trying to push the guidance as

491
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,400
much as we can tell the people quickly
because I and most people have these

492
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,460
wonderful machines and they have no clue
what's already available so if we can

493
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,500
get him to use the features are included
are embedded were probably seventy

494
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,850
eighty percent of the way there
especially the people who are just buy

495
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,410
the machines a pic on the example of my
testers and they're great they have a

496
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:22,379
hard job to do 'cause are also trying to
be deadlines that many cases I still get

497
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:22,770
the

498
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:26,130
I dunno if you do that ur type of
response to things we show them

499
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:30,440
something so a lot of this is education
and I go with the assumption that most

500
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:36,430
Afghan comply and that's why I put that
on the bottom if we can lead we can lead

501
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,500
by example we can demonstrate within
help people we don't have to use the

502
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,640
Hammers much bob and I still use the
hammer or we have to but I'd rather not

503
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,819
I'd rather you comply voluntarily and
not have to do that it's it's in the

504
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,500
process of being upfront with you on
that I took too much time to play after

505
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,890
graduation but now it's getting there
it's been a great thing to all things

506
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:05,609
around and bottom line is on the last
slide bullet there I feel like we're

507
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,770
gonna be in a much better position when
we're done because we're securing our

508
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,740
end points that's one of the major
things as how many points you haven't

509
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,359
had that since I can block them in a
pretty good position so to summarize

510
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,960
cause we're almost out of time and I
have two more Chuck Norris jokes save

511
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,570
some businesses gonna do this whether we
like it or not that's why I repeated the

512
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:29,680
slide we gotta find ways to help the
business we need to find ways to make

513
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,930
sure that were part of the equation we
keep saying over and pushed away from

514
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,609
the table and find out about things
after the facts of the more we can bring

515
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:41,850
value to the organization the better off
we are so maybe when you hear my last

516
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:47,940
two Chuck Norris jokes okay sure so I
like I like these two I say these are

517
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:52,910
the Chuck Norris can read all encrypted
data has nothing to hide from Chuck

518
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:57,890
Norris right and of course he doesn't
need pseudo either he just types Chuck

519
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:01,770
Norris before all of his commands and
automatically gets nothing stops Chuck

520
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:06,340
Norris right speaking of pseudo I was
doing when I was looking this up I

521
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,360
thought it was cool there's a Columbus
connection to suit and I'll drop this

522
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:15,240
this is my last nerve tribute for you
when I was looking it up in 2003

523
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:20,250
Nationwide Mutual Insurance just across
the street contributed code to storage

524
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,270
to data and held up so Columbus actually
made suit

525
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:30,380
we can actually use you may know what to
do me understand what it stands for

526
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:37,630
yes maybe now it's super user do you
have a question or answer it

527
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:45,079
you actually know UNIX I'm proud of you
that's okay that's just the references

528
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:48,569
here in case anybody cares any questions
we have a few minutes and then we need

529
00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:53,660
to let you out of your next thing he
asked questions right why thank you for

530
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,868
coming I think you for your involvement
thank you
