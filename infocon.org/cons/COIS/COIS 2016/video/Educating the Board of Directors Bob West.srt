1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,250
last time managing director at work stac
technology consulting company and I

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,219
joined the circus security line of
business I also have the pleasure of

3
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:16,308
wearing another hat which is easier for
our parent company or Chris services and

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,750
would like to talk to you about today is
how to present to the board understand

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:32,028
what they're doing with that I don't
know where we're going we're good we're

6
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:39,670
going to find so there may be some
technical details but if you can see the

7
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,329
presentation you can hear me then I
think we're all good so what I'd like to

8
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:50,590
do for savalas help you understand what
the role of a board member is a look at

9
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:58,789
some historical issues look wet season
nirvana is like and take a look at what

10
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:02,430
our board members thinking how they
function what are the principles I think

11
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,820
one of the most important things in
security leadership is to help the board

12
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,580
members understand how they should be
doing their job and what questions they

13
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,310
should be asking so hopefully towards
the end of this will have some time for

14
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,640
Q&A and please feel free to interrupt me
as we're going along happy to answer

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,630
some questions in real-time one of the
things I'm going to reference is the

16
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,429
target breach which i think has been the
poster child of the decade but I think

17
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,700
there's actually some very good lessons
to be learned there so so as a starting

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,759
point I'm gone this crazy assumption
that you can read and apologize for all

19
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,829
be a bitch but at the end of the day one
of the responsibilities that board

20
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:51,008
members have to make sure that the right
controls are in place not just security

21
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:56,560
but general controls across the board
for financial controls strategy rose

22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,840
just really across the organization and
this is verbiage from a report called

23
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,910
wet the board of directors need to ask
the Institute of Internal Auditors so

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,470
one of the key things that you need to
understand is this is the council that

25
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:17,900
they're getting four major organizations
in this is pretty consistent you know

26
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,590
you'll see some similar things from the
National Association of corporate

27
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,880
directors as well but at the end of the
day the other key point on the slide is

28
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,510
that the directors shouldn't be
relegating the responsibility to

29
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,850
technology organization you know this
isn't technology problems right and what

30
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:40,640
happens if information is stolen whether
its strategy information customer

31
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,179
information there there's a lot of
reputational risks that could be present

32
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,900
you can have financial loss and you did
there there's at the end of the day

33
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:58,459
board members are held responsible so
they can go to jail if they're not

34
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,850
providing proper oversight and I think
you going back to target I think it's a

35
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:09,460
really interesting case study because
when you look at what happened going at

36
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,210
the highest levels there there's a group
called institutional shareholder

37
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,880
services an independent shareholder
group recommended that seven of the

38
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,209
board members not be re-elected because
they weren't providing proper oversight

39
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:27,290
is CEO has gone more than likely because
they were performing well in Canada but

40
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:33,640
I think this was a dual-purpose move CIO
is gone they didn't have a C so at the

41
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,738
time and and thankfully they hired Brad
Meyer reno is a very capable guy and

42
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:42,830
he's made significant strides in their
organization but the point being if I

43
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,180
were a public company board member I'd
be paying attention right and that

44
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,080
drives me to to ask some good questions
and some of the historical issues

45
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,130
looking at things on the security side
it's so weird as security report so a

46
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:03,930
lot of times senior security leaders see
says he s says have been buried in the

47
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,690
technology organization or they might
report CIO and one of the things that

48
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,030
you know there's a clear distinction
between the CIA's mission and the

49
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:20,000
season's mission said their CIO his ear
to deliver technology solutions to the

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,790
business the sea says mission is to keep
the environment

51
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,690
safe and you can get past that with
proper governance recommend you have to

52
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,080
have a good dialogue going going on
across the organization but all things

53
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,580
being equal there's a disconnect in
terms of reporting structure and you can

54
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,690
make it work though the security has
also been perceived as the business

55
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,500
prevention year and it's the guys and
gals and say no as opposed to partnering

56
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,400
with business and understanding you know
where you know what what types of

57
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,780
solutions can I bring to the table to to
get you there and one of the things that

58
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,760
I still here regularly is that you know
I don't have visibility with the border

59
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,099
the executive team and they don't
understand what I'm saying

60
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,660
and my response is number one they
shouldn't understand your language it's

61
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,530
your responsibility to put it into terms
that they understand right so how does

62
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:17,640
security impact might legal risk how
does that impact my regulatory posture

63
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,520
how does it impact my top or bottom line
and those are the types of conversations

64
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,780
that you need to be happy and then
historically also you have this black

65
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,140
magic thing you know pay no attention to
the man behind the curtain all is good

66
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,560
and security without being transparent
and one of the things that most people

67
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,680
need to understand that are in that
position is when you take a look at an

68
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,790
organization across the board they're
pretty clear metrics in terms of how an

69
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:49,070
organization functions there they're
working well or not so you have clarity

70
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,210
around how CFO functions how general
counsel functions

71
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,200
business here are they make money or not
at the meeting their their captives and

72
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,969
I think final thing that I still here
although not as much as I used to have

73
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,990
had a couple of conversations in the
last six months we're a couple seasons

74
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,600
of told me that you know one of their
responsibilities as to prevent breaches

75
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,940
from happening and I i think a bit
similar to think of a general counsel

76
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,570
going into a board meeting or an
executive committee meeting saying they

77
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,610
can prevent lawsuits from happening
right probably not a whole lot of

78
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,480
credibility after that statement is made
and I think there is a really strong

79
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,990
analogy there

80
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:36,560
r so so flip side is it foresees has to
do their job well they need to

81
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,740
communicate business value that they
need to understand that one of the

82
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,260
things most important to the business is
is managing their brand and reputation

83
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,940
so I think of going back to the target
breach their a bit over a hundred

84
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,300
million consumer credit card records
that were stolen

85
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:01,930
for example Chase had to reissue two
million cards and they had no control of

86
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,800
the situation right they were victims of
the situation but it's a real a real

87
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,420
impact to them and I personally know
three people whose checking accounts

88
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,610
were drained because of the target
reached they got their money back but

89
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,110
but it's a pain in the posterior and you
know that JPMorgan Chase is general

90
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,800
counsel was on the phone with her tits
general counsel you know let's have a

91
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,340
little chat right and you think of the
fallout going since that point sometime

92
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,140
in the last six months there was
clearance that a class action lawsuit

93
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,240
from the banks was allowed to go forward
you know there was a billion dollar

94
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,690
lawsuit in Canada and they will settle
for a billion it'll end up being less

95
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,200
than that but there's financial cost
there's reputational cost not just for

96
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:51,130
target for anyone that's in the
ecosystem so so again going back to how

97
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,570
does security get translated into
business value right I mean how can I

98
00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:01,650
deliver better products more securely so
for example both in our parent company

99
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,929
and with companies that that i've
consulted tour we're we're consulting

100
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,260
with a lot of times particularly to be
to be a group that they'll be proposals

101
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,409
that are being responded to an and
consistently some of the questions that

102
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,960
are being asked as how are you
protecting information right and if you

103
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,280
can tell a good story that says you know
I'm I'm doing a reasonable job then

104
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,909
chances are that you're going to get
additional business so I I think of it

105
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,890
if you're familiar with manufacturing
and ISO 9000 if you're buying a product

106
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,799
from someone that's 9001 certified it
means they have read controls in place

107
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,740
there's predictable quality and you're
probably going to get a good product so

108
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,089
if I'm considering buying a product in
some way

109
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:48,249
one company is ISO 9001 certified the
other one isn't prices the same that's a

110
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:55,149
pretty easy decision to make and so
using ISO 27001 701 as a reference model

111
00:08:55,149 --> 00:09:01,779
underpaying something that that's a
significant cyber security framework I

112
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:06,100
think the P that the CSIR should
function a lot like a general counsel

113
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,709
and if you think of what a general
counsels responsibility is it to coach

114
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:16,498
the business on what legal risk exists
and what's reasonable tix but but the

115
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:20,569
general counsel never accept the risk
for the organization it's the line of

116
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:25,099
business and in a similar contacts and
see so should be doing the same thing

117
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,509
and particularly as it relates to the
board the season should be coaching

118
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:33,290
board in terms of what's what's
meaningful and what makes sense to

119
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:39,439
accept in terms of risk it going going
back to metrics when you start talking

120
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:43,769
to the board about metrics they and the
executive team for that matter they

121
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:47,709
don't care about you know how many
viruses that you're you're blocking

122
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:52,699
right I mean how many attacks you stop
the general conversation is our are you

123
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:56,050
doing what's reasonable you know what's
commercially reasonable and I'll get

124
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:02,290
into that a little bit more and finally
on this slide just taking a

125
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,759
comprehensive approach to making sure
that you protect information

126
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,129
consistently across an organization
that's really one of the biggest

127
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:15,620
challenges is doing its technically but
you know the good news is if you use a

128
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,339
consistent approach like nest or ISO as
a reference model and you execute

129
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,100
against that then chances are you're
going to get there more often than not

130
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:31,540
so when you start talking about no
wonder what are the guiding principles

131
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,790
for the board as it relates to oversight
over how information is protected within

132
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:42,459
their organizations so they need to
understand that there's an

133
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:47,550
enterprise-wide approach that's taken
and most organizations have enterprise

134
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,630
risk management organizations

135
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,070
and in general they do a good job in
terms of understanding

136
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:58,050
economic risk financial risk
geopolitical risk credit risk but in

137
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:04,209
most organizations technology risk isn't
part of that equation and so getting a

138
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,870
perspective that says you this is one of
the things that allows us to manage risk

139
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,350
across the enterprise is not only
something that allows you to do it

140
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,970
consistently but its language that the
board is going to understand the

141
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,650
directors also need to understand here
so what are the legal implications of

142
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:27,090
protecting information properly or not
you know going back to target you know

143
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,960
it's talking about the number of legal
actions that are taken against targets

144
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:38,830
oh and there can be multiple right so in
the United States just just allowing

145
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:45,670
there is i think there's 50 state
security breach laws that exist now and

146
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,780
there's been national laws have been
under consideration for some time but

147
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,530
given the political climate I would
expect not to get there in the near term

148
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:57,410
but that's one of the things that from
from a legal perspective you know what

149
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,949
do i do and as an organization you know
what I preach happens and bottom line is

150
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:08,880
you need to be prepared if the boards
need to have consistent access to

151
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,050
someone that really understands the
cybersecurity world it can be someone

152
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,189
within the organization it can be
someone externally but at the end of the

153
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:21,520
day they need to understand you know so
what are the right questions to ask as a

154
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,520
board member and how can I understand if
the organization is doing the right

155
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,140
things you know they they they need to
understand that the executive team is

156
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,920
taking an enterprise-wide approach to
protecting information and that the

157
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,640
right budget is there and the right
staffing levels there so going back to

158
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,830
so what are the questions that the board
is going to be asking you know at the

159
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,880
end of the day if you're communicating
with them properly and they understand

160
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,000
what you're saying they understand
problems you're dealing with that then

161
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,590
they'll get it and you'll probably get
the right level of funding

162
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:07,910
and staff to do your job properly and
and and the final bullet on here is what

163
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,829
once they really understand the state of
affairs that will be presented with you

164
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,810
know so what are the burning issues of
the day what do I need to dress as an

165
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,780
organization and then they can make some
decisions in terms of yeah this is

166
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,680
something that needs to be addressed or
I may transfer risk insurance there are

167
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,250
multiple ways to address risk in an
organization but really understanding so

168
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:33,390
what are the top issues that I need to
be addressing is fundamental to the

169
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:39,800
Institute of Internal Auditors has six
questions they pose two board members

170
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,699
that they should be asking their
organizations so the first one as does

171
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,400
the organization use a security
framework so he's mentioning I say this

172
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,720
cybersecurity framework is also another
one bottom line is pick one you use

173
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,500
something that's comprehensive and you
know the good news is whether it's i SAT

174
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,840
there tends to be a good mapping in
either direction what I see is that most

175
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,340
companies that operate internationally
will tend to use ISO because there's a

176
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,870
certain number of countries that have
the perception you know if it was built

177
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,830
in the United States evil maybe not
necessarily to that extreme so this

178
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:28,090
comes out a bit and it's actually quite
reasonable but but I so is done in a

179
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:34,180
relatively neutral way it's it has
international participation so you know

180
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,790
one of the important messages it needs
to be sent to the board is that it

181
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,709
breaches are going to happen right i
mean you can't prevent them are you can

182
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,280
minimize the damage if you have the
right visibility and the rate controls

183
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,689
in place but when that happens you know
sooner or later you're going to go to

184
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,300
court and when you go to court if you
can say that I have a consistent

185
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,699
approach is commercially reasonable it's
an internationally accepted standard

186
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,220
than the settlement and the amount of
litigation that goes on is going to go

187
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,460
down and then obviously there's some
industry specific requirements that you

188
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,310
happen to me there's

189
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:15,920
there there's hip antitrust health care
that PCI if you have financial

190
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,380
transactions credit card transactions
that occur you there's there's specific

191
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,900
ones all of its generally maps back to
ISO

192
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:30,540
there are some industry-specific ISO
frameworks bet but ISO 27000 as

193
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,579
comprehensive across the board and it
starts at governments goes down to

194
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,440
policies and you have to do this crazy
thing and tell people about that policy

195
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:45,860
at the end of the day at soup to nuts
rich so the next question that that the

196
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,089
Institute of Internal Auditors poses for
board members that they should be asking

197
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:53,630
you know what are the top risks the
organizations have as it relates to

198
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,529
cybersecurity and right now we're going
through this fundamental transformation

199
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:03,960
from a technology perspective so they're
most organizations have either gone to

200
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,010
the cloud are in the process of going
there to bring your own disaster and

201
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:14,130
bring-your-own-device phenomenon that
goes along and and that the basic notion

202
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:19,580
as most organizations either thank you
note so here is my network right inside

203
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:25,140
is good outside his bat and the reality
is that hasn't been relevant for 15

204
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:30,170
years for sure so so you need to be
looking at things in terms of you know

205
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:35,459
what are my assets right i mean what's
the value my house and then you need to

206
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,430
understand where they sit and then make
some decisions in terms of how I protect

207
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,170
them that whether it's within your
infrastructure the cloud or on devices

208
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,219
you have to have a strategic approach to
protecting information

209
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,390
outsourcing has been part of doing
business for quite some time you know

210
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:56,780
whether its traditional outsourcing
offshore outsourcing and whether you

211
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,510
outsource or not it doesn't matter
you're still responsible for protecting

212
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:06,109
your client information and strategic
information it doesn't absolve you about

213
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:12,409
that responsibility and you also have to
understand that natural disasters will

214
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,569
happen I remember back in 2008 when the
latest round of hurricanes were hitting

215
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,460
New Orleans and

216
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:26,770
the South Ohio sent a lot of Electrical
Workers electric sector workers to be

217
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,410
prepared to address the the the
hurricane it landed and what no one

218
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:36,420
understood was that the winds from
hurricane gonna hit midwest so we had

219
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:43,470
sustained winds of seventy miles an hour
I think it was over 48 hour period and

220
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:49,980
and Ohio had outages up to about 10 days
and it was gradually contained but I

221
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,680
remember there were several Fortune 500
companies in Ohio that were simply shut

222
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,900
down they didn't have business
continuity plans in place and as a

223
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,900
consequence

224
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:09,999
as a consequence of drilling is
happening speaking of interesting well

225
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:12,999
we're just gonna have to deal with this

226
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:19,840
so speaking of unplanned events so you
need to plan for things like that or or

227
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,500
disasters or or cutting of electrical
power or whatever happens to be we're

228
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:32,070
just gonna tap dance and see where you
need to be prepared how often are you

229
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,159
looking at

230
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,200
access reviews so who has access to what
and when they get and what did they have

231
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:46,660
access to a stop it you're not listening
to me so so then it's even better very

232
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:52,430
eager dentists so so then you have
advanced persistent threats and I think

233
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,340
this is one thing that most
organizations don't pay attention to say

234
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,310
you have things like china is a nation
state that had that has had a really

235
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,870
persistent effort in terms of stealing
intellectual property over the last

236
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,850
fifteen twenty years so what does it
mean to me if my customer list its own

237
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,189
right

238
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,060
my intellectual properties stolen how
does that impact me as a business and

239
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:21,580
that's the conversation or certainly one
of the conversations that our our

240
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,830
employees and business partners made
aware of what they need to be doing on a

241
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:30,899
day-to-day basis for protecting
information and a similar to taking a

242
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,090
strategic approach to protecting
information in this is something that

243
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:39,939
the cascades down from the board set the
board thinks this is a priority and

244
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,560
executive team is going to be a priority
sector etcetera etcetera and one of the

245
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:53,520
companies that I worked in we had a
challenge and gonna make a long when it

246
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,379
went here so one of the things that we
did is so so many people cannot wear

247
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,750
their access badges and display them
which was corporate policy and we we

248
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,920
played a little game for anywhere in
this week and it was hot the executive

249
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,880
that isn't wearing their their badge and
ultimately whoever challenge the

250
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,500
executive got $100 things like it was
carrying $100 that people didn't catch

251
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:24,130
on early but i think is by day to
someone finally challenged the executive

252
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,370
and and and and after that people really
understood hey you know I need to

253
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:33,459
challenge my organization because I may
or may not know everyone that that comes

254
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,200
in and out of my building but but the
point being is that you need to

255
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,090
challenge an organization and go up the
food chain and make sure that they

256
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:46,570
understand it's important so you know
for example if the CEO decides that I'm

257
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,520
not going to wear my badge his or her
direct reports are going to pay

258
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:56,250
attention that the CEO doesn't wear
their bad but why should I right or if

259
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,750
they don't remember their passwords or
whatever the behavior is it's it's a 10

260
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,980
at the top

261
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:08,870
mentality you then you have all these
positions that have significant impact

262
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,300
on protecting information so you have
application developers for example you

263
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:18,100
have project managers are people that
are managing infrastructure there

264
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,490
there's some very focused awareness and
education that needs to happen to make

265
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:28,390
sure that they're protecting information
and I think just even focusing on

266
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,870
developers for a second most people when
they go through college they never

267
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,870
taught how to code securely and so what
happens if you as an organization don't

268
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:43,330
take responsibility and educate them
they start writing code and and in most

269
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,760
cases it's going to have a lot of
security vulnerabilities and it's not

270
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,790
their fault it's just they haven't been
taught so it's a part of it is if you

271
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:58,500
can reduce the number of application
security risks it goes really long way

272
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,750
and integrating that to the development
lifecycle whether its traditional SDLC

273
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:09,200
delivered a box become something that
brings a lot of value to the

274
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,740
organization so the board is going to
care about things like so so what are

275
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,970
the threats that I'm exposed to as an
organization there again going back to

276
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,980
the model of insiders good outside as
bad a lot of organizations that don't

277
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:30,090
pay attention to insider threats so when
you think of things historically you

278
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,639
know such on how to Trader wasn't 2007

279
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:39,859
that lost seven billion dollars of their
money because he was a rogue trader and

280
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:47,949
what happened was joined in a role that
was in compliance moved into research to

281
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:54,809
trading and along the way pertain the
access to all the system that he had all

282
00:22:54,809 --> 00:23:00,379
through his jury can and if they had
understood that I needed to control and

283
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,978
take away outlets from his previous
positions a lot of the damage would have

284
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:11,440
been eliminated or if there had been
some limits in terms of you know I can

285
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,339
make a trade that goes to this level but
once it's this large then I need to have

286
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:22,418
someone else about a trade makes sense
there there's a tape that things that as

287
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:29,039
see such as security organizations can
be impacted in a very positive way but

288
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,639
at the end of the day you really need to
be asking that question as a board

289
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:35,289
members so you know what are the risks
for the organization what's the

290
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:39,539
likelihood of bad things happening and
and the things that are most likely are

291
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:46,539
the things that I want to address it one
of the foundational things within

292
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:52,408
security organizations as having the
proper governance and and again I think

293
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:56,629
this is one of the common mistakes I
think most see says still don't

294
00:23:56,629 --> 00:24:01,218
appreciate that managing relationships
and making sure that there's an

295
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:06,119
enterprise-wide conversation going on
that that's going to solve a whole bunch

296
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,439
of different issues on a day-to-day
basis and getting validation that my

297
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,499
strategic approach at a fundamental
level lines of business and technology

298
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:21,629
strategy so so you have this dynamic in
many cases where the security group is

299
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:28,839
meeting with the network for the
developers right if you have a strategic

300
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,839
direction set for the organization and
everyone at the right level of the

301
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:39,269
executive team agrees on a particular
direction that those conversations can

302
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:45,109
be addressed much more easily so if you
define you know what my policies are

303
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,250
right for example if undeveloped

304
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:53,090
I should only be developing a
development environment and then move

305
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,090
things test and then into production

306
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,290
there there's a lot of organizations and
I still see that will be development and

307
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,680
production for example but it's probably
not a good practice so at any rate if

308
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,070
you've agreed as an organization that
that's the rate security hygiene follow

309
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:14,010
and there's proper governance through
the organization you know if there's a

310
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,020
disagreement then you can just funnel it
up through the organization and yeah

311
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,110
because it's one thing to listen to Bob
at sea so right that's another thing to

312
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,729
listen to your boss and generally
speaking you're going to listen to your

313
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:31,780
boss more so if you have the right
governance and everyone at the top

314
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,409
the greens that you're going to do
development in a development environment

315
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,580
then you just find all of the
conversations through the organization

316
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:46,689
ultimately the message comes back down
here is how life should be right and you

317
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:50,450
have this broadside of the issues that
you need to be addressing as an

318
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,940
organization anyway right i mean you
have a fundamental business issues and I

319
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,230
I like to use examples so let's say
there's a new business initiative there

320
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,370
there's a chance to make an additional
hundred million dollars in revenue but

321
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:10,110
there's there's a risk of losing one
million as a business leader I would

322
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,899
choose providing that I'm not impacting
the rest of the organization I would

323
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:20,520
choose to accept the risk and leaves
$10,000,000 the probability of having an

324
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,270
additional hundred million dollars in
revenues higher and a number one thats a

325
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:30,840
business decision and you as a see so
where is a senior security executive me

326
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,510
to be their coaching business to
understand well if you're heading down

327
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:38,440
this path here's the way that we can
minimize the risk of losing ten million

328
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,730
dollars in the packing rest of the
organization that makes sense

329
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:51,710
so as I was saying it breaches are going
to happen it's not a question of if it's

330
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,450
a question of why so how how prepared I
am I so the question is there is a

331
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:02,700
breach has prepared a robust response
costs are having basic incident response

332
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,280
plans in place and doing that's crazy
thing about testing them to make sure

333
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,530
that when things go bump in the night
you're properly prepared to one of the

334
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:17,040
the really important things to do is
make sure that the communications group

335
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,500
is engaged because more than likely
prices going to come out asking so what

336
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:27,390
happened and if you don't have clear
concise answer that's communicated to

337
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,950
the outside world it can really impact
how you're perceived as an organization

338
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:37,350
rights he thinks Sony example in their
multiple breaches probably didn't handle

339
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:42,840
it very well and you have to have a
crisis management team in a very clear

340
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,639
way to get to the executive team and
ultimately to the board if necessary so

341
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,360
couple times I've developed instant
response plans for the organizations

342
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:59,399
that I plaid or for my clients a lot of
times you really need to understand so

343
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,590
what are the systemic escalation
prophecies that exist in your

344
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:08,360
organization because what you don't want
to do is you don't want to that one off

345
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,820
process and you want to align yourself
with with things that already exist in

346
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:17,470
the organization so one of those
decisions that we made and one of my

347
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:23,730
former stomping grounds that when
security issues arose rather than the

348
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,960
CIA's organization leading the way

349
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,470
flip to security and non-security would
make decisions in consultation with the

350
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:35,610
business in terms of what decisions were
made along the way to resolve the

351
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:40,379
security issue but at the end of the day
having some very clear roles and

352
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,670
responsibilities so who who's coming to
the table you know when do I need to

353
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,060
engage law enforcement

354
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:53,260
clear that the plan better and and if
it's rehearsed whether you're doing

355
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,710
tabletop exercises in the same holds
true in terms of business continuity and

356
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,740
disaster recovery

357
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:05,179
as well so so hopefully that's helpful
as I was saying that Institute of

358
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:08,880
Internal Auditors has some good
materials that you can reference you can

359
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,170
go on the National Association of
corporate directors website they have

360
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:17,190
some good information and one of the
publications which I've referenced ever

361
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,500
last 10 years or so

362
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,240
information security governance kinds
reports of directors and management is

363
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,010
published by the Information Technology
IT governance Institute but I think

364
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,059
still exists part about Saka

365
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:34,570
there is a really good references think
I think at the end of the day if I were

366
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:39,309
to leave you with something you know
that this is a journey and you know the

367
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:43,480
good news is when you get the board's
attention you're starting a conversation

368
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,790
and and then from that point forward you
need to make sure that you continue to

369
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:53,570
engage them so on the front and when you
have your first conversation with the

370
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:58,149
board a lot of times you have to do some
education right i mean this security 101

371
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:03,510
here's what we're doing as an
organization to protect the organization

372
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,860
and here's our plan

373
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,600
happy very clear in terms of
communicating yeah so here is our gaps

374
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,939
but here's what I'm doing to fill the
gaps and if you have a good strategy to

375
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,260
address that and that's going to be well
received as having a conversation

376
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:23,090
earlier and you don't want to over
promise to been writing you need to be

377
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,480
grounded in reality when you're
communicating with court because if you

378
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,240
say you know all is well and it's not
you know sooner or later these people

379
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,340
aren't stupid right you know that they
will find out at some point and if

380
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,840
you're not being transparent in terms of
what you're doing well and what you're

381
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,689
not doing well then that becomes a
problem in at the end of the day they're

382
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,130
they're there to help you write a mean
they're there to partner with you to

383
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:53,480
make sure that things get done and I can
tell you about you know what I i've

384
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,320
leverage my boards and an internal audit
to get things done in case I view them

385
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,389
as partners yeah we're on common mission
right to make sure the right controls

386
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:06,800
are in place for organizations so the
key thing is really understanding that

387
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,350
leverage that relationship to make sure
that I get to the end

388
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:17,999
happy to answer any questions that you
might have questions comments

389
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:40,350
yes I think that the composition of the
board makes a really big difference have

390
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:47,959
a good friend of mine workers so that
she's Comcast she's on CMS energy so so

391
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,710
to their credit they really understand
that having someone that has expertise

392
00:31:51,710 --> 00:32:00,840
in cyber security is the value on being
a full member board member died I think

393
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,549
particularly given the climate that were
on your having someone as a full member

394
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:09,309
of the Board makes a lot of sense and
worse case having access to someone that

395
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:14,019
has deep expertise and can help the
board understand you know what are the

396
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:17,999
issues of the day what do we need to be
concerned with makes sense

397
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,380
yes question was going beyond using a
framework to protect things

398
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,900
comprehensively what else can you do to
show that you're you're doing things I

399
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,150
think that's what your question is
what's commercially reasonable so I

400
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,820
think one of the things that's why it's
one thing to understand that you have a

401
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,870
good passing it on a regular basis you
should be bringing someone into validate

402
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,770
that what you're doing

403
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:06,770
makes sense that a lot of times you may
just not have visibility into what's

404
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:10,710
happening in Terry's of an organization
whether its network infrastructure sure

405
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,860
whether its development physical
controls every buildings and having an

406
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,070
objective opinion from the outside
periodically

407
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,470
is going to give you some validation
that what you're doing makes a mean I

408
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:27,290
can always have my opinion but I am
doing the right thing and it might be

409
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:33,850
but but there may be issues in terms of
execution and I just think having having

410
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:40,110
a regular conversation to validate that
makes sense yes

411
00:33:51,820 --> 00:34:03,300
so I think your question was how do you
communicate you know when when

412
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,970
vulnerabilities occur across the
organization do I think I think one of

413
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,630
the things you really need to understand
you know so what is the vulnerability

414
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:18,240
you know what's its impact in my
organization and and then you can make a

415
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,169
decision in terms of what you
communicate a part of it ends up here

416
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:26,070
did do you have the right process
existing to communicate so it but severe

417
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,830
enough to have a good incident response
plan to live at access to the right

418
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:34,710
people that can help solve the problem
you know if I'm if it's happening at an

419
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:39,220
outsourced environment for example you
have the right contacts so I can pick up

420
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:43,819
the phone shoot an email up and have a
problem with drops a lot of it really

421
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:49,580
becomes judgment in terms that this
could be a show-stopper four straight or

422
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,279
it could be something liar so so first
of all is using your own judgment and

423
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,330
having a measuring stick to understand
is it a really high risk that I need to

424
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:01,710
address right now or is it just annoyed
that I can get to you later hope will

425
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:23,520
answer your question yeah yeah yeah

426
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:42,720
capture what you said I think a lot of
times there's an expectation that it's a

427
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,549
technology issues gonna be handled by by
the security and technology keeps right

428
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:52,910
as opposed to being a business issue so
I fundamentally having the rank

429
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,060
governance in the rain

430
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,410
enterprise conversation going on to
begin with is a starting point in

431
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,399
addressing because if we agree on the
rules of the road

432
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:08,279
number one and you know when people
should be engaged address an issue that

433
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:14,910
solves a lot of problems and and having
great sponsors so for example in my

434
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:20,109
particular case I have an active
dialogue with the CEO my parent company

435
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:24,550
general counsel so number one protecting
information is important that man it's

436
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,490
important to them

437
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,620
a because it's a hostile environment but
it's also important to the board I mean

438
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:35,350
they're getting questions on a regular
basis so so get getting back to so what

439
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:39,420
do you communicate to the board the
board doesn't want to understand why I

440
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:47,650
had some noise today they won't
understand significant issues so if

441
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:51,750
there's something really significant
that is going to make the process that

442
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,690
you feel like making process in the
board probably needs to know you have to

443
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:06,710
have a process in place to get the board
that help any more questions while be

444
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,089
here

445
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:11,880
rest of the day so please feel free to
catch me in the hall I think there's

446
