1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,430
hopefully will but by the end of this
and please be interactive you and ask

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,008
questions

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,710
proper hand by the end of this hopefully
will be able to give you a little bit

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,190
information to go back to your
organizations and if you're looking at a

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,570
cloud solution be able to ask the right
questions

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,570
get rid of some of the fun that's out
there and talk to your your your

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:25,330
enterprise executive team your board of
directors about what what you need to to

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,909
get a good cloud solution so the
question is why all the misunderstanding

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,550
cloud inherently end and David Smith I
think had a great quote here he said

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,750
it's all about the capabilities
delivered as a service with a clear

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,870
boundary between the provider and the
customer and that makes it very very

12
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:50,959
open to the Miss think about the
airplane industry I mean if you're going

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,260
to build an airplane here can be very
concerned with the parts that go into

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,570
the engine you can be very concerned
with how that's maintained on a daily

15
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,239
basis the operations of it how it flies
right as a consumer in the airline

16
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,130
industry you really don't care about
that you care about getting from point A

17
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,350
to point B with free drinks and some
wifi right that's really what we want we

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,259
need wifi has to work or that really
sucks the reality is you're gonna do

19
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,570
some due diligence of course right you
can read the paper your papers your

20
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,880
gonna say you're gonna look into whether
united as flying on time with American

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,960
Airlines has had an accident and you're
going to go to a different provider if

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,829
you're not satisfied with what you're
seeing but ultimately at the end of the

23
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:32,548
day

24
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,890
point A to point B that's your SLA so
let's talk about some of the missed the

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,229
first Miss and I love this one so full
disclosure on who I am I'm strategist in

26
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,799
the office of the sea so at the scalar
we are a cloud play pure cloud built for

27
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,909
the club multi-time security provider

28
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,430
when I go to corporations and I talked
to them and I here we don't really use

29
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:01,390
the cloud everybody uses the card
somewhere marketing anybody in here from

30
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,790
marketing good marketing is responsible
for this we have slapped the word cloud

31
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,160
on

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,140
absolutely everything we have private
cloud public cloud hybrid cloud you can

33
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,070
have an on-premise cloud not sure how
that one works if anybody knows please

34
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,120
let me know it's ridiculous the reality
is shadow I T another marketing term

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,310
this is what I call simply a
well-informed employee that's what

36
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,280
shadow ideas if you've got HTTP or HTTPS
open to the internet and they have a

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,290
credit card you chat you've got cloud
services running somewhere in your in

38
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:41,170
your environment and what we need to
look at is why are they doing that

39
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,980
because please don't come to the office
every day going going to violate policy

40
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,829
and get fired today what they're trying
to do so trying to do something better

41
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,640
for themselves or their team or their
the company right there trying to find a

42
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,739
way to maybe work on the train while the
commute so they want to throw stuff up

43
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,040
in the box Dropbox you might have an
engineer who's checking code in to get

44
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,350
home so he can get home check it out and
work on it at home right it's not

45
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,720
malicious intent

46
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,340
the majority of this enum malicious
intent it is simple desire to operate

47
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,750
under what we have today and the
employees to come in today are coming in

48
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,500
early version Facebook Google all the
cloud apps that are out there and they

49
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,270
actually have a better scope it tools as
they come into organizations than we

50
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,959
have in enterprise we are slow about so
is a see so you want to be able to get

51
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,280
away from saying no you don't want to be
the Yes No Department you need to be the

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,980
yes and here's how and be able to meet
manage and monitor so it's actually

53
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,630
really interesting following the last
gentleman who's talking about privacy

54
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,260
and very specifically around monitoring
because you know we we don't want to use

55
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,239
the term surveillance it is but you want
to understand what is happening on your

56
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,600
network you want to be able to go to a
cloud provider shoes one whether it's

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,769
Dropbox or box you pick between the two
of them you decide what works he buy in

58
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,959
bulk for your corporation you put in a
cell in place and then you have an

59
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,670
acceptable use of a cloud solution and
it's not your day of scattered

60
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,070
everywhere across the whole bunch of
different solutions the key is to

61
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,070
understand what is happening in your
network

62
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,990
myth number two I lose control of my
data when it goes to the cloud relates

63
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,200
directly to miss number one you lose
control of your data when your employees

64
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,280
are using the cloud and you don't know
about the location where the platform

65
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,200
that you put your data on should not
affect your control if it does if you

66
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,479
have a cloud provider that affects your
control

67
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,180
believe that cloud provider find one
that does it properly there should be no

68
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,160
reason that the fact that data has gone
to a different place we did this through

69
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,340
the eighties and nineties with IBM EDS
and all the others we outsource RIT

70
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,090
department's data went out it's very
much the same stuff take the word cloud

71
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,700
of it certainly makes a lot more sense
you want to make sure that you have data

72
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,670
portability data portability is critical

73
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,780
you need to make sure that you get your
data back out because we live and die as

74
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,460
cloud vendors we live and die by our
service right so you should have the

75
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,169
ability to pull your data out and go
somewhere else or pull your data out and

76
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,910
use it somewhere else maybe you want to
put it in the Splunk you wanna put it

77
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,380
into a sim you wanna put it into some
big analytics projects but it's your

78
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,520
data you need to retain control of it
and that comes as you develop your

79
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,789
relationship with your cloud provider as
you do your due diligence throughout it

80
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,200
number three

81
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,870
cloud is less secure than on premise so
if anybody was anybody here for the last

82
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,560
last talked

83
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,670
couple ok so we mentioned a couple of
these inhuman couple these in here every

84
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,150
one of these logos up here has suffered
a reasonably major breach in the last 24

85
00:05:53,150 --> 00:06:00,190
months and every one of those breaches
was on the reality is cloud providers

86
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,990
again are back

87
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:07,370
RRR are operating based on their their
reputation and what they do for the

88
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,150
application they deliver so if you're
talking RAM scraping now where that hit

89
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,529
target or

90
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:22,499
michael's whether it was stolen admin
credentials that were used in JP Morgan

91
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:28,039
and OPM or even now what we're seeing
more so trusted third parties right the

92
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,419
trusted third-party IBM ThinkCentre out
there is trusted third parties but also

93
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:37,909
in the case of target it was 550
mechanical HVAC vendor but that's how

94
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:42,019
they got in through a trusted third
party they had access to compromise

95
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:46,679
fazio and the great part the the reason
that they would target something like a

96
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:49,378
father to us because when you target
fazio now you have all their customers

97
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:55,269
you don't just have one scene with OPM
opium it was key point background

98
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:58,259
checking company they were they were
part of the process for doing the

99
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,139
background checks just found out I think
it was last month that not only did they

100
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,139
get all the PII all the background of
five and a half million sets of

101
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:13,319
fingerprints I mean mind-blowingly
insane how deep they got into that right

102
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:21,119
but that's because on any one of these
is not a security provider rate target

103
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,349
is a retailer

104
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:26,529
Changs as a restaurant they are not
going to invest in the security programs

105
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:31,969
that a cloud provider has to write we
have to the whole reason we did cloud is

106
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:34,110
cheaper

107
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,249
disagree with that one its economies of
scale right so a cloud provider is going

108
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:44,159
to invest should investment that's not
to say they're not going to and if they

109
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,549
don't that's where the due diligence has
to come that's where you as a consumer

110
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:51,558
have to ask those questions you want to
see what their security programs are

111
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:56,279
where the investigation and what makes
it more secure at the end of the day it

112
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,269
needs to be as secure as your
environment or better that's what you

113
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:06,009
want to aim for when you're talking to
the number for I'm at the mercy of the

114
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:13,349
cloud vendors for patching yes you are
but is it mercy or just the

115
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:18,539
responsibility we all how many here had
to go through some sort of effort for

116
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,568
heart bleed when it came out right how
many people are scrambling

117
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,919
trying to find the patch task right
that's what you have to do you still

118
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,799
gotta wait until a vendor comes out and
build a patch and submits it sends it to

119
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,478
you then you gotta take it bring it in
test it roll it out to all the things

120
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:43,409
for your vendor hostile right this is
laborious work it's time-consuming and

121
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,800
costly and that's what they cloud vendor
does because that is their business

122
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:55,689
it had better be their business missed
back in 2014 decided all of the standard

123
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:01,519
SSL Certificates we're gonna be 2048 bit
SSL certs right that implemented a

124
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,079
four-times load on networks that
implemented extra load on decryption

125
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,640
equipment on the web gateways if you're
running your own stuff that's all stuff

126
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,540
that you a probably didn't plan for be
have to account for him pay for rent and

127
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,050
then had to implement or your SL a state
of 59 so the cloud provider and it's his

128
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,439
problem which it should be and that's
where you're going to look at the

129
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,310
benefits oh yeah absolutely at the mercy
of the vendors yes it is their problem

130
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,579
it is their issue they need to deal with
it you need a good contract contract

131
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:39,260
stipulates always right and this type of
thing doesn't affect you

132
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:52,540
appliances provide greater control over
scalability and performance I know the

133
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,079
cloud is the last great just that's one
of the benefits so that whole concept of

134
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:04,680
multi-tenancy we squeeze everything out
of every CPU every network device every

135
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,370
piece of hardware that we can because
that's how we make money we get the most

136
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,000
out of it and in that way we've got a
greater profit margin when you scale on

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,820
Prem

138
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,270
the difference you're going to have to
deal with this you're gonna have to deal

139
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:25,680
with the purchase and you gonna have to
deal with planning for peak usage right

140
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,699
not consumption you've got an
organization with 10,000 people in it

141
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:37,890
and you go to a cloud provider you will
buy 10,000 licenses right goes with it

142
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:42,040
if you're building your own
infrastructure for that you're going to

143
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,530
have to plan for the peak capacity of
10,000 users taking a jar system

144
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:54,420
performance reviews 9872 of them are
gonna do it on Friday before it's due

145
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,130
that's what we always do right it's
always at the end or it's a retailer

146
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,590
that has piqued Christmas either way
you're going to have to plan for that

147
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,530
the rest of the year of the rest of the
week of the rest of the month that stuff

148
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,430
is running at 40% 50% 60% whatever it is
it's not running at the peak it's

149
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,839
running at a much lower consumption and
then perhaps you decide you're gonna do

150
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,030
an acquisition so you're ten thousand
users gonna buy a company acquired them

151
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:26,240
they've got 2200 more so how do you buy
more capacity by in the trunk that they

152
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,880
sell it and so do they sell in 10,000
user chunks or do they sell it you know

153
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,770
the appliances are scaled for X type of
performance and you having to buy it now

154
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,199
and then if you want to change your
buying multiples and if it's a multiple

155
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,970
locations you're buying redundancy and
now you're actually looking at will do I

156
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,250
have to read architect be corruption to
have to reread and it's all the pieces

157
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:50,560
so does it give you greater control over
scalability performance you know it

158
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,859
gives you greater responsibility over
planning capacity you need to make sure

159
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,870
again when you're dealing with your
cloud providers they have the ability to

160
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,300
scale you need to ask them you need to
validate can they go through it don't

161
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,079
run a load test on a cloud provider it's
pointless what you want to do you wanna

162
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,770
talk to one of the customers as your
size or bigger and say what was it like

163
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,920
when you on board it was the first week
like was the first 30 days like what

164
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,199
were the first six months right now
where you can find out how did they

165
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,660
bring

166
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,750
today bring them on with very little and
try to jam them in a building they go or

167
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,190
did they actually how much capacity as
they brought them on and it wasn't easy

168
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,190
smooth on board

169
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:42,930
assessed and I prefer interactive but a
cloud security is more difficult to

170
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:48,989
manage again this know this comes from
people that don't use cloud right this

171
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,370
when you when you I would argue it's
actually the exact opposite truthfully

172
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,339
when you have to divide managed devices
you're going to manage multiple devices

173
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:02,160
typically in multiple locations being
managed by multiple people gonna take

174
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,000
that data somehow pull it back so let's
go in the security around that's that's

175
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,740
where I'm sitting so you've got a bunch
of devices that are out there you gonna

176
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,410
pull them back when you've got a sim you
got against plunk something we want to

177
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,949
make sense of it you wanna correlate
again something else that's your

178
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:19,819
responsibility to follow us back and
make sure that all of your

179
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:24,670
configurations are getting pushed out
correctly again data portability comes

180
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,389
in here so this is this is coming back
to one of the earlier miss in that you

181
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:32,339
need to make sure that this does not
become a silo

182
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:37,060
you want to make sure that as you work
with your club cloud provider and again

183
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,518
will stalk security that you can get the
data out of them bring it back maybe you

184
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,610
wanna correlated against local firewall
logs maybe you have an on premise in

185
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,790
maybe you have a different vendor that's
handling something for you but the data

186
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,740
needs to be yours and you need to have
portability with it plus if the vendor

187
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:59,430
doesn't do a good job you walk away
that's the idea that's the controlled

188
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,000
you have is that your only at the behest
of that contract one year two years

189
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,120
three years maybe not a 58 year
investment into a hardware and

190
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,110
infrastructure that in this day and age
if you're planning anything that's a

191
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,019
tote

192
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,079
gonna be we don't know what's going to
happen next week let alone next year so

193
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:21,430
you want to make sure that you have that
type capability adding new capabilities

194
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:27,469
as well so if you decide that you're
managing your security and contrary to

195
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,220
what the previous case said

196
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,009
to do some surveillance and you're going
to crack SSL right I do advocate and

197
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:41,199
sort of a side note the privacy aspect
is very important we should not take

198
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,500
anything in the security realm
especially when it comes to decryption

199
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,040
lately whether its iPhones or SSL
decryption it needs to be done in a plan

200
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,379
and thoughtful manner

201
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:56,410
having said that it needs to be done
that's the issue right now from a

202
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,660
corporate perspective we on the security
side see well over 50% of all advanced

203
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,110
persistent threats now coming through
SSL I guess figured it out

204
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,899
encrypted we don't look at encrypted
traffic it gets through its a very

205
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:15,569
simple way in and you know take a look
at the the hospital NDC the just shut

206
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:20,490
down on monday right for Milwaukee
they're using proprietary encryption

207
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,399
it's rather interesting exploits did not
going there but they're using

208
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,269
proprietary encryption to get in and out
of the network so back to this if you

209
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:35,980
want to add a module you want to add
capability when I had SSL decryption

210
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:42,319
the on prime world that's more boxes
more management with your vendor it

211
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:45,449
should be a configuration change that's
what it should be

212
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:50,879
if you want to add sandboxing again if
you're going to try and go up against

213
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:57,259
something like lucky that things mutates
every day every exploit we've seen 75

214
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:00,720
different versions of it in the last
month alone that we've blocked against

215
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,589
and that's what's happening the only way
to find out is to sandbox you have to

216
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,709
detonate it yet to run it you gotta see
what it does make sure you get your not

217
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:12,399
gonna get a signature race best you
could do there is maybe let them

218
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,339
infected and what it calls out
command-and-control tries to get the

219
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,949
keys that you block it there but that's
still a clean up you have to do into

220
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:22,609
risky way to do it but it should be a
configuration change that should not be

221
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,040
a tree architecture more boxes H a
bidding war accepte

222
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:42,230
cloud resources are more exposed to
attack the days of the network I only

223
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,690
application I'm gonna lock it down I'm
gonna control who's on it to make sure

224
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,210
they have to be on the land using to
factor it doesn't work anymore if it

225
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,040
doesn't it doesn't

226
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:59,760
unless you are you know DoD and you're
pushing everything through 100% BPA end

227
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,369
with no BYOD this becomes a problem
trying to lock it down your employees

228
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:09,040
are gonna want access right this number
one right now we don't use cloud

229
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,700
services are gonna want to access your
gonna open up web services can open up a

230
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,830
web application expose the day that way
you can create a VPN that's typically

231
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:21,250
what we see and police are going to
complain because if your back holding

232
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:26,020
everything back to corporate all traffic
that VPN the experience is slow they

233
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,410
want to browse Facebook while they're
doing their H R report whatever it is

234
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:34,660
and then you end up split tunneling
right we see a majority of users a bill

235
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,660
to be split tunnel now you got a back
door into the environment and a nice

236
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:45,020
pipe out to the internet so the reality
with cloud vendors is we have one

237
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,450
methodology that we are going to open up
to our event to our customers and that's

238
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,360
going to show you get in and out we're
going to protect that as best as we can

239
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,219
write and again you're going back and
you're looking at what does this cloud

240
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,110
vendor do what are their capabilities
you gonna ask those questions but there

241
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:06,979
I can guarantee you will be investing a
lot more in the security program that

242
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,810
they have in place to protect them
application that they're selling to you

243
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,000
then you will be in your security
program that you using to protect

244
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,710
perhaps you make hammer's right so it is
the business that we're in plus when you

245
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:25,900
look at things like DDoS and scalability
we are typically more typically better

246
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,900
built to withstand that type of thing

247
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:34,999
number eight

248
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:46,629
multi-tenant cloud exposed privacy
concerns big topic there are there are a

249
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:50,389
lot of misc under the Privacy side of
things and if you ever want to talk

250
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:54,428
about it I'll be happy to I was the
cloud Privacy Officer for the cloud

251
00:18:54,429 --> 00:19:00,570
division of ASAP for several years
there's a lot of missed in the privacy

252
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:07,629
realm the reality is if you're going to
attack and look for date if you're going

253
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:11,459
to try and get after data in a
multi-tenant environment hypervisor

254
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,109
would probably be the most proposed way
to attack it there's a couple others

255
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:20,899
will talk about this in a second but I
have not seen one that's been successful

256
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:24,478
I can't think of one today so if anybody
knows a good hypervisor tack on a cloud

257
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:31,320
provider please let me know cos I would
love to included the reality is on this

258
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,668
side if you're gonna go after data
center cloud provider is going to be a

259
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:40,559
much more pedestrian attack right you're
not going to try and attack the the

260
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,499
cloud provider and jump from one
customer to another you're gonna go

261
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:49,389
after you know spearfishing the
administrator of that cloud provider

262
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:54,349
right so you as a customer services
you've assigned an administrator we're

263
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:56,960
gonna figure out who the administrator
is go after that administering now get

264
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,080
access to your cloud environment and I
will do that

265
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,549
customer to customer to customer if I
wanted to go after the cloud provided

266
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:09,690
themselves I'm gonna go after their
administrators look for the back and

267
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,460
management this is a subject that I
cannot stress enough in the years that I

268
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,499
was working in selling a char systems in
Germany from an American company that

269
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:24,479
they said would never be done because of
the data privacy issues very few ever

270
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:28,080
ask me very few customers ever asked me
about the backend administration systems

271
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,939
right the management now something that
you need this is a discussion you have

272
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,759
to have with your cloud provider or
anybody who's selling cloud services you

273
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:38,570
need the transparency into

274
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,908
what is it that they do how do they do
it

275
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:45,549
what access to their operations
personnel have how did they get their

276
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:50,860
operations personnel because again go
back to insider threat you now have to

277
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,850
be a little bit concerned with not
insider threats you want to make sure

278
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,719
that that

279
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:02,140
sorry you want to make sure that that
threat is dealt with before it becomes

280
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:10,630
an issue so in the in the back end you
also want to look at what's the

281
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,419
certification that happens right I so
shocked to what's happening back there

282
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:21,090
and how does that translate now
regulations can kill a deal

283
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:25,860
absolutely understand your regulations
as as was mentioned earlier as well

284
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,659
the U S has no privacy regulations we
have a lot of different things are based

285
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:38,409
on industry we had you'll be a we have
PCI we have all these different industry

286
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:43,700
level regulations we have some
state-level registries six state level

287
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:50,909
stuff massachusetts but we do not have
that sweeping control or law that in the

288
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,080
case of Europe there's there's a
directive in each country puts in their

289
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,850
own law but we don't have that yet I'm I
i've got a different opinion of the last

290
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,719
speaker in that I hope that we get
something but I hope it is not to the

291
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,100
extent that the europeans are put in
because if you ever tried to do business

292
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,149
in Europe it is very very difficult
because everything is PII and there is a

293
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,860
massive wealth of control that has to be
put around it to know what your

294
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,520
regulations are know what industry
you're in understand what they are but

295
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,400
there should not be a cloud vendor that
can't address the issues now if you have

296
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,740
health data and they are not on board
with hippo walk away go to another

297
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:33,020
vendor that is on board the ship I do
caution compliance does not equal

298
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,110
security right because we are now
looking at the hospitals are getting

299
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:43,240
murdered with locky and crypto and they
are all complain they all have the check

300
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:50,070
boxes target had PCI and they got hit on
the credit card side so compliance does

301
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:54,970
not equal security in fact I would say
remembered that checkbox vulnerability

302
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,030
is probably the worst thing you could
deal with right when you've got all

303
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,030
those boxes check and they walk in you
don't know about it

304
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:12,600
number nine transparency again this is
incredibly important location does not

305
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:19,719
denote security nor does it denote
transparency if you buy a box from any

306
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,890
of the vendors racket plug it in

307
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,340
you have no more transparency into that
box than you have with a cloud provider

308
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:31,740
you got new ministry to log in their
administrative login with the cloud you

309
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,059
don't have the code was built you don't
know what the box does the only

310
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:38,830
difference is it's a comfort it's an
emotional discussion where I can look at

311
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:44,030
the box I can see the box 90 no one's
touched that box physical environmental

312
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:48,399
controls around cloud provider should be
part of your discussion that when you do

313
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,750
know who touched the box who comes in
and handles Bush who has access to the

314
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:58,080
box but beyond that it's just a box you
don't know what's going on in there how

315
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,080
many people here have a company that use
a Salesforce

316
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,879
expect more sales force to seem so
predominant but that's there's a decent

317
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,910
amount they have you guys where they
have trust us salesforce.com yeah that's

318
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,880
where they will show you everything
about their cloud zscaler will do the

319
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,900
same thing trusted these killer dot com
go to its public and go have a look at

320
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:27,260
it the need for transparency is what
builds the trust we will tell you if

321
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,600
we're down if if for some reason today
and the Columbus node bottoms out in

322
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,809
tanks and we rewrote traffic which we
should and that's part of our US

323
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,480
elections five nines we rewrote it to
the Cleveland note and you never even

324
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,250
noticed what we tell you about it yes
your cloud vendor should tell you about

325
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,800
it you shouldn't hear from another
customer you shouldn't hear from

326
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,830
conversation when you got a min straight
on the phone with a tam tam says

327
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:55,960
something about last week's outage and
you know I shouldn't that conversation

328
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,610
never happened you should be able to go
look at it finally acts find a robust

329
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,199
because the reality in this world is the
shit bricks all the time

330
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,090
right this is going to break there isn't
a cloud provider gonna say nothing's

331
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:12,040
gonna break right they may say you will
notice it when it breaks but it will all

332
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,010
break it's an imperfect

333
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,850
old hardware failure software failures
bad code rush job on something it's

334
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:25,550
going to happen so again this is going
back to the the Sox audits or the ISO

335
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:29,590
certification when you get into the into
dealing with transparency and

336
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,570
understanding what happens you need to
take those audits and do not take them

337
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,879
the day before the contracts being
signed where they check it over the

338
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,840
fence and say here they've got the audit
and you say okay that audit is the

339
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,780
baseline for what you have to do around
security that's the starting point it

340
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,139
should not be the end point you need to
take that need to that contract and you

341
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,380
need to take the audit need to put the
two together and say what lines up and

342
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:04,230
it's the hot it's not how it's the what
it's the end state never there's no

343
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,760
point going to a club provider and
saying I want you to do this security

344
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,879
thing this way right that's not going to
work

345
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,930
cloud providers are multi-tenant they
have thousands tens of thousands of

346
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,920
customers they're going to do their
stuff one way and one way only if they

347
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,810
do it multiple ways that is a recipe for
disaster

348
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,940
it will break they will screw up you
know customer is procedure with customer

349
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,780
be their operations has to happen one
way and that way has to be pointed it

350
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,960
right so you take that and that's your
starting point you compare that to you

351
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,070
live it up maybe hit eighty percent of
what you need now you have a

352
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,050
conversation for the last 20 percent
goes in the contract and always

353
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,409
discussed the what you're trying to
achieve what is your

354
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:48,720
what is it that you do that you're
trying to achieve that they don't have

355
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,030
to worry about how you can discuss the
how late are you giving recommendations

356
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,970
doesn't matter if it's seven characters
or 12 characters on a password is a

357
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,210
matter for change three times a week or
nine times a week I can't tell you the

358
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,540
number of discussions or arguments I've
had where they've said no it has to be a

359
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,620
characters and I have to say no it's six
but it changes every 30 seconds cuz it's

360
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,500
a one-time password I'm using our site
tokens and customers will not accept

361
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,630
that because no it's gotta be a
character's right so it's not the how

362
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,770
it's what are you trying to achieve
again you want to make sure that at the

363
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:26,230
end of it what you have bought is equal
to or better than what you would put in

364
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:33,750
yourself I that's really what you're
aiming for the last point not all clouds

365
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,040
are created equal

366
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:41,980
if you have just because you're dealing
with a well-known name in the software

367
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:47,460
industry do not assume the cloud is
great perfect order or anything

368
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,560
the same conversation has to happen if
their startup mid-size or one of the

369
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,860
Bemis and I would venture that there are
actually certain ones that you want to

370
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,149
have the conversation more with but how
the conversation

371
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:06,510
don't take it at face value just because
there's a reputation as a name and

372
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:15,430
finally appliances are more reliable
than cloud know most companies are not

373
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:19,690
in the business of I T right most
companies have a purpose a business that

374
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,260
they're in and I T supports that
business so they're not in the business

375
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,100
of my team they're not going to have a
very deep budget there I T departments

376
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,679
going to be a cost center they're gonna
fight for every single dollar that they

377
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,000
invest and I'm sure a lot of you guys
have to have those conversations are you

378
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,660
fight for every dollar budget time and
then in February when the clawback 10%

379
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,620
you fight to get down to it I'll eat eat
maybe six because you're trying to get

380
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,020
the programs in that you want right

381
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:50,190
the cloud vendors security is their
business right yes they will build an

382
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,980
EHR system yes they will build a finance
system but we live and die by our

383
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:59,290
reputations and if somebody is down for
fifteen minutes that's news if

384
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,510
somebody's breached the trust is gone I
mean would you stay with a customer with

385
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,620
a vendor that's reached with you at
least go back and have a right to audit

386
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,870
so the reality is when you deal with
with the I T groups how many guys in

387
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:19,419
here have ever gotten an SLA from there
I T group in the building at 42 good and

388
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:24,990
a half I saw a sort of a kind of it was
you know we got it'll be up during the

389
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,240
week

390
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,940
but that it was a graduate you gotta
fight for it right you know when you go

391
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,800
to a convent they should be handing you
an SLA what's the best I've ever seen on

392
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,580
hardware for hours new hardware it's
usually but the best one I've ever seen

393
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,570
so that means whatever a pre-built
internally if it doesn't have to

394
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:50,360
and by the way that's if thats hot cold
right whether it's bill for capacity you

395
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,949
have to build it so that you can lose at
least one full machine for four hours

396
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,500
plus recovery plus on packaging plus
getting the guy driving to pick it up

397
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,010
all of that has to be built into the
cloud providers should be and again

398
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,560
these are should be sneeze or not
absolute this is not a sweeping

399
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,870
recommendation that everything belongs
in the club's everything doesn't belong

400
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,000
in the cloud and this is not a sweeping
recommendation that every cloud vendor

401
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,450
is better than there are certain things
that customers customers will do on

402
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,580
prime and this is where you make your
decisions this is where you look at

403
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,379
application a new application being
application CNSE looks he's never going

404
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:29,570
outside because that's how we price you
know our gas fuel mixture in exon

405
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,720
whatever that's never going outside but
we can take these other to send them to

406
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,470
the cloud save some money there and take
that money and they'll refocus it under

407
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:41,000
security around on it gives you that
abilities that's what you want to make

408
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,010
sure that you were here in there and and
building that relationship that you do

409
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,930
have those isolated place plus you also
want to make sure that your contracts

410
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:53,550
have things like the right to audit this
used to drive everybody I worked with

411
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:58,610
nuts when I would put this out there but
the reality is when I asked you for a

412
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,929
chart data and I was gonna put it in my
system you need the right to audit by

413
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:06,370
European law it has to be there so we
were throwing up their front and you

414
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,739
have to have that that's what build that
trust because you may not executed and

415
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,460
you may not be able to fully control the
audit the way you want you too may not

416
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,890
get to come in and put your hands on the
box and run some scripts and commands on

417
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,520
it which you shouldn't because it's a
multi-tenant environment but you do have

418
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,950
the right to audit to look at certain
things and have certain evidence

419
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,040
presented to you to prove what it is
that they have come up with

420
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,940
so bad

421
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,400
we've got a couple minutes I will leave
it open to questions if there are any

422
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:43,100
happy to talk about it and by the way
again full 23 disclosure these killers a

423
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,620
cloud vendor for security if you want to
run a security test on your environment

424
00:31:46,620 --> 00:32:06,429
is non-invasive can be previewed at
cisco.com yes in the back those that may

425
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,490
not have heard it

426
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:13,260
different skills required to protect the
cloud environment versus on prime and

427
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:19,500
what should you do I don't know if
there's substantially different skill

428
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,020
set I think the proud the the
understanding of security professionals

429
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,910
around the bodies of knowledge that
we've learned how to protect data

430
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:33,120
applies right so you do need to have I
would recommend that whoever is dealing

431
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:42,719
with your your security planning so if
you've got a few got an enterprise where

432
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,770
your business units going to come to you
and ask for a system that or they bring

433
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,950
you a system like a cloud hey we want to
use this cloud one that you have

434
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,210
somebody that can do a basic sweep of
what it is

435
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:01,690
the data is so you've got your data
classification being done to control

436
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,670
that need to be put against it and then
you want to start looking at how to

437
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:10,290
assess the bender so assessment would be
a good one I would recommend sitting

438
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:15,420
with your legal team I spent years again
I'm not a lawyer either but I spent

439
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,000
years with the legal team I read a
contract probably as well as a lawyer

440
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,780
and I can read a security contract
probably better than aware because you

441
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:27,030
want to be intimate knowledge you have
on security and data classification and

442
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:30,970
be able to apply the legal understanding
of how it's written you know I hate the

443
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,970
word to meet you can't have the word
immediately contract rice people judge

444
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,090
me nuts but

445
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,090
that I would I would start with that
assessment

446
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,230
sort of an audit if you will I'm a big
advocate of Scrum teams right so if you

447
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,990
can build a security team that has an
auditor on it the documentation

448
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:52,750
specialist maybe a sec UPS guy somebody
understands law legal clerk that type of

449
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,340
thing you've got a really good team
starting to understand how to implement

450
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:06,789
these solutions anything else know guys
then thank you I believe it slides will

451
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:10,060
be available if they're not you can grab
me directly I'll get your copy of them

452
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,070
if anything I hope this makes it easier
for you to have a conversation

453
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:17,119
internally and with your cloud vendors
are club members will hate me for this

454
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,629
kind of thing but hey that's what we
gotta do this keeps us honest I ask the

455
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:24,040
questions and I'm willing if you want
you know hit me up afterwards an email

456
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,389
or something if you want to talk more
about it thank you
