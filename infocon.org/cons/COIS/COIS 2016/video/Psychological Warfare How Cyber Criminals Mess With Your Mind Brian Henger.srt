1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,330
you folks ready ok guys a couple minutes
late but that's alright because I don't

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,530
know his musical 25 minutes anyways me
Bryan anger I am the regional vice

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,198
president for president called
Malwarebytes quick show and have been

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,170
rumored Malwarebytes

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,699
lady lovely lady stop by the booth
earlier and say to your marketing

6
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:29,029
campaigns should be described as he said

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,989
total number of times you've saved my
ass basically then have like a number

8
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,690
rushing clucking side of it like you
said so

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,949
ok guys they asked us to these
presentations to be non somewhat venturi

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,210
no way more kind of academic and in a
way to talk about industry related types

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,770
of topics so the premise of the
conversation today is gonna be driven

12
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,230
around psychological warfare
psychological manipulation I'll apply it

13
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,148
specifically to the tactics that bad
guys are using if there sometime at the

14
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:04,839
end of this week at some we do I do it a
couple of sliders the end there about

15
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:10,580
some new anti ransomware technology that
we are creating right now that's a bit

16
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,740
of a hot topic for folks so it's time
permitting we'll get into that if not we

17
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:21,679
can just done with this so we generally
quickly is kind of a quick peek at the

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,500
threat outlook the evolution of online
advertising tactics what type of

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,049
cybercriminals find appealing about
advertising psychological manipulation

20
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,530
however tasers and cybercriminals are
working together what psychological

21
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,290
tactics are used by the bad guys and
then some reasonably simple tactics for

22
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,430
people to protect themselves from
psychological manipulation and some time

23
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:52,170
permitting maybe a little bit about us
so an introduction to online advertising

24
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,630
so it really makes sense you should step
back for a second then take a look at

25
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,570
the premise of online advertising it is
a business that say ten years ago fifty

26
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,559
years ago wasn't it

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,720
nearly prominent is it is in today it is
really a conversation or it's it's a

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,060
it's a technology that used between
website publishers advertisers people

29
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,890
are creating products you know
essentially it's an exchange between us

30
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,540
the user and website often the ad
networks themselves are not delivered by

31
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,660
the actual publisher themselves they're
they're they're built delivered by other

32
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,370
companies but in essence the tactics
that online advertisers have been using

33
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,880
have been in kind of a transformation in
the last five or so years so if you

34
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,019
cannot look back

35
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:46,010
think back maybe say even ten years ago
the premise of click Bay Rays used very

36
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,170
infrequently for a website state now the
idea of quick pay more sensational types

37
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,220
of concepts in advertising go back for a
hundred years like the idea that we're

38
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,920
going to use sensational claims are bold
types of imagery to attract people to

39
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,540
look at certain images in a certain way
to kind of draw them into the message

40
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,329
that you want

41
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,950
has been used in advertising for years
and actually advertisers have been on

42
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:17,140
the forefront psychological manipulation
or were really significant amount of

43
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,510
time lots of money is spent billions
dollars a year spent on research

44
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,149
specifically around what would we
respond to is a user what imagery works

45
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,280
what calls to action work what things
will manipulate a person to take action

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,650
today and so you know the the premise of
online advertising it it's evolved in

47
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,959
the last 10 years has really started to
adopt the same concepts that you would

48
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,560
see used in regular TV advertising a
newspaper advertising and those promises

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,160
are really started to you wolves now the
premise like the idea that that click

50
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,190
bait wasn't as prominent it used to be

51
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,170
think back that seeing the sensational
claims like congratulations you're a

52
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,660
winner as a pop up or you could lose 50
pounds these ideas brewing you would

53
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,440
see them in the past you know on on
sites that were maybe some of the more

54
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,170
unsavory places to go on the internet
and so it was just been about last five

55
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,760
or six or seven years that you started
to see click Fix show up and much more

56
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,450
prominent locations like if you just go
to BuzzFeed Huffington Post or Yahoo

57
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,780
many many of these publishers are using
our online advertising tactics as ways

58
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,940
to drive attention to sites and so they
did now that click bader sensational

59
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,540
titles is started to evolve for
something that we see on a daily basis

60
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,870
is far more common practice it relates
to online advertising now the challenge

61
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,480
from an online advertising perspective
to use its complex right often ad

62
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,940
networks are layered they're often
advertisers will sell to creative art

63
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,790
publishers in ways in which the people
who are buying the ads are not amiss

64
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,460
it's really difficult to actually track
back to the system and determine who

65
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,669
made the purchase and so just a mere
complexity of online advertising

66
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,450
actually makes it somewhat difficult to
identify who's who's who's actually

67
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:14,800
driving the content per se and the
premise from targeting specific

68
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,710
demographic is still very very much in
practice so the the advertiser long time

69
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,479
ago figured out that they want to tailor
messages for very specific audience and

70
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:31,419
and so they they start to do a lot of
analysis of age groups genders locations

71
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:36,180
specific times of the day I mean they
give you look at all that you listen to

72
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,290
the radio are you watch advertisements
they're they're under percent built

73
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,320
around audience specifically thats
looking at that information today so now

74
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,400
this is kind of moved directly into the
online advertising world as well and

75
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,690
what's happening is that the modern
browser will present a tremendous amount

76
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,450
of information back to online
advertisers the amount of information

77
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:02,500
that somebody can learn about you from
just your browsing habits is is really

78
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,129
scary actually they can determine

79
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:08,929
what times you browse where you browse
what your system is what kind of

80
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:13,558
information you have what social media
sites you go to the advertisers collect

81
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:17,309
a tremendous amount of demographic
information about us specifically so

82
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:22,989
they can serve ads and information back
to us in a way that would be compelling

83
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:28,279
for us to look at those advertisements
now unfortunately the threat actors have

84
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,389
learned using tactics and so threat
actors will often delivered their

85
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:37,240
content in their information back to
users specifically tailored for the

86
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,300
interest that they have for the Texas
systems that they have for Wednesday

87
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,080
browse when they don't like there's
there's the idea that now

88
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,459
bad guys have started to leverage the
tactic that advertisers are using an had

89
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,769
used to be effective

90
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:55,559
has become far more commonplace today
and they build their campaigns

91
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:58,559
specifically to be effective

92
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,490
based upon the demographics in the
target profile the audience that there

93
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:06,479
that they're working with the
cybercriminals an advertiser working

94
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,008
together this is kind of a gray area is
a lot of folks to know we see your don't

95
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:17,129
know about today so so often people who
are programmers they were right stuff

96
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:21,759
they're called earlier with whip up
sorry we call them potentially unwanted

97
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,899
programs something called pumps to a
tremendously unwanted modifiers

98
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:31,279
basically these these these are programs
that I would say by nature are malicious

99
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,419
but they kind of are the gateway to
malicious activity what happens a lot as

100
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:41,219
advertisers work with pup creators to
build pups to actually help drive

101
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:45,379
advertising revenues so public will come
in many forms and fashions they can be

102
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:49,969
toolbars thinking being browser pop-up
windows through programs essentially

103
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:54,509
built to drive you towards some other
location right now and often the

104
00:07:54,509 --> 00:08:00,550
advertisers are paying the pub offers to
create that linkage so many times by

105
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,740
lists they can get information from
breaches they can get millions of email

106
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,600
addresses they can create spam campaigns
they can leverage the pub offers

107
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,120
to be more effective in delivering the
message that they have today so what can

108
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,040
happen is that at the end of the day
while you're just joining your computer

109
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,250
experience the pub offers could be
pushing you and directions based upon

110
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:29,100
the exact same target demographics based
on the exact same you know psychological

111
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:37,520
manipulation that the advertiser using
to be effective with their ads so

112
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,189
classic advertising tactics used by
criminals so this is now that we're bad

113
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,180
guys have pivoted and started to say all
right we're gonna use the same

114
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,910
tried-and-true techniques that
advertisers are using because while it's

115
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,290
proven to be very effective for
capturing the attention you can be very

116
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,099
effective for driving traffic and for
helping threat actors to to to get their

117
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,230
malicious code on the computers and just
today so the first target identification

118
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:08,090
so the premise for target identification
is driven around knowing exactly what

119
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:13,830
your target audiences and knowing the
value of that target audience so I use

120
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,580
my parents is a good example of this so
by identifying the types of content that

121
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,940
my parents are interested in identifying
the times that they might browse my mom

122
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,560
died had to take a Windows 8 computer
back because they just could not make

123
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,390
the immediate the tiles than work and so
they literally had to go find Windows 7

124
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,930
machine by thanksgiving present you
could make the bad guys know and so they

125
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,939
often can make the connection between
what types of applications of these

126
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,910
people likely to be running when will
they be browsing websites where they'd

127
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,170
be using what is their availability and
and they will often use that information

128
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:55,270
to specifically build campaigns that are
effective against those users so the

129
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:00,410
idea of what is an effective attack that
so bad actors have pretty much

130
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,810
recognized that if you build your attack
in such a way that it is widely

131
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,709
dispersed you can give away some secrets
are always people follow 10 table or

132
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,420
abilities are but effectively exploiting
the zero-day vulnerability is it's not

133
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:15,819
that easy

134
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,050
to do it's not that easy to find it so
often when bad guys identifies your own

135
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,430
abilities they don't want those to be
made well known and so they actually

136
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:31,160
have shifted tactics specifically what
used to be kind of spray across wide

137
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,770
audiences of people and hope to get you
know technically lucky they actually

138
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,240
started to narrow their focus they don't
want to deliver components of attacks

139
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,960
that then law enforcement or security
companies will learn what are the

140
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,760
components of that so they've typically
started to build tactics around who is

141
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,900
my target with how to identify them and
then let specifically built campaigns

142
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,510
directly towards those people those are
targeted text now that happens in many

143
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,540
many different ways there are two
different fashions I'll go over some arm

144
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,500
as they happen right now this last year
was probably the biggest exploding area

145
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,370
for the for the malware delivery that
was happening it was a big team and 2015

146
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,570
in this kind of tags right along with
what's an effective tax why would I want

147
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,370
to do target identification how many
people are familiar with work now over

148
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:28,020
time is small group so now we're taking
it this premise of basically putting

149
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,550
malicious content into an ad network
which then is served on some other

150
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:39,890
publishers website so there have been a
whole bunch of highly what I say well

151
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:47,250
known sites that like Yahoo Finance and
Huffington Post and and bus speed and

152
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,320
others and Hermes right where these
sites were delivering now finding

153
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,890
someone given day was delivering over
tighten campaign 200 million users now

154
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,810
the idea from advertising and target
identification is that I would

155
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,609
specifically wanna compromised websites
that my parents would most likely go to

156
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:10,710
and I would specifically want to place
exploit technologies that exploit

157
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,690
applications that are specifically the
types of applications that my parents

158
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:19,310
you and so I will go and compromise the
website not necessarily website but

159
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,250
maybe the ad network that delivering
content on that web site and my parents

160
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,209
will land on that website and without
any initiation no clicking known

161
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,939
nothing they will effectively become
infected based upon the bad guys just

162
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:37,199
knowing what applications they can
exploit as they've done their target

163
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:41,498
identification they know what an
effective tax will be tested it against

164
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:45,759
services that exist in the world they
spent a lot of time and effort ensuring

165
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:51,850
the high success rates of these attacks
what makes this very lucrative very

166
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,699
possible for bad guys is the concept of
real-time bidding so real time bidding

167
00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:02,258
is a mechanism in the online advertising
world that allows advertisers to auction

168
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:06,449
off advertising space to people who are
going to either be the highest bidder

169
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:12,059
and they often will bid this in terms of
either pay per clicks pay-per-views

170
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:18,179
paper repressions all these terms
basically are mechanisms that allow the

171
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:22,459
advertising publishers to make money but
they make it very economically powerful

172
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:28,508
than a simple way to deliver malicious
advertising per say that's not only

173
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:32,309
effective but is built specifically for
the people that they're getting it today

174
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:37,879
so you know the the user at this point
isn't necessarily being manipulated he's

175
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:42,939
being psychologically analyzed and then
delivered based upon exactly what would

176
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:50,860
be relevant and important into a
watering hole attacks and exploits the

177
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,779
premise here is essentially to study the
efforts here again and to look at this

178
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:59,399
specifically where do people like to
hang out the example that we're giving

179
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,629
away here is a developer site as an SDK
site for iPhone developers are all apple

180
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:10,100
and orange and so essentially the back
has just placed information on a warrant

181
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,339
they they know these developers and go
to this site

182
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:15,819
he know exactly the types of systems
these people are using you know exactly

183
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:19,589
what they'll respond to and they
basically explain the start placing

184
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:23,439
exploits on this site that would
specifically target those individuals

185
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:28,509
those individuals like going here they
get information this is a valuable site

186
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:31,679
for them this helps them do their job
they don't even know they're being

187
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,699
exploited background but effectively

188
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,230
the techniques are all based upon
identification effective targeting

189
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:45,290
specific demographic social networking
attacks and click OK

190
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:53,370
so social networking is a test and
social network so users of social

191
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,010
networking security guys get really
social network

192
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,069
amount of information that we make
available to the world is meeting I was

193
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,490
at the RSA show here recently and I was
talking with gentleman who actually won

194
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:12,750
the black hat capture the flag
competition and the formation that he

195
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,940
had a baby and about really thirty
seconds i mean he he knew the last place

196
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,760
I was computing from he knew you know
where all the information that I would

197
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,080
need to be used to be responsive to its
claims actually that our children right

198
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,710
now to this is you can see the attack of
the first one over top of the snake is

199
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:36,310
hijacked a Skype account and so was
essentially the bad guys will do is

200
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,369
hijacked escape counter create a new
Skype account or create a social media

201
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:46,850
com Facebook Linkedin would you pick and
they'll then capture all of the friends

202
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,600
they want to hijack an account they
would likely go to the friends that I

203
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,370
haven't either Facebook or LinkedIn
their capture all those names and they

204
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,850
would impersonate one of those people
they would then get message delivered to

205
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,910
me that will come from somebody that I
know that message as you can see in this

206
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,939
particular one is lol is this your new
profile pic this is a direct call the

207
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,580
ppl self-image this isn't her collar
people self-esteem when you say to

208
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,440
somebody hey that's funny picture you
look really great or in some way you

209
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,380
kind of calling upon you know their
self-image people are very responsive to

210
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,439
that they they they wanna wait to see
what picture on the internet right now

211
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,680
and so bad guys know specifically the
types of things have been social

212
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,250
networking that will respond to and the
ease with which you can identify you

213
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,050
know cracked accounts hijacked accounts
breached counts those that that's

214
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:41,449
reasonably simple to do it so the degree
to which social networking scams can be

215
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,780
very effective are high because our
willingness is people to want to respond

216
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,470
to somebody who's making a call to our

217
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,520
the second is known as an example of
more modern click based on how many

218
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,770
people right now it seems he's really
crazy videos are i mean they're they're

219
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,540
great you know who doesn't wanna see
that shared you can see the one where

220
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:08,440
that giant tuna comes and eats shark
that was on Facebook if it was malicious

221
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,870
I would have it would have been bad for
me but the work or not work late so bad

222
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:19,489
but the the the point being that modern
click baby has really evolved a lot like

223
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,300
dating David using sensational titles
they want you to click on these things

224
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,860
they pick videos on topics that are very
cool right like they stopped why would

225
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,530
you look at something that you know is
very exciting

226
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:36,830
they know exactly how to position
content information and they'll draw you

227
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,030
two sites often if you click on
something i Facebook it also takes you

228
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:46,200
to another site sometimes that other
site may not have any anything on it all

229
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,870
except an ad network that serving an
exploit kit that was compromised by the

230
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:55,310
bad guys because factory they bought the
ad campaign that saw the whole thing

231
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,879
started with this click fate that got me
excited to go take a look at this video

232
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,410
so the idea from a guys did create
really sensational titles and things

233
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,410
that are catchy and like that's the
whole premise

234
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,030
I would probably watch huge thank you to
me are I like that that's something I

235
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:17,470
would take a look at and that's just one
of what are thousands of videos if not

236
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,730
hundreds of thousands probably more like
tens of millions of happening on a daily

237
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,810
basis there are all built by people who
completely understand what captures our

238
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,820
attention who becomes really easy
actually to educate people much easier

239
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,129
to get people to places that you can
deliver malicious code then you probably

240
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,520
could imagine

241
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,379
here's the really scary thing about the
FBI agents and was scope the user

242
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,670
doesn't do anything and exploit kit will
send out a script that essential will

243
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,890
assess what the applications are in your
system often there will be multiple

244
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,030
exploit kit on our site it will look for
the most highly available

245
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,669
application to exploit it will do it in
milliseconds there won't be any screen

246
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,490
will be nothing that slows down you
won't see anything happen in the

247
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,790
background it will deliver next week it
that they know was effective and your

248
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,360
machine will be compromised and you
won't know it in the goal behind it will

249
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,679
not to be to show anybody it will
actually to be is still quite as

250
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,100
possible and it all starts office
premises something that I was really

251
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,350
scams and social sharing it work anybody
called by the companies that are saying

252
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,550
that your machine was in bad shape and
that you might wanna buy have had to

253
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:31,290
talk I'm actually there's a really good
and bad is really a factor what happen

254
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,379
right now that we're blogging on it the
Malwarebytes website we just start

255
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,200
blogging on this a couple of days ago so
now because people can you locate your

256
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,260
IP address to a very specific area I can
tell exactly what ISP you're using know

257
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,010
immediately and so there's a really
slick one go around right now the

258
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:52,410
eighteen thirties contacting people and
letting them know that their systems

259
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:57,570
being compromised now I use ATT home and
it looks very legit they have videos

260
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:03,340
they have information it all looks like
AT&T when you call they say you need to

261
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,750
immediately call all these indicators in
your system they scare you think they

262
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:13,450
they are psychologically trying to freak
you out and then they want money and

263
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,230
they're gonna give you this package that
you keep your computer clean for the

264
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,890
next three years we participated being
Malwarebytes 120 million dollar FTC

265
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:31,740
lawsuits against companies in Florida
that were running this scam the company

266
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,460
in Florida that we said Chile were
working for the FTC or or expert witness

267
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:44,350
century AD three thousand people call
center we actually hiring one of the

268
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:49,250
guys because he was a good engineer and
he told us all about the scam he said

269
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,380
the FBI came in and shut him down he
said took all the computers and a week

270
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,350
later they just opened up a mile away
just nothing stopped and other soon I'm

271
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,000
those scams are making hundreds of
millions of dollars it's not a little

272
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,420
bit

273
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,580
people get scared they they react they
will believe that people if you present

274
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,840
them with enough compelling information
that is legitimate Lee ok that that's my

275
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,620
ISP this looks real and they say have a
problem my part my parents who believe

276
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:24,409
that's the kind of stuff that gets my
mom chill chilli and so the idea that we

277
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:29,680
can personalize these schemes now and
make them very real for people is a call

278
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,150
to just pure fear rightly they are just
controlling new they're saying don't

279
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,960
take action that things will happen and
so they're very effective ways for

280
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:46,730
people to you know to be manipulated as
it relates to scams and social this big

281
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,390
topic lately I don't know if anybody has
had the unfortunate experience

282
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:55,920
illustrates where it's it's growing
problem there was already a problem is

283
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:03,510
getting worse there was a hospital in
kentucky last week that news but

284
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,350
effectively they put a red banner across
the top of their main page on our

285
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,360
website it says the hospital being
compromised by Brandt somewhere and if

286
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,280
they were declaring a state of emergency
they had enacted their emergency

287
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:22,460
response plan in this is part two if
they had a tornado or you know really

288
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,350
really bad even restore more fire like
they looked at this event as

289
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,730
life-threatening because systems were
compromised that that dealt people's

290
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,710
lives so the premise around ransomware
is at least relate psychological

291
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:42,980
manipulation is even worse so there's
this concept called assumed guilt now

292
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,950
there's something on my machine I didn't
put it on mine she is still on my

293
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:53,680
machine and so if a bad guy where to
slash in front of your face a picture of

294
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,150
child pornography on your computer that
precal like I'm pretty sure they lock up

295
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:07,100
your job you know you know don't take it
does not matter and people do

296
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:13,409
/ message from the FBI that we've
identified information on your machine

297
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:18,280
it's consistent with something illegal
have locked your files right taking an

298
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,139
action right now that you must respond
to or you will go to jail people freak

299
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:28,750
out we track the case that led to a
suicide man literally was being

300
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:35,570
basically extorted and they were using
child pornography is to do that and get

301
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,639
so scared that he wanted to make a
really really bad joins a permanent

302
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,450
solution to a temporary problem so this
one right now really really really scary

303
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:51,120
one in the sense that people freak out
like they don't know what to do he paid

304
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,059
a ransom they want our situation they're
in and it's all because they're scared

305
00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:01,520
really scared and technology that's
coming out really how we can identify

306
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,470
these texts in some ways has lagged bad
guys bad guys doing some very very

307
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,720
innovative type of work at hiding their
their techniques abdicating their

308
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:19,090
attacks making it very difficult to undo
the changes that that ransomware me so

309
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,850
smart phones not so smart users who like
to say that cuz I think the tactics are

310
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:31,139
i would tell you now I mean it past you
sale just to know what you're doing the

311
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,490
eighty people know what you're doing you
guys are but quite honestly know the

312
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:39,710
techniques are so sophisticated that
even I keep and so the bottom line 44

313
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,830
you know really is that users know I
think the bad guys used proven tactics

314
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:49,610
that are capable of getting us to take
action so phishing scams work really

315
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:55,580
well we're a lot of people believe their
mobile home secure that people believe

316
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,199
that this is a platform that as an
attack people think that iOS is pretty

317
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,309
unbreakable but it's really not so much
that the iOS systems on break with that

318
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:09,720
I can give you things that you'll react
to because they're free or because you

319
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,809
know they're exciting because their
first down on the Android platform

320
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:19,970
attempt quite a bit more because Android
took position or position to make that

321
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,830
ecosystem

322
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:26,699
we're apple chosen ecosystem make that
was closed but you know the premise that

323
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:32,279
advertising on phones fishing on phones
free apps on phones that all then have

324
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:36,330
Trojan horses in the background as a way
to capture information about you or to

325
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:41,760
you use that as a means for effect phone
those are all on the rise today

326
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,700
thinking for four phones to is like
common sense that goes into how you

327
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,350
protect yourself from these types of
attacks for spearfishing in breaches I

328
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,399
work for a company that was a really
really cool were crowned email

329
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:01,928
vindication the original sin email was
that it was never built with any

330
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:06,840
authentication that anybody can send an
email purporting to be anybody I could

331
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,939
send you an email from yourself to
yourself I could send an email from God

332
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:17,730
to you like Hitler it's a great job and
the you know the the premise would be it

333
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:22,659
would come from the domain that you
would look we would you would you so

334
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:25,419
spearfishing and phishing attacks have
changed a lot

335
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:31,159
the used him bad spelling you could tell
the Nigerian banks camping and everybody

336
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:38,269
knew is grabbing just wasn't good but
much more sophisticated gets here about

337
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:43,080
the attack that just happened where like
eighty million dollars of a billion

338
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,460
dollar was a Russian hacking group I
think that was extorting the banks and

339
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,630
the card it because there was one
misspelling in one word it but if that's

340
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,529
not their get that right

341
00:26:54,529 --> 00:27:03,029
a billion dollars gets all
electronically wired and so you know for

342
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:07,940
us what we see is this rise on building
spear phishing messages again based upon

343
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:13,240
proven topics that will respond to the
latest exploit kit to text coming

344
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,610
informal Word macros are targeting EHR
systems which are apartments right now

345
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,789
they're using terms that would be very
consistent with how each other people

346
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:23,900
talk to each other

347
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,440
the emails are coming from legitimate
sources are this just happened about six

348
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:36,770
months ago to us so our CFO was sent an
email from we trusted and it was

349
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:42,470
requesting $80,000 wire transfer our CEO
who happens to be a 26 year old man by

350
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,940
the way so it's kind of interesting that
he caught this he didn't recall

351
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:52,750
authorizing $80,000 wire transfer
so-called smart sociable transfer and

352
00:27:52,750 --> 00:28:00,120
he's I don't know why but you know and
they traced back our CEO or CFO catfish

353
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:07,389
lot's changed via the likelihood right
now that targeting fishing specifically

354
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:11,570
people with messages that give your sea
level person you think you talk to your

355
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:16,260
general counsel lot to talk to your law
firm wrought by built a message that

356
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,510
came from the law firm that you talked
to bring it wouldn't be very very hard

357
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,280
to just read your annual report figure
out all the things that you're working

358
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,020
on what's going on with popular tapping
right now there's a lot of fish me

359
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:33,530
actually the premises that educate about
type messages or phishing emails because

360
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:42,290
they're built really really well built
on principles that we will respond to ok

361
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:48,020
so how do you protect yourself now
without going into a bunch of big

362
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,830
products that break here this is where
we keep this and I have we make a lot of

363
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,270
technology and a lot of the great
companies that are here right now make a

364
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:59,680
lot of Technology hope you just kind of
simple ideas around this use traditional

365
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:06,060
approaches use a virus software use any
malware software patch systems use

366
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,270
common sense that you think that it
looks a little odd or you haven't heard

367
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,740
something from that person or that
person wouldn't send you those types of

368
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:20,550
messages don't pick up the phone send
him an email did you send me something

369
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:26,580
anonymized data you can browse without
exposing all of your cookie is street

370
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,939
there's lots of websites now that you've
got to have to add blocking that's kind

371
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,960
of the new thing lot of people actually
with there's an hour by just making some

372
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,550
big investments in the kind of ad
blocking capabilities

373
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:42,120
up there today I had a website today
that said using ad blocking we don't

374
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:48,110
like that so there's ways in which you
can protect yourself online privacy

375
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,719
settings in browsers don't have to
expose yourself you know

376
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,090
yes here's the deal advertisers and web
sites are gonna have to figure out that

377
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,070
we're not going to expose all this
information to them for them to be

378
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:07,139
successful we hold the power we start
browsing anonymously privacy settings

379
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,950
and they can express their ads they
can't do things they need to be

380
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:18,760
effective would not say go to different
websites so use the right software and

381
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,580
hardware feature you haven't spoken to
people about investing in the right

382
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,139
technologies leverage that there are
settings in hardware now today that come

383
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:35,280
on the motherboard that protect data use
encryption if you can back up if you are

384
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,810
backed up fact that you can recover from
Iran's were attacked by just grabbing

385
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:47,870
right back and you don't have to serve
as an admin I think I can arrange like

386
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:52,709
90% of our tax wouldn't be effective at
the user's didn't have administrative

387
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:58,720
access no I get a team of folks that
work for me and when they can't load the

388
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,390
WebEx client on their machine because
they can install software doesn't have

389
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:07,720
admin rights or I can still print that
drives him crazy this kind of ongoing

390
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,010
battle among streets you know too much
and too little but there are ways in

391
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:16,070
which you can limit user rights to limit
your exposure to bad guys that are out

392
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:22,780
there today so hypertext really haven't
changed much cleaner not what we track

393
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:29,040
the the technology that bad guys are
actually using two sec systems has not

394
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,680
been done innovative it is not involved
that but the tactics that they're using

395
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:41,070
to get us to put that code on systems is
more innovation on how we deliver tax

396
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:46,210
how we be effective attacks how we
target them against specific people five

397
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,429
years ago really was just tired out
there

398
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:56,200
to seem to get enough stuff you meet
someone didn't you try to use layered

399
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:03,470
protection so any malware park on top of
an antivirus product use a firewall

400
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:10,590
setup as many ways in which you can
protect yourself and don't give them the

401
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:16,720
power so for us you are going right now
for this or dedicate folks help them to

402
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,740
get a feel for what their options are
you don't necessarily have to be a

403
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:28,970
victim of tactics that are targeting us
from a psychological manipulation so

404
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:35,679
quick will not to Malwarebytes company
was founded in 2008 we are growing quite

405
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:43,059
a bit we actually close to 400 employees
today the business is focused 1% I would

406
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:47,668
say he said the affection landscape but
zero hour exploits zero hour malware

407
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:53,080
advanced threat removal we've been the
global standard a lot of people in the

408
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,949
company of a roommate gone to
Malwarebytes because some system they

409
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,679
had may have failed them and they they
wanted to see if we could recover it and

410
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:06,049
often with our technology we can restore
that system remove not just a malicious

411
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:12,519
artifacts but all the novelist's
artifacts as well we are up to 400

412
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:17,179
people a two-thirds of those people are
engineers that are focused on the threat

413
00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:21,899
landscape either in the form of threat
intelligence or they're actually

414
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:26,689
building the technologies that are
adapting what we know about the threat

415
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:32,669
landscape day and often those that you
know go grab our prevention tools or our

416
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:34,779
our remediation tools learn

417
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:40,940
matriculation for Malwarebytes as people
say hey could prevent detect that you

418
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,919
guys just rumor and the short answer is
yes if we can remediated we could have

419
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:49,309
prevented it so many people's graduation
when they use our technology starts with

420
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:54,340
our our remediation relevance and then
hands with our prevention technologies

421
00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:00,379
hundred thousand businesses protected we
finished with 15 north of a hundred

422
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,550
million dollars of revenue now folks
know about us that people give away free

423
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:10,310
we have given away we believe it work
the three billion dollars of our

424
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:15,149
remediation technology for free as a
premise of helping to educate people on

425
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:20,020
a what we could prevent or help those
people out of out of a jam Lakers are

426
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,090
really interesting psychology that
happens with an hour by talk customers

427
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:29,669
talk about time I can tell you how many
people you walk up to beginning hey guys

428
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:36,370
really save my book that that concept
and you lots of people said why did you

429
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,839
give away three billion dollars worth of
software just a really interesting

430
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,980
psychology at the plate with which
somebody comes to Malwarebytes to

431
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,740
download our application they often are
really vulnerable state like they often

432
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:55,489
kind of nervous and we made a very clear
decision to not jack would like to not

433
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:00,419
give you some well yeah we'll help you
out on this but you know myself gonna

434
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,980
call you a little bit or something
degree we made a very conscious decision

435
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:09,480
over the 10 years in business just help
people and so our vision today is that

436
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:17,430
we believe everybody's our existence and
as long as you know you guys are are

437
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,649
there will help you got a chance our
mission is to build the best

438
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:25,920
disinfection and prevention technologies
in the reason the product has been

439
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,940
downloaded over 500 million pounds is
because the effect you don't use it

440
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,740
because we use and you know what we
would estimate just by the way in 2015

441
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:44,430
based upon not having to rebuild systems
and be able to fully remediated system

442
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,940
as opposed to rebuild it

443
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:51,310
2015 all we have to be saved 750 million
man hours that's based on the average

444
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:55,660
amount of time that stands in several
places would say is to repair system

445
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,170
that's been infected with malware 48
hours

446
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,270
eighty percent of enterprises today
choose to reimage systems that cost and

447
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:09,480
productivity in time to users is high
like 750 hours worked and so the idea

448
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,720
today that there are automated ways to
recover system

449
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,640
start to no good state exists you know
anyone given time we've got but 289

450
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,210
points are out there today one of the
really great things of giving away three

451
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,460
billion dollars worth of free software
is we collect a lot of information from

452
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:25,870
it

453
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:31,609
anonymized information course basically
threat of climate treaty because a lot

454
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:38,030
of detail about the worst of the worst
now we're focused on 00 exploits we

455
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:43,940
often our first text them first be able
to clean them as well and we get a lot

456
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:48,890
of that because we see very much the tip
of the spear the attack so we see what's

457
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:54,529
often really the worst of the worst we
make it 2 Solutions what we call him .

458
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:59,210
security breach remediation insecurities
are for prevention based technology

459
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:06,810
blocking 0 exploits here or malware zero
hour ransomware is providing advanced

460
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:12,290
threat removal the scalable centrally
managed solution that allows you to help

461
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:16,600
a century protect hundreds distance from
the central location or thousands of

462
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,049
systems and then the remediation
technology is being delivered under what

463
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:26,270
kind of an interesting new concept
called proactive malware hunting this

464
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:30,710
premise is driven around identifying
systems within an environment that may

465
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:35,100
or may not be showing any signs
whatsoever malware infection garnering

466
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,270
both estimate today that the average
dwell time for malware in a corporate

467
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:44,300
networks over 200 days often when people
run now its technology

468
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,180
their environment they're shocked to see
what we find we've had a lot of people

469
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:55,149
that like media take action based on the
evidence that comes back it's it can be

470
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:01,530
sobering for some folks so this is right

471
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,530
three minutes for questions

472
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:20,180
80 85% of modern malware is delivered
via an exploit kit and exploit kit is

473
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,049
essentially a scripted technology that
evaluates the most popular applications

474
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:27,770
that we use today for vulnerabilities
and then triggers of our ability

475
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:32,610
this is a mechanism to allow that bad
guy to install malware either in a

476
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:37,320
memory or hard drive and often have
malware that they've tested against

477
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,390
other computer virus Toro places the
test the effectiveness of this malware

478
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:45,279
against all the common endpoint
detection products are out there so what

479
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:52,300
I'm doing is say exploiting say Internet
Explorer or microsoft office to do two

480
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,980
types of different attacks wonderful
memory corruption attacks on a card

481
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:01,860
application design tax and so the rate
at which a technology works for us is we

482
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:06,110
are analyzing the behavior of the
applications and the operating system we

483
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:10,120
actually analyze all the API floated in
patients are making it when we see it

484
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,930
API play that's consistent with other
memory corruption attacks or a peace

485
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,310
sign of use tax we just kill those
processes from happening to 100%

486
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:22,340
behavioral based technology is no
signatures whatsoever in the premises

487
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,520
not what is the file that's being
delivered

488
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,390
how was the application training Iraq
with the operating system would have the

489
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:33,560
behavior that patient relationship the
operating system and when we see that we

490
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,930
really don't care if that if that
exploit kit is trying to deliver your

491
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:41,609
mom's you know kind of Christmas cookie
recipe or zero hour malware we just

492
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:45,780
killed the processes that would allow
for the for the escalation running a

493
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,830
file and so that's first that's the
first stage of Advantech that's about

494
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:54,860
85% modern our that leaves about fifteen
twenty percent of malware that would be

495
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:59,530
delivered today on a social engineering
scam or and mechanism other than and

496
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:03,820
exploit kits are no most commonly almost
all delivered in a drive-by download

497
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,850
that's why I'm advertising became so so
successful is I compromise the ad

498
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:13,890
network put the exploit kit in the ad
network user Lance just on the web page

499
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:17,020
of Yahoo Finance and it's this ad
network that Yahoo Finance has nothing

500
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,900
to do with that they're just selling
space on their website and now that

501
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,700
script

502
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,450
analyzes my browser terms the
applications that I had running on the

503
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:29,700
system and then download the script
which then that script runs it calls out

504
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,930
to other websites to cool down payloads
to collect sales that type of activity

505
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:37,560
is what we would see is behaviorally
wrong which would allow that to happen

506
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:44,150
if a file was to become existence on in
memory or hard disk then we have to

507
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,030
analyze that filed so the second
technology uses we called behavior here

508
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:53,630
Ristic engine engine essentially what it
looks at all the anomalies that exists

509
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,670
within a file today if you look at what
modern malware been built to do and how

510
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:01,840
it's built it is obligated is packed
weird they they do a lot of techniques

511
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,860
right now to try and hide what file is
in so we don't look at we don't look at

512
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,490
it like as a one-to-one

513
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:12,600
this is a bad file and we made a hash
for the bad file we look at the

514
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,880
behavioral characteristics of the file
we employ what's called post execution

515
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,340
blocking so as the file attempts to run
either from memory or the disk we would

516
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:25,890
stop that analyzed it look leaders tax
the third thing we're doing this would

517
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,910
have been if I have more times operates
more technology is we're analyzing how

518
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:34,020
processes and threads are created what
ransomware offers doing today which

519
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:38,770
really really interesting is there in
bedding their code into processes that

520
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:43,280
will often spawned other processes that
will create other thread that will they

521
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,250
four five and six layers deep to
actually then deliver the technique to

522
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:52,100
encrypt files are corrupt file system so
what we've done is create a system right

523
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,880
now that behaviorally analyzes how the
Reds and processes are working and what

524
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,590
the indicators are that they are showing
us so it a threat would be to create be

525
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:08,490
created that attempted to encrypt a file
rename the file delete the original

526
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:12,810
those are indicators of what would be
ransomware like activities if the thread

527
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:17,430
attempts to shut off the bowling chato
he billion that would be an indicator of

528
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,640
litter and where we do it for thread was
created turn up the volume shadow

529
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,370
service for thread was created it kind
of killed restore points with red was

530
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:30,089
created to call encryption keys or
thread was created to use a secure

531
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,810
delete utility

532
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:36,920
a whole bunch of indicators of behavior
they're consistent with either answer

533
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,570
where were bad guys are doing we keep an
index and a running total of all the

534
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:44,570
thread counts that we have it in a
window of time windows indicators go

535
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:48,620
above a certain threshold we identify
that file a potentially bad now the cool

536
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:52,640
thing about that is because they nest
those in a bit long set of injection

537
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,069
chains call what we'll do is not only a
rest of the process that's attempt to

538
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:03,120
grip the files will actually trace it
back and find instigating file we take

539
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,270
that is degrading file and we compared
it to a cloud-based list of what are

540
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:11,259
known good to keep a master wait so we
do two things to that we asked the

541
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,270
window sizzle would have protected file
and we compare it and if it's if it's

542
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:19,580
not a good file and we know it's not
protected and it has the indicators are

543
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:25,110
consistent with what ransomware are then
we make sensible so when you look at

544
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:28,080
that we look at the start of advanced
tech chain by looking at how the

545
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,830
application directly operating system
and we look at what a good behaviour of

546
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:36,310
the files themselves and what are the
behaviour of the files now doing an

547
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:41,509
operating system and what are those
indicators and that allows us to be

548
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:46,840
really effective at identifying Jerome
our 0 exploits and as a byproduct of the

549
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,930
benefit of having a giant installed base
of people who use our free stuff we get

550
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:57,000
telemetry data back into our and to our
threat researchers on a daily basis and

551
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:04,630
it's from 300 million so it's allowed us
to continue to be very very effective at

552
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:09,230
not only advanced removal which a lot of
people notice for but actual events

553
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:18,980
represents an email has been a wonderful
audience
