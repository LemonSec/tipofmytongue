1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,689
so let's start right away that we are here

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:05,879
to tench talk about something and we are

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,290
here to have fun

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,630
then we have to talk about tor factories

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,540
because I wanted to chat a bit with

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,429
you with factories because a

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,400
software that in my work and in the work

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,670
of many companies in my opinion allows you to

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,300
optimize project management and

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,789
software management and because the

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,650
manufacturer is a suite of

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,840
web applications for collaborative development,

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,668
therefore we are all used to

14
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,500
kitab all of us are used to

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,180
heat labs all of us are used to

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,239
lounge ad di bunt we are all used to

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,230
these  platforms here and one of these

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,899
and is entirely made up of components that

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,350
are completely free software

20
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,090
because I say components because factories

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,170
find a collection of tools

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,420
Meanwhile a nice thing is that the

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,850
renato building in the maze of a

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,829
large social network to manage their

25
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,920
projects that were  in svn then

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,000
factories back waters to track

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,119
anc  he of the source code in svn but

28
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,010
obviously then people started

29
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,110
to equip other tools as well as you say

30
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,549
mercurial things like that

31
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,470
so in age they find those

32
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,520


33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,950
multi standard examples in the sense that it is not like

34
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,890
guitar that is founded on you enough

35
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,500
is not  like other lounge pubs that once

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,659
only supported pazar and now

37
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,490
also supports factory kits 3 supports its own

38
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,569
for source code tracking

39
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,100
kit mercurial svn so this is already

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,289
an interesting thing then let's

41
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:48,630
start with factories how you can

42
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,179
improve the management of a  software

43
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:54,509
with tor factories first of all it is a

44
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,390
small personal installation that we

45
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,099
will take advantage of right now the first

46
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,479
thing a developer does is usually a

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,869
clear repository so we see it

48
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,340
right away just to see how

49
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,579
the interface is made then immediately asks me

50
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:12,360
what you me like  typology is precisely

51
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,069
this wonderful choice that not everyone

52
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,900
supports of club is based on beats

53
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,819
and so on we have it  already said and then I

54
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,980
decided I want repository for my

55
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,620
project that in kit

56
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,269
then I save the details of my project

57
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:30,389
and start to see that manufactured reasons

58
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:31,139
by tag

59
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:33,690
so if I now create a project

60
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,810
maybe this deposit

61
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,220
I mean if I do it because it was a

62
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,450
repository  and maybe my code

63
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,830
is linked to a project so

64
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,019
maybe I don't know is linked to a small

65
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,430
bus application called book

66
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,890
and vast or maybe also linked to another

67
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,260
project for example I don't know

68
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,989
the cultural association which is called

69
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:57,569
information in short, it is not a

70
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:00,239
toy already this important I

71
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,040
want to point it out in a toy

72
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,819
where each repository is a project no

73
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,769
each repository can be part of several

74
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,340
projects a bit like a lounge pub

75
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,400
let's go on

76
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,049
now I have created this repository

77
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:19,230
which has a very bad name r 43 39 and

78
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,640
already factory cool thing and

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,040
now that i can decide a lot of pers

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,799
of visibility options present in

81
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,760
this repository

82
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,980
i can say look  which must be

83
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,370
public as visibility or modifiable

84
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,879
by only me or only a certain

85
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,980
group or something very

86
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,530
personalized like I can say make sure

87
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,620
that three very specific users can

88
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,989
modify repository I don't know maybe I

89
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,730
list three names and I assign it to

90
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,310
this property of modification that  he

91
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,420
asks me who can go out in this

92
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,459
depositories I tell another to another

93
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:03,849
another group and he created repository now

94
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,709
we do something that can be modified by everyone

95
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,670
and create posito

96
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,250
fact manufacturer is at the top in

97
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,050
a hyper enterprise environment

98
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,060
so when one creates a repository

99
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,820
that is a matter  however it gives to do

100
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,500
carefully without it is not really a

101
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,120
game where you click and it immediately makes you

102
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,010
repositories no and it is important that you

103
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,230
immediately ask the right questions because you

104
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,910
could make big mistakes that

105
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,340
could cause the

106
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,110
destruction of all your work anyway, for

107
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,610
example the  publication of material

108
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,610
that is not to be published

109
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,720
or the modification of material  which

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,420
must not be changed in our case it is

111
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,040
all free source code so

112
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,850
we start activating the repository already

113
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,880
here factories it is interesting because

114
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,620
when I click on this button it activates

115
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,960
repository in reality I have already

116
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,830
configured it in the first place to tell it all the

117
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,330
characteristics of mine  server maybe

118
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,280
I had a hundred maybe I had one and

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,380
then he will decide which is the

120
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,670
best location for my

121
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,500
repository clear that in

122
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,660
the simplest settings of rho simply that it

123
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,970
is a folder on the single server

124
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,730
but he does everything automatically by

125
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,130
managing the resources  at best and

126
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,370
therefore looks like a good page where

127
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,520
I have a kit address that I can

128
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,410
use to make poole pusher kits

129
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,740
etc but manufactured it was not limited to

130
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,740
repository management yes the re

131
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,070
also trailed for task management

132
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,730
for example this is  a

133
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,130
factory installation for the association and wikimedia

134
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,950
foundation that one of the axes

135
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,420
that is the  foundation that manages

136
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,700
wikipedia and all related projects and

137
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,220
uses tour factories to manage everything uses

138
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,530
they use it for anything for all

139
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,540
four thousand deposit that maybe even

140
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,080
more this is an example of a task that is

141
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,360
a task to be done that someone has

142
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,420
marked and someone  asked

143
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,639
please

144
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,849
do this on this software so

145
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:08,009
we see that a pocket a title to a

146
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:10,729
description a tag

147
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:13,169
here too I repeat it is not a

148
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:17,039
kitab type toy where a sioux is linked to

149
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,259
a single project no a problem

150
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,240
we all know we all know  how many that in

151
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,949
reality the real world is not so trivial

152
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,650
where a problem is related to the code

153
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,189
no a problem can be linked to for

154
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,870
example here they have linked it to a

155
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,120
software called parsons but also

156
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,669
to the team that takes care of the platforms

157
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:40,590
and also to the unity of the warnings for

158
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,020
the user so this tusk that will be

159
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,909
completed by someone someone else

160
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:47,939
will have to do this work will have an impact

161
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,650
on the many projects so it is  just that

162
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,449
a task is not related to the single

163
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:51,900
project

164
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,250
still this one thing that I

165
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,490
really appreciate to make a jacket

166
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,169
interesting thing if by chance one of this

167
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:01,110
task said yes but I wrote

168
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,909
what to do but in reality it is not that there  it is

169
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:04,800
only one house to do there are many

170
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,990
things to do below so I could

171
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,939
create some under tusk and this is the

172
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:11,000
really useful thing because as we see then

173
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
it creates a very cool flat graph in

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,650
which it shows you all the dependencies of the

175
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,120
things to do  to perform this task in the best possible way

176
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,509
so we were here that

177
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,399
we had to carry out this pockets direct

178
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,919
live production traffic but I discover that

179
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,569
there are many dependencies there is to do

180
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:29,189
this problem I do not know if you see well

181
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:30,960
then all the dependencies of that same

182
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,879
problem and you create a  really

183
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,599
great thing if it's a big pocket so it can

184
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,460
also help me understand how to

185
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,560
best manage a project depending on how many

186
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,149
things there will be to do on that project

187
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:46,139
very quickly perc  hé then I would like to

188
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,649
leave room for the liter tsi with

189
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:52,409
actually manufacturer also hides other

190
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,060
tools such as a chat and a

191
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,520
notification system a blog to the director

192
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,360
a blogger is only pro

193
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,419
a mockup publishing system

194
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,430
maybe you have designers who want to

195
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,229
publish how it will be  a graphical

196
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:06,520
interface they have everything in their

197
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,349
space that this here called

198
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:10,449
mockup in which to publish their

199
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,879
photograph and people and select an

200
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,550
area they share it comment on the

201
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,810
specific false type this and

202
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,460
frog me maybe it sucks then the

203
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,979
selection and comment this  is your vol such

204
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:27,340
thing is still very

205
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,050
fast factories for it also contains

206
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,090
a calendar because maybe we want to

207
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,799
say that the developer will be there

208
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,289
on Thursday but next Thursday he will be

209
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,578
gone then I could report the presence

210
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:38,950
of people or events and then

211
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,529
filter the preparations etc.  fadoi

212
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:42,909
today I would never have remembered this

213
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,290
thing if manufactured as it had sent

214
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,510
an email because I dreamed in

215
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,220
my factory at war that today there would

216
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,140
be the event of this talk one thing is

217
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,779
another very nice thing they are

218
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,019
people

219
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:57,690
maybe one has to vote on the

220
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,579
pope who is not authorized here maybe one

221
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:02,680
has to  do a vote on that he

222
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,300
will not give me some software in Rome to

223
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,060
cover a pole

224
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,829
we all know and ask a question to the

225
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:13,329
public of the people vote or did I already

226
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:16,149
say notification system but just the

227
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:17,410
interesting thing that it is really a

228
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,060
collection of tools and one must

229
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,920
just learn the ones he

230
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,949
needs to him and it turns out to be a

231
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,060
very useful tool to improve

232
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,040
the efficiency of your company or

233
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,600
your job as a

234
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,399
developer but also more generally

235
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,290
of project management in general even

236
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,300
if there are more suitable tools  perhaps

237
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,579
for this thing I do just one more a

238
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:37,990
little hint in the last minute that

239
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,970
I have left when instead of undergoing tab

240
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,320
we are all used to doing the pure

241
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,120
qu  esti not this thing here that is I have a separate

242
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,040
repository with all my

243
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,290
modifications that I propose to piss

244
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,000
up to the original developer

245
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,560
manufactured instead he thinks differently and

246
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,730
in my opinion in a more

247
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,230
efficient way regiona under review

248
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,769
that is maybe me

249
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,220
or repository 11 only not  then I have

250
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,050
billions of copies of other people I have

251
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,489
only one repository which in this case is

252
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:14,720
an application repository

253
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,749
called vast books and this

254
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:21,129
person called seal made me a proposal

255
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:24,529
in which he changed my logo but this

256
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,869
proposal is not  a separate repository that

257
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:29,720
shoots me in mine of which I will merge

258
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,540
no this proposal is a patch is an

259
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,670
ethereal thing that is in the site is a div

260
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,949
I could also download it what to do

261
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:39,139
download of

262
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,089
and I see it and just a part that is here  it is

263
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:44,329
a binary because there is an image but

264
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:46,110
the prof is just

265
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,079
a kit of so it is an ethereal thing that

266
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:53,040
is there it does not bother because because svn

267
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,380
does not tolerate brunches because if why

268
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,209
mercurial  can not stand these things

269
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,950
so they have created an extra thing

270
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,930
compatible with all repository systems to

271
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,360
make sure that anyone can

272
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,000
make a modification proposal that you

273
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,430
seagate that tosi svn that sheds mercury and

274
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,320
is called this component is called

275
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,850
differential last but not

276
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,670
least  harbor master harbor master

277
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,140
a very interesting

278
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,490
continuous integration tool

279
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,630
so if I like repositories maybe

280
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,500
mine is always a small application

281
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,540
of the local public transport of Turin, it

282
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,190
goes well apart from the fact that if there

283
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,370
are boards to manage in your pocket but

284
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,320
coming back to us  to our continuous

285
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,300
integration

286
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,200
this is a repository of

287
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,790
a very simple android application and

288
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:46,320
for each comit or component that

289
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,930
tells me if this comedian broke

290
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,890
everything even less

291
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,000
we are used to these things

292
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,190
using vip abuser of tab but being alone

293
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,140
at home and really nice made to have

294
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,970
it at home without jenkins that is you don't

295
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,709
need all this stuff here but you

296
00:11:58,709 --> 00:11:59,990
can also  use external tools

297
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,610
factories scam practically everything by

298
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,279
itself there is everything sends under together in a

299
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,079
single tool thought one thing

300
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,220
probably there is therefore another

301
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,250
idiotic thing done if maybe you by chance want to

302
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,250
make sure that there are things or to

303
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,380
dampen the  tones in the development

304
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,630
you can also create memes for example by

305
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,440
creating a meme that called ad with

306
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,410
a smiley face you can automate the

307
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,010
fact that if one comments in a task by

308
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,050
writing only to then

309
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,930
the easy one appears so I swear to you if you think

310
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,010
about the functionality probably

311
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,380
torches the not  maybe it will be so

312
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,290
simple immediately to know how to use it but

313
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,350
once you learn how to use it in my opinion it

314
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,000
will make the work more efficient

315
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,019
I did not want to say more because in reality

316
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,699
fabietto will also be a talk

317
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:56,009
of stainless steel so we hope it is just a

318
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,329
flea in the ear and then  let's talk about it

319
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:58,589
better if

320
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:00,170
the topic is still

321
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,060


322
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,730
intriguing, having said that I don't know if any of my guys from the it wiki

323
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,190
with comun are already online  that we turn on for a moment to

324
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:14,610
this wonderful event that ops the

325
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,180
tweets with is an annual event

326
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,130
in short, it has been tried to do it every

327
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,560
year and puts it every year that we try to

328
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,339
do to bring together live

329
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:27,630
clearly we know very well that this cannot be

330
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,199
done  year to bring live all

331
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,699
the people who want to chat

332
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:34,410
about wiki topics so exactly like

333
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,990
linux day it is for the theme of

334
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,110
free software in Italy they tweet them with it on the

335
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,019
theme of free content and this year

336
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,209
since practically no one had the

337
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:47,339
opportunity to neither  even just thinking of

338
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:50,160
organizing every tweet with in person

339
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,410
then we tried to organize

340
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,569
ourselves and to do something completely

341
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:57,570
online so

342
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,010
please there was someone

343
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,690
and in any case it will be great

344
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,490
this year to be able to do a linux day in

345
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,890
conjunction with elite wiki with because

346
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,210
they are not topics  that necessarily

347
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,390
clash, however, often on linux day it is true

348
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,550
that we talk about topics that would

349
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,190
perhaps be more in every tweet with and vice versa

350
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,930
in short I will be better but it will be nice

351
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,330
to be able to exchange a bit and maybe by

352
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,270
mistake even go listen to themes that

353
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,940
we do not usually listen to so I

354
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,980
invite you if by chance you know people

355
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,960
wikipedian median wiki and all

356
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,060
related wiki projects to go and

357
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,070
see the program of liters who  with

358
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,550
2020 to look at the proposals and

359
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,470
send your proposal if you have an

360
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,900
interesting talk and prato they are all already

361
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,280
published even those are already all

362
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,680
published we have 16 for now and we hope

363
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,330
to get to many more for true an

364
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,980
even richer program and maybe

365
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,000
now let's talk

366
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,490
about it in the time available if

367
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,820
someone wanted to microphone hello

368
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:11,660
everyone I am proud crossbar we hear we

369
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,750
do not see you we do not see you yet

370
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:19,970
now we have now the woman precisely

371
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,870
from the historical point of view

372
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,270
she is neither the game

373
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,040
of the community in particular

374
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,660
that of the  Trentino Alto

375
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,120
Adige area to bring together the whole

376
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,150
community of wikimedia projects  it is in

377
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,170
a decisive way,

378
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,260
however, there has always been at least one

379
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,880
appointment dedicated to the open

380
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,580
community, ranging from the military.

381
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,430
creates naco throughout the Italian-speaking community.

382
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,500


383
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,510


384
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,550


385
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,200
Valerio prima italia was talking to me this year

386
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,090
point since nothing can be done

387
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,730
we had a very nice idea as

388
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,460
she was saying or to join us I am sorry

389
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:17,440


390
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,720


391
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:28,020
we have some drop outs of your line it

392
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,690
is very very good  anyway I was

393
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,340
saying

394
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,300
so this year thanks to the fact that

395
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,230
linux day is followed with the races because

396
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,540
we do not do it together and therefore established

397
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,100
we hope the peasants a good event even

398
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,790
with your contribution

399
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,040
well then if anyone has any questions

400
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,310
to ask valerio by combining both respect

401
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,160
to the topic of the factory and why

402
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,190
compared to kiwifruit qicomm then surely

403
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,720
ask you a question then I see it in chat

404
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,790
valerio riva concerns factories and for

405
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,140
d  ice I recommend to use it on https git

406
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,569
that point it or to install it then and

407
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,839
gladly

408
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,480
that is my private instance that I use

409
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,319
for my projects I

410
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,030
gladly share it to all my

411
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,430
friends and also to the associates of the italy linux

412
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,800
society so very gladly

413
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,690

414
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,280

416
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:39,150
happy to automatically login on

417
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,960
kitab if I am not mistaken anyway I am happy to

418
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,920
try in there yes yes

419
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,610
good about the conference instead

420
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,560
ask if you have any references in addition

421
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,200
to the page you are shown type  some

422
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,800
references for those who want to collaborate

423
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,990
[Music]

424
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,980
there is a group of the range

425
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,840
yes she laura that they jump anyway as

426
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,399
ferdi said we have a telegram group

427
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:17,390
that can be reached by searching on suffered

428
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,830
apart from that now I can share the

429
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,279
screen

430
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,520
however there is the duplicated telegrah group

431
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,990
where anyone can enter and we

432
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,740
organize this wonderful event together

433
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,809
that we hope it will be as

434
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,399
pleasant as possible  despite this

435
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:33,679
emergency,

436
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,049
if one searches for tweets with 2020 on

437
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:38,779
the main page, one finds the link of

438
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:41,020
the telegram group and among other things, to make

439
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,029
the manufacturer project laugh, in

440
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:46,429
which we are tracing everyone as if

441
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:48,409
they were our own software project we are

442
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:50,419
tracing the things to do for  carry

443
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:52,970
out this event in the best possible way so if

444
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,890
one sees something that does not have an

445
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,820
assignee he can assign himself and we do

446
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,000
everything together even if he already has an

447
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,580
assignee and oble to join in another

448
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,950
point of course we can better

449
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,789
exact here we are waiting for you guys the

450
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:14,299
first at the moment how many  people the

451
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:17,090
first counts the realization then in reality

452
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,890
in the organizational team it is difficult to

453
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,720
quantify it a bit because from the rear of

454
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,159
people who do not want to stay under the

455
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:24,320
big ones there are several now more or

456
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,210
less they are quite manageable sum we

457
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,630
do not contest chardin and we also say

458
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,160


459
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,860
that conversely  in the same way since in the

460
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,300
group there are people who have no

461
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,510
effectivam  I don't know what we pocket but

462
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,460
let's say the telegram group so it

463
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,680
is indeed difficult to quantify

464
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,360
this is why we are almost thirty

465
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,000
people but then we try to be

466
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,160
even more we are better is

467
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,660
in our thirties on paper there is a

468
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,980
maximum number of three that will be  present at the

469
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,570
conference

470
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,400
here more or less numerically they will be

471
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,710
like the maximum limit like that

472
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,480
of the INPS of more or less we wanted to give

473
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,970


474
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,830
ourselves these technical limits but in reality and until there are these technical limits

475
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,780
as in the talks we try to have them

476
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,340
as short as possible because  we

477
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,070
all know we have other things to do

478
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,310
jobs etc. what to do so

479
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,570
we try to keep talks and short so

480
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,030
more people can communicate topics of interest to them

481
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,630


482
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,330
and there is also to give space to more topics

483
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,160
but it is our question facts about the

484
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:38,060
number of docs  we were thinking of three

485
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,590
cracks in this area then we

486
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,850
will see but if the proposals we

487
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,170
prepare are also why you are helping me

488
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,750
to make proposals both for  r you who for the

489
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,540
tweet icon we will try to organize by

490
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,310
looking for a wanderer a post of

491
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,290
space for everyone and to vary above all

492
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,270
with the themes that is why for various

493
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,160
short talks also because we did the

494
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,710
community survey is the setting

495
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,550
that emerged think of the community requires

496
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,130
top  and the shorter duration less talks but

497
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,150
let's say richer in content

498
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,680
remember that the call for paper is

499
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:17,070
open until day 21 on average

500
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,930
eating at least 31 of July so there is

501
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,180
