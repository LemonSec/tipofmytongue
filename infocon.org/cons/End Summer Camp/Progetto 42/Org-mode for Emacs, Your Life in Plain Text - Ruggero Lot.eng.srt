1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
so i'm ruggiero who was

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,730
everyone what i do in life i'm a

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,980
doctoral student from as saint ares

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,290
toulouse not in italy anyway i live in

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,929
trieste and i'm more or less stable here

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,120
my job mainly consists in

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,430
predicting the states were i  money of

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,439
silicon and silicon surfaces

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,800
so it is far from being that of a

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,920
programmer or

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,210
what is related

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,640
but the fact that however I am in

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,460
a sector of a computational calculation

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,530
so much and the high data analysis

15
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,510
leads me to interface we begin  with the

16
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,070
world of programming very often

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,100
and therefore to develop code we are not

18
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,750
in a structural way but more in a

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,970
way based on the needs here I am part

20
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,180
of the mister what is the meter skillfully

21
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,280
reb for those who do not know it is a hacker

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,140
space where we do things  we see people it is

23
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,350
a European aspect it is a

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,149
physical place in this period it is a more

25
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:03,269
virtual than physical place where we meet and

26
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:05,470
discuss projects and development  iluppi

27
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,039
I love with the philosophy of having

28
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,560
free things for everyone in the end

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,850
learn and share and share

30
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,070
knowledge

31
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,990
we are here to talk york mod ok all

32
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,060
mode is a tip of a pyramid I wanted to

33
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,170
do the road a little better but I didn't

34
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,149
make it in time  let's say that at the base of

35
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:26,830
all this top there is max which I hope

36
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,679
we see after sip it is max we will insert

37
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:31,360
space max and on space max insert

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,799
work mode and then we will discuss

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,880
york modes very quickly

40
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,409
however the idea of the pyramid that the

41
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,380
base  and it is max and on this then we build

42
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,570
what is max ok is max everyone

43
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,040
knows it as a simple

44
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,380
simple text editor open quotes things

45
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,380
quotes but in reality it is much more

46
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,840
than all this through the extensions

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
that can be installed it becomes a

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,100
main client  news rivera a debugger a

49
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,899
calendar a psychologist a project

50
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:58,149
planner can practically become an

51
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:59,950
operating system with a lot of

52
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,500
software inside it

53
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,950
now the is max is quite compl

54
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,160
icato hiding teams that are used for

55
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,600
at least never to complicated and that

56
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,920
binding are not anything but

57
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,490
intuitive because it is a software that does not

58
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,830
have much graphical interface

59
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,860
to overcome this problem

60
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,800
for people who come from wim as a

61
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,750
corridor there are distributions  of

62
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,090
and max among these distributions we find

63
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,540
space max precisely that it is a

64
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,850
distribution that

65
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,320
basically provides all that bindings

66
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,190
of wim are reported in the world is

67
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,200
max in quotation marks all the

68
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,910
functions of are reported in the

69
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:48,410
world is max and the in addition are inserted

70
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,590
some

71
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,420
much more native me monici and consistent

72
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,830
is the one before it was

73
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,810
obviously not the space maxi logo

74
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,299
space max logo this is the one before it was

75
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,810
a fun game that can be enabled

76
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,299
in the worst of the introduction so at the

77
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:07,590
base we have a magical this text

78
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,290
editor  with lots of plugins text

79
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,280
editor with lots of plugins we

80
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,250
install space max space max c from a

81
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,500
set of that bin  ding to manage all

82
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,830
the very human plugins

83
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,290
plus the wim structure which is the one

84
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,570
with which we get used to which at least I

85
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,830
am used

86
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,420
to everything we are going to

87
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,100
discuss I will discuss in this

88
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,660
context

89
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,880
it is not the only context that is space max is

90
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,800
a distribution via max there are at

91
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,040
work there are infinite and if you want to

92
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,200
take care of your own and in addition we

93
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,850
the binding I will give are

94
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,010
only those for the most part

95
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,870
are by default of space max

96
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,819
but one can use those of is  max

97
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:52,500
that are very different the basic concepts

98
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,980
that one must know how to manage to

99
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,790
approach this context are

100
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,010
first of all what they are what the

101
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,750
structure of e max that is how

102
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,760
the files are managed within e max is

103
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,200
max is composed in bayern

104
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,959
each file that  we open creates a new

105
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,900
buffer each service we launch creates

106
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,629
a new buffer when we open a buffer

107
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,060
this is a hooker bottom line a

108
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,500
line at the bottom of the page that in the cast

109
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,728
of space max has u  similar to what we

110
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:20,060
see in this image

111
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,019
on the left action large number of

112
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,520
buffers we are looking at then after there is

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,840
the status of the buffer that can be

114
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,910
saved unsaved in this case it is

115
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,890
saved cannot be saved the

116
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,950
buffer size of the associated file the name the

117
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,320
major mode and the and some mine or mod

118
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,210
the major way basically the

119
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,140
main plugin we are using

120
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,510
inside the buffer in this case

121
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,400
heard mode however there may be mailer

122
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,380
there may be a plugin for milk that each

123
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,790
language to its plugin principles

124
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,220
there is this  operation to do that to

125
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,310
contact marco

126
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,220
and in contacting marco has a priority

127
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,840
of type a which is high

128
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,230
so we can go to define a

129
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,510
we have deadline deadline.com of

130
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,340
this inserts a dead line

131
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,370
for the action of priorities com priority

132
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,860
abc  to see the priorities the comasche

133
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,140
you're dead line

134
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,000
dave kaye johnson and this brings us to the

135
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,680
company because we have heard the

136
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,900
dates we wonder how it

137
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,990
fits  sce the agenda in all this

138
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,460
then first of all it costs to do that

139
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,360
you have to add the file to the agenda

140
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,410
as you add the file to

141
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,530
the company against the c square bracket you add

142
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,940
to make people at this point you have to

143
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,270
open the agenda control yes  sa is the

144
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,770
open agenda we are offered this

145
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,030
screen which is said to let us

146
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,090
choose between various options in

147
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,360
quotation marks a for the classic agenda t we

148
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,330
make a list

149
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,530
of all the tutus on two entries that we have

150
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,300
available at the moment the others

151
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,120
let's leave it alone they are the most sophisticated ex

152
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,650
that is the every entry to which essentially

153
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,050
an expo area on all the files that are

154
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,639
available

155
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,229
have been loaded and followed by the

156
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:17,590
agenda in this case I have elaborated a

157
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,289
little to see how it turns out

158
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:21,699
if I go to see them all  the next

159
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:24,169
actions to do that letter t

160
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,180
you see that we are shown in this

161
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,819
case the actions organized by order

162
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:32,090
by priority we have the contact marco

163
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,310
who was that of those before we

164
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,110
entered  ito first in our file

165
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,999
we have a tag for the file that the pug

166
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:40,879
that was associated first alterations that

167
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,229
are inserted below with their

168
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:47,300
respective tags and we have tutu that

169
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,800
was always open in the action

170
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,990
before that it was possible to play the

171
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,630
ranelli file  junod

172
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,620
if instead we show the program for the

173
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,810
week with a letter we can

174
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,480
open the whole program we see

175
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,610
that there is a tube let's say that for example

176
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,410
we have the meeting of this card evening

177
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,110
sky sworn at a date now then after

178
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,760
there is the tutu  to contact marco who is

179
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,770
down because it has to be done in three days

180
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,540
there is the email

181
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,890
the deadline which is for Sunday as

182
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,600
we move in this phase we move

183
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,950
in this agenda obviously the keys are

184
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,370
and jay kay out as any rhyme with

185
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,290
user yes  would wait with hulk space

186
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,030
we can open a table a table

187
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,430
with a thousand other options

188
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,560
in particular attention must be given to the

189
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,910
headlines this allows us

190
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,130
to change the status qu directly from the agenda  then

191
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,650
move a tool two to dan on next so

192
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,340
on

193
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,350
i have some that allows us to change the

194
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,110
date remove the molding team

195
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,340
schedule one thing for the future and so

196
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,050
on

197
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,099
returning to the meeting the meeting is

198
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:52,869
nothing more than a time stamp with a time stamp

199
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:55,689
in this case when I was

200
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:58,059
writing my project I

201
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:01,569
arrive at the adv to the point at the claim that

202
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:04,360
tells me where is mine that tells me where

203
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,129
is the meeting is the keyword meeting

204
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:07,449
which an extra keyword has nothing to do

205
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:08,080


206
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,699
and there more than anything else because I

207
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,199
personally I use it to remind me the

208
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,879
meeting is one ago paragraph of head for

209
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,969
gate inter time stamp the time the many

210
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:20,619
offers one day you tell him

211
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:22,300
I want it 9 pm I want it to last two hours

212
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,159
so in full plus two automatically

213
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:25,749
times dampyr  is created and this thing

214
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:28,679
is added to the agenda

215
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,970
among the last features I wanted

216
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,830
to tell you about is time tracking because

217
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,200
we can also manage our

218
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,270
how much time we spend on each pocket

219
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,010
time tracking is accessible more or less

220
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,960
everywhere  que in is max so you don't need to be

221
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,040
in a word mode file with maxi it

222
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,570
allows me to open it anyway so that

223
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,450
the simplest thing

224
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,950
is this fantastic screen

225
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,230
where you have the various timers you can click

226
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,830
in in a headline click out from a

227
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,080
headline  jumping has a clock that you have

228
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,310
active if you are used to using

229
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,200
Pomodoro timer you have the Pomodoro timer

230
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,080
integrated and in the end when you have

231
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,670
done some clock hynek lockout on some

232
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,830
actions what happens that the various

233
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,890
pockets you have will be more or less of

234
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,210
this type  they will have included this

235
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,360
logbook it is called drawer technically a

236
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,700
particular drawer where it is

237
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,810
assigned every time you have made the

238
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,580
blocks in the glok auto is assigned

239
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,860
the total time spent in the action this

240
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,420
always remains a text file so if you make a

241
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,370
mistake it would just

242
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,280
go  on the line avoid the time

243
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,920
that you have wrong comma

244
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,260
comma all times are updated

245
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,320
automatically and when you are finished  to a

246
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,860
very nice thing that you can do the

247
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,720
final report and it tells you how much you

248
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,200
spent on each section

249
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,640
and how much was the total time

250
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,410
you spent on the project

251
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,680
and

252
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,230
that's it. horwood conclusions a great piece

253
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,170
of software provides you to get organized

254
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,090
but it's up to us  deciding how to combine them

255
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,220
space max makes it intuitive for those

256
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,440
coming from wim and there is a lot more than

257
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,690
what I said among other things precisely orc

258
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,490
mode also presentations wanting us to

259
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,450
export it to beemer thanks

260
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,550
we had some software latex mime which

261
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,260
is a software  to make screenshot pdf

262
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,520
cpc to present pdf made in beemer

263
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,310
and some references for those interested

264
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,760
these

265
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,400
realities are links so and I finished

266
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,280
15 seconds early

267
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,820
well then on hear and ruggiero

268
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,560
because he had to make a change of

269
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,520
nurseries  except I feel very well then I

270
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,830
thank you as they say you were

271
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,870
one of those players who split the

272
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,710
second

273
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,550
or rather unpacking and in the meantime, however,

274
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,450
these were the in  interpretation as

275
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,490
we are now used to hearing on

276
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,400
our Thursdays at this point not

277
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,110
as usual there is space for the questions

278
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,450
that you answer so I look for a moment in

279
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,490
chat if any of the questions to

280
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,290
ask can be asked through our own

281
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,900
of the stracciati di  terna or

282
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,700
the legrand group or remove the

283
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,180
mood and enter directly into the

284
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,689
conference

285
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,840
now I here from the device cannot

286
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,650
read the questions, however, so I don't know

287
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,880
if there are questions to rediscover the chat

288
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,610
for now only the one

289
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,860
ok no then the beautiful ciato  it seems that

290
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,630
there is no question if if you are not

291
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,590
normally I make it a hero who was and

292
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,190
representations reality he did it

293
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,650
directly in beemer the question is

294
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,120
how the presentation was made

295
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,130
is a gamer

296
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,170
because it is true that jorge mode is comfortable for

297
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,630
then do the outline you do it nord mode

298
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,180
the notes I took them all nord mod

299
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,800
but then the end used beemer because

300
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,760
let's say that personally I work a

301
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,820
lot more on it and  so I am much more

302
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,080
immediate and it is much more immediate for me to

303
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,310
make presentations beemer moreover the

304
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,550
amount of customization that can be

305
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,710
obtained by exporting dormo from beemer is

306
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:39,270
very constrained by the pre-

307
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,890
built formats that they

308
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,810
impose on you in that case

309
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,890
ok I replied then it was

310
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:58,380
max's question so now our technician is what

311
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,170
you can do ficili and I'll

312
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,630
ask you a question me you this amorous software a

313
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,560
long time me the first time I

314
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,980
would marry mode was

315
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,920
a year ago now a year and a half ago and I just

316
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,389
started using it  to

317
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:19,940
manage outline ok so in a

318
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,709
very banal way with how I did

319
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:23,690
at the beginning to take some notes,

320
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,630
little things like that and then later I slowly

321
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,760
discovered the other functions and I

322
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,500
expanded a bit I began to manage the

323
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,769
voodoo slowly and to  today they use a

324
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:37,670
lot of youtube outlines the link

325
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,540
file with other files the link is such a big

326
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,709
thing to be able to

327
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:44,660
manage me in large projects

328
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,220
where there are so many files that keep

329
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,400
different notes of different things

330
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,160
the diary I don't use it a lot in reality I

331
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,050
use the tour a lot to know what is

332
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,700
next but I don't use

333
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,470
the diary itself a lot as an organizing tool

334
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,560


335
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,400
ok

336
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:21,360
if the question I take question but I

337
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,210
have not understood very well what it is I am

338
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,020
fine

339
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,810
for several things but he seems to flow

340
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,740
of the features that spend

341
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,100
existence

342
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:39,440
you give me with richer with inter than a

343
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,640
rich to take notes in all

344
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,560
respects is a  set of scripts that

345
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,560
act on text files is a

346
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,120
collection of scripts with speech

347
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,900
text files the end of the day how

348
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,230
after you combine these vip to get the

349
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,660
best result for itself is another matter

350
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,470
if I can try milling

351
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,570
again also another way to  to see it is

352
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,940
that horwood was born as a wrapper

353
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,950
around a library of outlines default

354
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,250
was born only to manage outlines this

355
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,010
was its main goal

356
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,540
then after these outlines like hotlines

357
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,010
they lend themselves very well to the management of

358
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,170
tutu the whole

359
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,650
part of gaza james has been developed from another

360
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,920
quotation mark which is the work philosophy

361
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,820
added all these scripts that

362
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,910
allow you to organize your

363
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,160
life but let's say that the basic

364
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,800
idea is  that you do not require a way to

365
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,380
organize yourself that is there are ok if you feel

366
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,070
comfortable with these scripts and they are for you or

367
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,810
rearrange them to get the most out of

368
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,250
your work it is okay if not you do not use them ok

369
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,660
so it is not just a thing in

370
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,040
format and also  an

371
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,190
interface function is also a question of

372
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,110
wall street what
