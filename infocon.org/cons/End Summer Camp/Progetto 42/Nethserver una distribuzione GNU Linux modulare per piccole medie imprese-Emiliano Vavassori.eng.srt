1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,210
then I will start very briefly with

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,250
a small presentation mostly

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,500
to focus on some

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,679
particular aspect of the distribution but then

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,120
let's say that the bulk of my

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,320
presentation

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,090
I would like maybe a live demo so

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,430
let you actually see what it

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,750
means to work with this distribution

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,539
let you see more or less  what are the

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,789
possibilities we will see some unfortunately we will not be

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,220
able to see them all but maybe

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,630
I will focus on some

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,300
rather interesting details then

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,989
first of all just a moment that I

16
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,640
manage a little better with the

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,270
presentation what is in the servers

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,040
first of all in the server and a

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,379
distribution based on 100 s  so

20
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,980
i guess i presume that most of us

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,399
already know what 100 is

22
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,329
if so let's say that based on this

23
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,340
particular operating system version

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,079
there is a whole series of considerations to

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,049
make the fact that it started was

26
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,790
initially supported by herat and

27
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,070
so on are  being a community is

28
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,650
a free being  eng with a

29
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,390
very wide support for both hardware and

30
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,150
software and therefore being based on

31
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,619
this distribution certainly a

32
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,229
very advantageous point is a

33
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,900
community distribution however there

34
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,909
are people who work there from

35
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,650
anywhere in the world from

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,490
latin america from america arises  so

37
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,820
actually there is a

38
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,939
very savannah and variegated community then there will be

39
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,619
during the last slide that I will then

40
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,640
propose there are references to the

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,009
community so you will then

42
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,890
be able to look at it as I anticipated enrico

43
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,600
it is a distribution that was

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
initially developed  and that is

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,110
continually supported by an Italian company

46
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,460


47
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,930
I will not say the name but it is quite

48
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,409
simple you can understand what this

49
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:02,909
company is

50
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,470
personally a group of very

51
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,788
smart people with very clear ideas and

52
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,340
therefore we say that often and

53
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,440
gladly also have to deal with it directly in

54
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,540
person  maybe happen to see them at the stage

55
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,940
very often is always one of the

56
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,170
experiences

57
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,489
one of the asp  positive effects of the

58
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,440
distribution which is much easier to

59
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,810
use as you can imagine then

60
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,040
we will see for a moment what it means to

61
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,870
a whole series of modules so based

62
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,090
on our needs we can more or

63
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,600
less make them do what we want is

64
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
a development feature that

65
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,820
they are carrying on guys from this

66
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,290
company but not even the community is

67
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,230
to rely as much as possible on packets

68
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,239
that come from streams

69
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:51,160
if there is any bug or problem

70
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,380
with upstream packets the

71
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,930
classic upstream bug is done and

72
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,880
bayern streaming is solved  so from this

73
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,310
point of view the contribution also to

74
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,160
the 100 s project is more than guaranteed

75
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,320
because we should use in the server what

76
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,209
are the characteristics that

77
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:11,980
make this distribution a bit special

78
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,690


79
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,930
surely there is an intermediate

80
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,329
management layer called e smith that

81
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,799
it actually comes from another

82
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,079
chesney server distribution which is

83
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,049
made up of event template database then

84
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:28,090
we'll see  what does it mean specifically

85
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,579
there is a specific slide for the others not

86
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,609
the very interesting thing instead is that it

87
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:37,230
is equipped with a comfortable web interface

88
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,430
quite renewed based on a

89
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,750
communicating process called

90
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,910
cockpit to a focus on small

91
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,640
and medium-sized companies so if  you need a

92
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,489
small dressing room a company rather

93
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,489
than interesting solutions can

94
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:56,410
also make us some interesting stuff at

95
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,489
the cloud level

96
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,709
let's say this is the

97
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,500
fundamental focus of distribution

98
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,600
the fundamental concept finger for

99
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,640
distribution that

100
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,460
we can potentially upload on a single server  many

101
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,440
services that must therefore

102
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,920
be sufficient to keep the company going

103
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,779
so also in this case we go to

104
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,190
deepen the concept of multi

105
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,140
purpose and therefore I

106
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,690
can have several different functions on the same server

107
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,690
another very very interesting thing is

108
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,240
that it offers the service  of

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,460
obviously compatible active directory must be given

110
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,690
on samba 4

111
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,790
by a pa  rte very interesting I

112
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,840
personally have some customers

113
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,160
with whom we use it we are

114
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,350
very well it is completely

115
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,140
integrable with a directory you can

116
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,870
also use the management tools born alive

117
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,810
active directory on this context which is

118
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,600
definitely an interesting solution and

119
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,360
obviously in the community version but

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,610
also  in the real version of this

121
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:05,010
company then with support with

122
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,450
what is called subscription then

123
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,010
I hope to be able to store this

124
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,550
topic too

125
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,710
clearly it's all for source

126
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,270
ok I did not believe among other things a question

127
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,220
what does upstream mean I will close it in a

128
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,909
minute since  between that we

129
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:32,460
go upstream simply means to

130
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,250
report based on what comes from

131
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,110
which it derives so in the case of in the

132
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,550
server it derives from 100 s then it is based on

133
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,860
all software based on 100

134
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,620
if then proceeds from them we see if I can

135
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,490
go ahead

136
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,469
the last step that was missing from this

137
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:52,870
slide that simply all their

138
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,099
s  oftware open source and therefore based

139
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,400
on these then we will see a next link

140
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,590
in the next slides where to find the

141
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,139
software I wanted to say a few words about and

142
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,690
smith since from the second round maybe

143
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,340
I can do it in the least time any

144
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,469
changes we make to the system are

145
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:16,060
not processed  directly

146
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,460
within the configuration files

147
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,110
of the system itself

148
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,789
but what happens is that through the

149
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:23,710
commands we use or

150
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,529
the browser interface

151
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:28,000
we write a database and textual

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,889
within the system in which

153
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,419
our particular

154
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:35,169
configurations are saved the information taken  from

155
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:38,110
this database with the templates that are

156
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,529
clearly file-based templates

157
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:43,630
and resulting in these that are called

158
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,840
events that are nothing more than a

159
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,819
series of writings followed in a certain

160
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:52,419
order configure our system and

161
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:53,889
allow you to have the

162
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,169
configuration files to their  place

163
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:58,750
and services in a consistent state

164
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,180
the interesting thing about everything

165
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,690
I don't have  said is that in reality since

166
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,039
our configuration information

167
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:08,590
is part of a database

168
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,969
if the configuration files are damaged

169
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:13,060
we can trigger an

170
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,909
event which is what then puts

171
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:17,229
our service back in the conditions to

172
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:21,009
start and therefore we can have

173
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,139
ours our machine  restarted from

174
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,000
a position is known and has a functional position

175
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,210


176
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,800
last slide in which I leave you the

177
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,840
references of the project which are

178
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,650
trivially the official site the site

179
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,450
of the international community there

180
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,000
is official documentation available in

181
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,460
English and Italian since

182
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,530
the company that  rightly he

183
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,250
initially produced the software and as an Italian

184
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,270
there is a wiki that has been implemented

185
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,730
with all the contributions the anatomy of

186
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,630
canvases in which there are cars rather than

187
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,560
tricks rather than even

188
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,860
some of the participants in the community

189
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,440
have their repositories the

190
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,450
open code  source clearly available

191
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,220
immediately so you can go and browse

192
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,310
what what it does how it works and anything else

193
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,860
you can directly contact

194
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,780
the developers there and then clearly there is

195
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,639
a developer manual

196
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,350
in this case there is mainly in

197
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,139
English but it is very interesting to

198
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:25,830
see a whole series of information

199
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,229
for the development I would say  that at this point

200
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:32,289
of the presentation we could not do

201
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:32,950
anything more

202
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,809
but let's see I can show

203
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,950
something actually operational

204
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,299
this is the graphical interface of

205
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,900
ours in the server in particular as I

206
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,180
mentioned before the web interface is

207
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,120
based on another

208
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,370
community project  which is called cockpit

209
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,960
pio I log in to the machine for

210
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,310
one hundred machine to have the one for a

211
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,620
virtual machine that I created on

212
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,890
my pc and you see that immediately a number of

213
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,380
clearly having made some

214
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,810
changes with the zoom the proportions are then

215
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,170
not respected  fine but the

216
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,230
functionality is all me between the

217
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,850
possibility of seeing some

218
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,040
nice information of my

219
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,290
system  ema with the graphs I repeat I know that

220
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,310
load I can even attribute

221
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,430
my installation to a

222
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,190
specific company I didn't say it sorry but

223
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,440
the installation is down iso that can be

224
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,209
downloaded directly from their site and is

225
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:37,120
practically identical to 100 s so  I

226
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,600
preferred to use my

227
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,120
time a little more productive way

228
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,240
from here I can at this point

229
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,850
check all the settings of

230
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,980
my system for example I could decide

231
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,800
to change the ip address in my

232
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,990
machine I don't want it to be in dhcp but

233
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,940
for example I want it to have  a

234
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,820
static ip address and then you understand that

235
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,680
I could magnify then I do not

236
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,310
do it for reasons of not breaking

237
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,800
the presentation in full but here is the

238
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,320
basic concept this I can add

239
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,970
dns records because

240
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,910
dns masca is born on the machine so I can already

241
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,270
use the  hcp and dns configured by the

242
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,740
server or the possibility of restarting

243
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,910
the various services

244
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,220
installed on the machine quite comfortably always everything

245
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,930
for one  '' very comfortable web interface

246
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,380
or even the ability to set

247
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,540
some very interesting little things

248
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,730
change the root password

249
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,720
enable two-factor authentication for ruth

250
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,860
configure a smartphone for

251
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,020
sending mail configure the destination

252
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,050
between defined for sending notifications

253
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,060
there are  also some beautiful things

254
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,430
especially this page if I

255
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,170
believe different users on the system

256
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,090
can enable this part here and

257
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,160
allow users to change their

258
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,860
password starting from a site installed

259
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,780
on this very

260
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,530
convenient machine is very interesting

261
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,270
just to proceed for a moment there  I

262
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,160
show one of the parts which is the

263
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,280
fundamental ones of the server which is the software

264
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,930
center which is a place where we can

265
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,940
check what we can install

266
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,340
of this in the servers so from this

267
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,590
point of view here I am notified

268
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,020
despite having made the updates

269
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,040
yesterday that c  'is a new update

270
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,040
available you see it comes anyway  and

271
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,390
from the packages of 100 s wanted to

272
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,100
update my distribution every

273
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,480
day there is also the possibility

274
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,790
to precisely configure in which

275
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,510
mode but then configure the server

276
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,040
that is I want

277
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,960
all updates to be downloaded installed have

278
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,990
the same moment in which they are available

279
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,820
what else can you do with servers b

280
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,710
this that these that you see that I

281
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,710
hope slowly are all the

282
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,570
things that you can install

283
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,790
directly on the net server with a click

284
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,740
let's make an example so that we

285
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,130
realize for example we

286
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,110
install the role  of the

287
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,880
basic firewall and install the fail to ban role

288
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,990
see video I select the two

289
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,940
possibilities or even the possibility, among

290
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,220
other things, to search within the

291
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,560
software packages or rather the

292
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,260
applications that have been predefined

293
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,680
when I tell them install it

294
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,480
is definitely unfair to uninstall

295
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,769
you see that it

296
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,439
generates a whole series of operations between

297
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:42,600
cure and download related packets

298
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,980
failed pe  r because you are clearly

299
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,100
in the installation time should at

300
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,309
this point directly update

301
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:54,959
our web interface with the

302
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,360
new features that we have tested is

303
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,739
installed here it is we have

304
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,420
installed new features

305
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,980
both applications that had

306
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,179
installed appear under

307
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:09,620
applications that they call

308
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,260
firewall is that  called failed to ban

309
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,030
there is one and already default web server

310
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,520
that you need it worth you want to install it

311
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,950
already has on board clearly as doing a

312
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,770
web server and you can use it to make us for

313
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,580
example the configuration of websites and

314
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,210
anything else

315
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,960
I wanted to show you in  reality both the

316
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,880
firework part and the ferento ban part

317
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,860
you see that there is always the possibility to

318
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,510
add some [ __ ] on the left for

319
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,840
what is the application we

320
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,910
are looking at

321
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,490
we see the firewall part for the

322
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,410
patron firewall part and  it might

323
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,710
be interesting to generate a new

324
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,530
interface to a red logical interface

325
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,910


326
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,310
and then with  holds in itself is this

327
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,120
designation in colors

328
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,800
we say the trust we place in

329
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,330
this network interface we

330
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,300
pretend that we have a

331
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,099
red wlan based interface on the

332
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,690
publicly physical inter that

333
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,010
we

334
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,020
give cup addressing it is not a

335
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,230
problem

336
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,510
10001 so much not  he never 5

337
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,079
that we give him national only I do

338
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,410
that the system thinks about it for a moment and

339
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,740
generates our red interface

340
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,529
that I can then directly

341
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,240
use within the

342
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,630
firewall rules I am afraid he could not

343
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,680
show the active directory

344
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,770
unfortunately at this point  at least

345
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,720
part of this thing here then we go back

346
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,209
to the software center and show

347
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:56,649
what else can be done so in this

348
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:58,660
case we have a red interface and

349
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,510
a green interface which is the one that

350
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,220
represents the lan and therefore at this

351
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,649
point at the firewall level  we can

352
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:08,950
decide for example to open doors with

353
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,670
the forum and in this case at this point

354
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,029
he tells us I want a Filipino door

355
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:19,450
to open  port 80 on the host for

356
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,839
example just written a vaccata 2

357
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,180
part cialma it is with this operation here

358
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,940
I have created my firewall rule and

359
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,620
I can directly apply it on the

360
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,270
firewall clearly this double

361
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,610
application pass also implies

362
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,100
that I can create n firewall rules

363
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,180
and apply them all at the same time

364
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,760
[Music]

365
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,800
sorry pink ask yourself I would put a minute

366
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,089
please who ok

367
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:53,320
the other thing they wanted to show

368
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,790
something at this point I would say that

369
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,550
we could almost have reached the end

370
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,180
of time is that by installing the role of

371
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,990
shantou ban

372
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,110
I have fake banks  a process that more or

373
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,459
less I hope you all know

374
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:09,190
is a process that serves to ban

375
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,430
any attempts of intrusion or

376
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,660
attempts to brutally force passwords

377
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,060
on all these services you already see

378
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,450
natively lecce its

379
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,990
wide protection on all the basic services you

380
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,310
have installed is still to be  this

381
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,050
interface I can directly

382
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,910
disband people who for example

383
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,329
source b  years from feltman rather

384
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,480
than putting the ping white list notify

385
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,000
by email if someone arrives and is

386
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,100
banned are a whole series of

387
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,050
settings this for example I wanted to

388
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,510
show you why actually the

389
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,209
product is

390
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:53,999
a community work initially and

391
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:57,360
then and then at this point at this

392
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,589
point  of view

393
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:00,329
you also have the possibility to activate or

394
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:02,279
deactivate the individual jennifer tuban

395
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,510
there is the possibility to see the logo

396
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,099
directly from the server what happened

397
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,740
what are the laws that have been activated

398
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,329
as well as there is also for the system to

399
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,099
put it

400
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,510
all aside  of lobby system you can decide

401
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,510
which one to see at which date facebook

402
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,760
for which service you want to go to

403
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,319
see the longs and so on

404
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,059
unfortunately I expected to be able to

405
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,590
show you something more but I would say that

406
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,620
we are almost running out I

407
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,419
prefer to show you something more

408
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,809
maybe  stimulated by the questions with

409
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,880
the last thing I would like to show me is

410
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,669
that directly from this interface  ia

411
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:46,559
based on the cockpit

412
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,320
if you need you can launch

413
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,679
beautiful townships and then at this

414
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,020
point for example since

415
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,809
we had an update in the queue that

416
00:17:57,809 --> 00:17:58,620
we did not do

417
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,220
we can for example decide to

418
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,559
actually launch it and then

419
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,480
our machine will then proceed to do the

420
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,390
operations  that we will clearly tell him in

421
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,220
a technical way and on a console

422
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,650
I had other programs but we will not stay

423
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,820
in them so in this specific case

424
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,660
I would say that we can already proceed to the

425
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,520
questions if there is any use case that

426
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:32,220
we want to see well are

427
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,910
questions in  chat but basically anyway

428
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,370
I remember you can ask a question an

429
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,110
internal chat or in the telegram group

430
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,730
or remove minutes the inter vira

431
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,300
terms directly in the appreciate

432
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,690
then we have a question says you can

433
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,460
explain in the web part reverse proxy

434
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,460
maybe she certainly did yes

435
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,410
no not there  'i did wrong i show it

436
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,480
clearly in the applications

437
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,060
part there is a web server part can an  give

438
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,980
in the settings in this web

439
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,560
server again in the intermediate menu there is a

440
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:13,860
part of reverse proxy and by creating a

441
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,600
reverse proxy clearly I have

442
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,120
to name my application which is

443
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,020
actually the resource that is then

444
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,200
actually crossed for example I

445
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,270
do not know it could  being a cloud to

446
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,490
mussolini

447
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,840
screams of destination i.e. which one

448
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,780
actually parked here I then have to

449
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,050
make him look for example what I know or

450
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,250
an internal application as long as I

451
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,270
can write a description on the books 3

452
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,130
that is random for me

453
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,850
then the real

454
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,950
but  I can configure a lot of other stuff

455
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,230
for which for example they can limit

456
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,289
the access for a sponge for a list

457
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:09,100
of cyber networks I can decide to upload

458
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,720
a specific certificate between two minus

459
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,030
this we see it later clearly

460
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,429
I have not shown it but we cannot

461
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:20,169
announce in a manner  very fast in the

462
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:23,230
part of sorry certificates

463
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,910
within true venice it is possible to directly

464
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,860
request a sand creek certificate

465
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,280
the system asks you for which domain and in

466
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,140
any case for which addresses you want to

467
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,059
ask for there are also here in the

468
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:35,740
advanced options for example the notification email

469
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,140
when you make the request and if your

470
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,659
machine correctly exposed has the

471
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:43,840
name of our resolved you can get a

472
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,260
certificate that  at this point you can

473
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,500
go to use in the part where

474
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,630
we had left the reverse proxy in

475
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,770
the certificate part so the thing is

476
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,389
very interesting you see that

477
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,120
it is not said that it will be true that

478
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,190
hosted behind needs the

479
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:10,920
certificate because it can also

480
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,800
terminate on the reverse proxy certified

481
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,880
by the  front part if you

482
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,700
expose it in https necessarily need

483
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,580
and at that point you do it at the

484
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,610
border server things become a little more

485
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,360
complicated if you see that here there is

486
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,870
a flag that says ok the back end and

487
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:40,080
requires an ssl connection

488
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,760
so let's say that  this is the basis

489
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,530
clearly they too have not

490
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,870
necessarily foreseen all the cases

491
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,100
there is or difficult  to be foreseen however for

492
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,780
example we make a real example

493
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,030
from the research that we use

494
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,720
daily

495
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,440
excellent documentation produced by

496
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,679
these gentlemen both in English and

497
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,900
actually in Italian for the most

498
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,450
complex cases they give them a template already

499
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,480
destruction to put with a whole

500
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,470
series  of instructions and show you how it

501
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,970
works to get to

502
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,150
Enrico's question it would be a bit difficult to

503
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,620
compete so during the

504
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,550
presentation usually when we play some services

505
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,140
that were behind the three clips we also

506
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,620
use the manual procedure so we

507
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,000
configure

508
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,480
the reverse proxy configuration file  by hand we say that

509
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,460
for normal services

510
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,250
this thing here should be more than enough answers

511
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,480
to another question that I have seen pass

512
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,360
as it integrates with docker then I leave the

513
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,340
word and God forbid it has been

514
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,920
released quite recently the

515
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,290
part of local also here is  was

516
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:04,010
released in the community part

517
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,050
there are a whole series of instructions

518
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,750
and at that  point once you follow

519
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,809
these instructions to activate them there is the

520
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:13,780
management part of containing

521
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,610
objectively activate these contain

522
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,850
and use them as you wish

523
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:22,280
I would say that I believe that the

524
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,650
deadline of the presentation has occurred

525
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,450
unfortunately thank you very much if you have any questions I

526
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,930
am available

527
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,240
yes of  basic add a question I

528
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,870
know there is a community behind in the server

529
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,580
now and I guess you are participating in

530
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,910
this community not as often as

531
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,570
I would like but you like paper I participate

532
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,970
so we are in areas of references for

533
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,480
those who want to take an interest in going  to

534
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,360
participate

535
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,570
then the community site and

536
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,980
what I wrote in the slides

537
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,320
but I will show it to you immediately is a

538
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,860
beautiful forum in question you can

539
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,840
subscribe there are all the applications

540
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,500
to be able to follow it I will show you I do not

541
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,970
know if I can show me the

542
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,740
screams but  if you go to the official

543
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,150
net server site

544
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,990
let's do it like this we do with the

545
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,880
dot org servers

546
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,530
inside the yes  to official the

547
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,660
community is connected too at the top there is

548
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,070
a beautiful button here in china

549
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,840
community when they click you go

550
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,610
directly to the forum I

551
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,590
repeat talk to all the

552
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,929
people involved in development from those

553
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:37,520
side on the real movie

554
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,380
developers inside the  '

555
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,169
Italian company certainly an excellent opportunity

556
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:43,040
for growth

557
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,020
we remind you precisely from one

558
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,820
of the Italian ones and therefore this is also

559
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,660
a strong point.

560
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,590


561
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,919


562
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,580


563
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,210


564
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,559
some other question or in

565
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,820
any case how to find you then they are a bit

566
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,040
everywhere they are on telegram with

567
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,030
let's see if they can see

568
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,870
somewhere I have my references but

569
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,309
we do it that leaves them in chat

570
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:20,630
because otherwise it is long and therefore at least I

571
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,309
do not see any more time at the  next discussion

572
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:23,940


573
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,460
very well then thank you very much to

574
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,539
