1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
on twitter then i said i hope

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,640
you feel good because unfortunately my

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,560
connection tonight a little dancer

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,110
and from the co coordinator of the group

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,540
cut to denis I am talking about a

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,990
very famous bookstore for users

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,880
saw that I do not know

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,699
roughly what it is  the average is

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,590
knowing the other language

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,739
of the scripting village for all uses

11
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,820
as it allows me it is very convenient both to

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,420
automate the hermitage one does it writes

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,000
automation on the browser but also on the

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,510
systems an integral applications very

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,020
comfortable and it was born as a

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,510
scripting language  then over time it has

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,210
evolved and being the huge version 38

18
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,810
that version 2 something never

19
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,990
abandoned since

20
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,600
it is a scripting language is not particularly performing and also

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,939
has had great success in the world

22
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,670
of scientific processing for the

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,450
simplicity of the language

24
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,610
substantially but also thanks  to the fact

25
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,880
that there are libraries that increase

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,450
their strength because they are written in c is the

27
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,479
non-bind  ing python therefore you can no longer

28
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,549
use the interpreter directly

29
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,240
but you must use the miis

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,040
compiled in c for your machine

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,700
is the basis of all the libraries or in

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,510
most of the libraries for

33
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,100
data processing in basically it

34
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,800
is if  can you hear me

35
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,740
ok maybe beating the space theca

36
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,900
toscana I was telling you May a brief

37
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,300
excursus of the quick structures that

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,240
obviously range from the variables that

39
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,970
are typed but you do not need to declare

40
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,060
the type in this case you see the

41
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,620
classic character strings

42
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,820
the cambonino conversions can be

43
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,590
like this the  conversion of the interior of the

44
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,240
string

45
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:40,640
and the numbers if we try to add a

46
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,430
string with a number an error comes out

47
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,830
this for just to frame

48
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:53,980
the language there are various types of

49
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,110
primitives and languages because already

50
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,360
available to the groupings

51
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,090
one above all is the protection that  is a

52
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,410
set of variables that can be

53
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,420
any title the interior and by the

54
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,519
characteristic characteristics of  not

55
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,260
be modified and therefore slightly

56
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,100
more performing in this case in this

57
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,019
example that I have done you can see the

58
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,290
definition of the very simple function

59
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,940
in a language that does nothing but

60
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,620
take the parameters of a meta input

61
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,420
to foil a scam through these

62
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,350
outermost brackets and nothing

63
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,820
modify some values that

64
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,000
you can see the result below on the other

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,670
and calling the function trivially exits the

66
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,519
whole troop and therefore this is very

67
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,560
very convenient in the language and the

68
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,950
possibility of being able to return

69
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,030
a data delegation without having to

70
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,500
create a structure class  appropriate the

71
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,989
most used structure ever only the

72
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,810
lists in the states are editable

73
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,180
with respect to all the ordinates also of

74
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,080
everything I am the interesting thing is that

75
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,590
it is to deduce that the lists are

76
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,269
indexable first random access

77
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,940
in this case you can also

78
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,150
set the values but not  fear

79
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:29,690
red we mean in equal action in the

80
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,280
mystery they can be very much

81
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,680
composed of heterogeneous elements of dreams

82
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,200
too good rule is the name mixing

83
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,930
the types too much but as you can see

84
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,080
creating a list of tuples in this case

85
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,770
really very simple so mind a

86
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,690
result only name of that one collection

87
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,139
because I requested dedication which is

88
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:57,330
this here

89
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,120
ok  indexes in python are very

90
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,669
flexible for example there is the

91
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,389
possibility of sinning the last element

92
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:10,050
simply by putting in fact

93
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,960
the last movement of the head comes out another

94
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,979
thing is this we will see who weimin and in-

95
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,780
depth of the short a couple will take

96
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,719
very well and the smile singh  that is the

97
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:26,990
possibility of a list

98
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,419
from index 1 including instead three

99
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:34,560
excluding the result is therefore the

100
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,150
last two elements in this case

101
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,069
as the difference between those who initiate

102
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:43,620
lario who are also called Mars in

103
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,849
other places are created then we have

104
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,279
seen  the round brackets to clear

105
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,969
the square with the lists the

106
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:56,129
traditional braces dictionaries are practically

107
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:58,650
of key value  re you define a key

108
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,210
is a value

109
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,860
the keys of now sitting in the same

110
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,810
type in this case the program of

111
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,520
sterile and retrieving data is very simple

112
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,719
just always use the concept of index

113
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:18,300
then put the

114
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,279
strings in square brackets in this case the value that I

115
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,229
practice and  also to mark it is very

116
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:24,690
simple because assigned auto sales

117
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,680
if there is no 44 creates the key and there is

118
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,669
queen coeli

119
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:36,330
in this case the items command is used

120
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,619
to get all the contents of the

121
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:41,339
dictionary

122
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,899
the interesting thing is that itunes and

123
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:44,969
return to the list  of topless as

124
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,789
we have seen before therefore always and

125
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:56,929
always this use the arrays

126
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:59,489
exist are still considered

127
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:01,979
inside of father but no

128
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,059
particular meaning their styles

129
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:08,300
meaning is a list as a

130
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,610
homogeneous method of from here and are practically

131
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,490
only the numerical data yes  they can put

132
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,860
this kind of vectors are

133
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,349
optimized in the sense that for those

134
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:23,339
accustomed to classical languages they are in

135
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,759
memory of  consecutive memory cells

136
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,899
therefore performed

137
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,539
much better even if a little more

138
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,589
destructive as regards the fact

139
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:38,849
that they must only be of the type in this

140
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,860
case all the technicians present

141
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,309
beautiful star sensations for this to use them

142
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:48,419
language need Romentino in the

143
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,550
sense that damage to  indicate that

144
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,999
we would like to use the module from the module while

145
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:56,309
all the other syntaxes but this first

146
00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:01,079
are native not only do the digits the

147
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,619
arrays always respect the conviction

148
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:06,899
of the indices they have the possibility of

149
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:08,759
doing it pending that you can also find this

150
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,169
in the lists but you have to wait for the

151
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:14,160
type

152
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,920
[Music  ]

153
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:25,160
bene by dongpi and senato and is an

154
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,160
open source project released under the

155
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,070
bsd 3 license and essentially serves as a basis

156
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,340
for all other libraries including

157
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:43,280
those to split rne into even those

158
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,330
of graphics I had inter type

159
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,250
for processing the computer vision and

160
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:56,990
the invalid because he is very famous

161
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,420
because they thought about it very very well

162
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,240
that is, they decided to i  implement a

163
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,600
series of functions are many related

164
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,460
only to the vector

165
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,460
matrix calculation so that then

166
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,140
anyone could reconstruct something

167
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,800
so you don't go you will not always

168
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,190
use it directly but

169
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,100
often other libraries that exist are under power.

170

program called pip run from the

standard belief not pie always comes as a

185
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,270
single array but it does not convince me badly and

186
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,580
defined me precisely by quoting

187
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,270
the module  in this case to the ajax np

188
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,930
the array function say it and it depends if you

189
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,120
want three 20 years  10 but essentially

190
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,240
this here is the one more the as you see it

191
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,620
creates an array badly a daughter of

192
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,600
data of the same type aa of the functions

193
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,970
you will often find it is the function al and

194
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,030
inge that creates a range and then creates them

195
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,420
the same saying I say but from  1 to 6

196
00:10:52,420 --> 00:11:00,600
I exclude if this is interesting because

197
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,710
we can break it down so it seems a bit in

198
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,010
the mentality of the library to hang

199
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,860
creates an array of five elements

200
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,900
starting from zero arriving at 4

201
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:26,080
then the 5 excluded however if I do not know if

202
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:33,430
I am one that to each element  rino

203

dorio metric scale so the readers

204
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,120
burn ok and I said a property that

205

Friday given a lot of ultra combo give

206

the fact that trees have the

207
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,230
ability what a

208
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,300
normal scalar is added to add to each

209
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,810
element those values is valid for all

operations

211
00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:02,950
I think  that here you can also do this

212
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,500
thing called betto realization

213
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,520
and it is the printing force and that is to

214
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,390
avoid writing cycles in cycles chorus cycles

215
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:18,130
why invalid which is slow s  only when you

216
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,300
want to project poletto of language

217
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,150
this avoids passing

218
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,300
fighter cycles it goes directly to

length in this case added this

five elements of the value 1.0 and it is

229
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,120
quite short in the sense that

230
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,340
we have now seen before remo vector of

look it is a Sunday of two unpublished and

dimensions polyamides the accounts must

239
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,980
be done  well in the sense that if

240
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:51,910
you put a random number 60 here if I was

241
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,610
putting myself that it has nothing to do with that you

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,510
cannot recreate the choice in  image

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,160
but matrix also many reductions

244
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,689
corrected starting from the facts that we have

245
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,450
the indices not by are very important

246
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,480
because when you start to see even

247
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,140
millions of data you managed to get out

248
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,040
so for our example that has a

249
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,080
vector it is a three-dimensional matrix

[Music  ]

251
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,740
trivially putting the zero I extract the

252
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,610
first dimension and then we have these

253
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:36,250
rai vertices to understand it is done so it

254
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,440
is however only garlando the first element

255
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,390
to take the next

256
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:47,700
dimensions is not put back here the nagra

257

fame this syntax is used with the

258
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,590
comma this important  for me

259
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,640
then it starts a bit what is a bit strange and then

260
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,250
we took this it came here and

261
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,230
obviously it can reach the

262
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:11,700
maximum size making mistakes in making the

263
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,000
choices it takes of the minds is

on the agenda

265
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,350
another interesting thing that yes  can

266
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,990
do with indexes is to

267
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,460
address an array so here I have the

268
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,740
range that goes from that this because it saw

269
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,630
a commen  to this

270
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,550
the index 135 back of the minds and the

271
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,520
position 1 3 and 5

272
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,080
then I use a list as practically

273
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,540
a set of indices in I am going to take

274
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,090
values this interesting

275
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,860
basically the functioning of

276
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,650
those that diplomat 1 called the ex

277
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:59,070
suffers but nice stuff the

278
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,740
This is a small example here, that is, I can create

279
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,550
combinations of interests of the colors between

280
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,850
united the choices through indexes

281
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:14,280
and structured ones and to create scandal from

282
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,380
these combinations were of the vector

283
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,560
of the particular as this in my opinion is

284
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,890
an example maria at least peter a little

285
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,500
published but gives  the idea of how

286
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,740
powerful the library is as a

287
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,450
basic tutorial if anything you typically end up

288
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,860
with masks

289
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,860
the masks here for a vector maybe on the

290
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:58,930
way we see this vector of ours you

291
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,130
can generate boolean masks

292
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,069
what it means here as you see for each

293
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:08,589
element of the vector

294
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,690
this form is applied I also think what is

295
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:14,230
translated in the module files for two so

296
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:20,890
then eg  r two semesters 030 and this and

297
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,079
then here basically to a

298
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,880
binary array plus it tells me what the shots are

299
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,770
this case the dear one they suffer

300
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,080
maria ordered the rules this is the

301
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:41,590
negation they don't do professor

302
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,700
presenter done as you see on the

303
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,000
contrary it is the logical negation

304
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,220
the thing  interesting ex and ago by opening the

305
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,060
vector and asking for odd numbers it pulls me

306
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,960
out those that coincide against in the

307
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,620
vector so it is something that when you

308
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,420
do the image processing precisely

309
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,250
the computer vision for example the

310
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,740
masks are very delicate below is the

311
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,460
2x2 matrix of  two gigantic dimensions

312
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,220
with all the pixels

313
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,470
maybe with another 3 deep dimension

314
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,740
for the various colors and simao alloy does not love

315
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,870
born and boolean to remove things

316
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,510
so for example when south in progress

317
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,020
even

318
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,230
good programs talk about masks

319
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,030
to remove the background etc.  this is

320
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,440
the downstream principle I will not dwell

321
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,830
much except to say that there is a usefulness

322
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:49,530
of operations that are very fast  or

323
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,700
so when we talk about thousands of

324
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,980
guided there is no problem it can

325
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,720
very well arrive millions on a

326
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,320
normal pc my laptop that I have already

327
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:09,210
worked in several gigs of data

328
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,940
too much well informed matrix

329
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,900
then makes it when they remember it too much  big

330
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,520
you have to move on to other other models

331
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,950
that everyone is inspired by never

332
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,030
facts who hangs out in the world of the present

333
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,910
now hear them talk about hawk python they

334
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:35,780
are other than you do however dedicated

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,730
veterinary tirli I would stop here because

337
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,500
then things are  complicate to be a

338
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,550
life also because we have arrived right

339
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,470
at 0 from zero so you have split

340
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:59,310
according to how they say now there

341
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:03,120
are a few minutes we can devote

342
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,380
to the questions and answers the equines

343
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,490
respond I invite you as usual

344
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,250
people to ask their questions here in

345
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,690
chat or alternatively in our

346
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,820
group the telegram is that of the

347
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:27,420
summer camp or directly we say

348
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,030
appear newto  n to the microphone and make them

349
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,570
stability

350
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:40,770
others by doing then this

351
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,750
software

352
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,090
in reality I have seen it also in the

353
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:51,570
east room and it often sells it comes to

354
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:56,789
work hand in hand with the panda so

355
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,240
if we want then if we want to explain the

356
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,159
relationship between the  two major

357
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,770
applications and major applications that

358
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:09,179
you can have in this case we say

359
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,409
absolutely no as they were saying by now and it

360
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:16,740
is the basis for many many

361
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,880
graphic and data processing libraries palace

362
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,299
in fact together

363
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:26,070
inspired by the language r linked to

364
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,390
dr themes which serves to become

365
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,360
data masters then take us series for

366
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,899
example to different very convenient functions

367
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:40,529
by means of csv to read html

368
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:44,909
patellina prepare extraction

369
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:48,240
very simple data that is basically it

370
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,690
creates a tavern when it is a table the

371
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,549
two columns says all the columns are

372
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:58,140
I would never

373
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,039
then the pink and disguised surprised the

374
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,140
yellow finished and using in a pair

375
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,070
work on a vector of all the

376
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,710
same type pe  because the columns

377
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,669
mathematically speaking on the

378
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:13,490
royal decree panel on 1 gen

379
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,690
obviously panda adds a whole

380
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,350
series of tricks to be able to better manage this

381
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,659
thing but it already seems to

382
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,279
give it coming to have this

383
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,240
homogeneous column and on it then you can

384
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,179
do a lot  of elaborations

385
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,460
even if he spoke more than elaborations

386
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,820
he prepares data from pandas then to

387
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,769
pass that will be present in the

388
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:43,820
measurement library like all the others

389
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,259
communicates thanks to the fact that underneath

390
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:53,009
there is always countryside then for example from

391
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:56,730
palmas lite work especially clean

392
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,820
the  famous polisca users of the data they

393
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,690
get going set

394
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,840
maybe and I finish with them I presented I

395
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,090
understood how they are put the

396
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,940
free and how shakey byrne to then make

397
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,450
an analysis with choose them and not happy

398
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,889
in the end he will be able to get to some

399
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:21,710
rogue software compass that  I mentioned earlier

400
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,999
takes the same campaign syntax

401
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:27,210
same idea only that it uses readers

402
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,909
to make them like things more c  omplicated and

403
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,610
even accelerated individuals while

404
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,369
but never by nature they are a

405
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:37,529
gpu acceleration that is so fashionable lately

406
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:41,009
because practically to do

407
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:44,899
vector operations on numbers

408
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,440
ok we have another question I don't know if it is

409
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,519
already answered but by marx and pandas it is

410
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,669
based only a large  and more

411
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,470
among other things I do not know if they have removed it but I

412
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,119
'm inside panda you can do like a

413
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:12,259
times.in those who can never space

414
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:15,749
so yes siena is based on the file and

415
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:18,840
this is fantastic because of the

416
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,369
open source host

417
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:23,029
if c  'it is a thing optimizes twenty-nine

418
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:26,190
not only from the integrated never the

419
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,320
developers of pau nas have also given

420
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,389
a huge contribution never for

421
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:32,809
millionaires

422
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,760
as a separate project because

423
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,280
the financial world speaks to the senate

424
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,309
so there was some money to go around and

425
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:44,320
therefore they managed to  scudetto

426
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:53,830
enough for now if there are no other

427
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,929
questions

428
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:57,280
but we have with a minute if someone

429
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,559
still has a question there would be room for

430
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:02,520
the last

431
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,130
if there are no ment  re questions I

432
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:11,650
remember that this type of folk are the

433
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,510
rules are 20 in a meet up is the

434
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,830
do-it-yourself meetup in Venice of which omar that

435
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,650
we are very presented that with this

436
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,620
evening is co organizer so if

437
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,080
we want to give some reference of the

438
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,710
mit act  they look assumes punched

439
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,549
lines curiously link to subscribe

440
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:43,210
him updated I do not choose the

441
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,870
original began with sebastian grace and I believe

442
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:53,140
that one last question will be kept

443
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,200
on the fly that is coming

444
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,360
single by max says there is a tutorial and

445
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,640
for the never we have already seen  a little

446
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,909
tonight anyway eventually I think that

447
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:07,720
even in the meetup group venice and the cie

448
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,470
can't blackmail different story then

449
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,880
conclude what I did tonight

450
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,580
use a software judging notebook

451
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,100
I will also put the link of the

452
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,760
do-it-yourself repository where there is this story

453
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,549
if you have played notebook you can follow it

454
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:28,700
anyway I will also put you the link of

455
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,899
lanvin all.org and there are a tide

456
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:34,669
I have chosen you do not do just why not

457
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:36,169
also  the most famous of the libraries

458
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:37,940
audition but it also ran in Italian

459
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:44,090
for

460
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,549
last question to the beautiful own of

461
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:50,360
marbles a quick quick question that i

462
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:56,799
de musique python and no one I use vin

463
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,230
novo more than it is such a

464
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,409
simple language that does not need

465
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:08,750
widespread  the national one and move it

466
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,990
access barbot top this information

467
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:18,110
after we can do well then I would say that

468
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,799
we can thank or but once

469
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:24,169
again for having been with us

470
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:32,080
the video then having put it online and then you will

471
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,580
probably find the link app

472
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,529
edited Venice also from the

473
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,889
project page 42  they promise a life first

474
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:41,570
goal is a community that exports the

475
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,630
project you can find rintal papa that

476
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,720
daily at the end of the year among equals

477
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,799
thank you very much and we are in the sector
