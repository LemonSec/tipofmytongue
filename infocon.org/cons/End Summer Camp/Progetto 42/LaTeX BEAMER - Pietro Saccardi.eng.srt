1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
so first talk of the evening to you

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,000
peter the word thank you hello

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,059
everyone i am peter and i will talk to you

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,210
tonight about latex prime then i suppose

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,400
that in order if there is certainly

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,690
someone who i have never heard

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,520
of milk than bim  so let's see for a

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,970
moment what we are going to talk about today milk

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,680
which is a markup layer for

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,269
preparing texts basically

11
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,250
for which I write my code and

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,230
after that hit it I get her a document

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,570
as the result and it is based on

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,980
the composer

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,160
tech typography which was created by don all news

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,610
in 1978 who was originally

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,430
frustrated with the typographical quality of

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,250
his book produced by the tv bressi

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,530
his trusted typography for which he

20
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,030
decided to create a

21
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,680
typesetting program to achieve

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,710
superior results and in the  world of latex

23
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,199
there are a variety of classes for various

24
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,719
documents such as articles or theses and

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,760
whatnot and living is one of these

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,680
classes that oriented to the  when creating

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,430
presentations

28
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,140
then we see an excellent more

29
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,060
concretely what we are talking about

30
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,300
this is an example of latex code on the

31
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,710
left left you see the

32
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,360
source code we don't care now

33
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,970
how it is that syntax a and anything else and

34
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,170
on the right and we see what

35
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,390
generated then  from the compiler this is

36
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,460
a transformation of furies specifically

37
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,110
and the choice on purpose because milk that I

38
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,310
used in particular in the

39
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,140
academic field as an example for beemer and

40
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,580
we will see in the first several

41
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,410
during this presentation but in

42
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,090
particular the whole presentation I

43
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,040
am doing is done  in beemer for which it is

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,229
open source so you can also take

45
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:42,990
this if we want as an example for

46
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,090
how to use live in short,

47
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,530
now that it is clear what we are

48
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,430
talking about

49
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,620
I introduce myself briefly I am pietro

50
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,110
saccardi you cannot find me on the various channels

51
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,280
that as I split 5 4k and I am

52
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,470
doctoral students at the research institute only

53
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,650
discrete mathematics in germany in bonn  and

54
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,270
what I do during the day is

55
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,430
design and implementation of

56
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,160
rafting rhythms il6 design that is practically the

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,140
design and project I implement algorithms

58
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,430
that are then used to produce in a

59
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,550
microchip and modern gpu and this

60
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,410
during the day during the rest of the

61
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,750
time I am busy  the person

62
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,000
commits a systems engineer of the external network and

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,280
if I still have time left over I spend it in

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,540
any of these various projects

65
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,670
that mostly get the cycles plus python and

66
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,930
whatever else I didn't mention the

67
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,690
doctorate at random because the doctoral students

68
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,460
often and willingly  unwillingly

69
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,600
they have to present no and in fact for

70
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,460
the last at least eight years I have

71
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,350
never used any useful

72
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,130
voice silhouette software to produce

73
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,600
documents and my theses and also my

74
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,120
presentations for which we speak today as

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,290
someone who uses beemer

76
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,200
frequently in the  everyday life

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,550
let's say a funny fact

78
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,540
and the last time I presented

79
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,400
something that was not done in  b blackbird

80
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,780
done in keynote with one of their

81
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,720
templates and they told me that the formulas

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,070
were not very legible on the

83
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,780
original keynote template and from that time

84
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,970
there I had said abound and it must

85
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,800
be pared bim so if I speak to you as a

86
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,280
user first of all for  who has never

87
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,110
used latex because latex

88
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,180
you have seen the source code which

89
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,980
then becomes the document

90
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,989
well first of all the case is free open

91
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:32,060
source so this is a good reason

92
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,850
to try it already and above all the

93
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,640
main reason that latex allows the user

94
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,090
to focus on  content

95
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,370
the pec does it arranges itself do the layout it

96
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,440
arranges itself to do the formatting and

97
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,670
usually the documents that are produced

98
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,650
are aesthetically very pleasant

99
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,230
really with a minimum effort the focus

100
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,819
in particular also on the part of

101
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:53,739
scientific publication in fact it is

102
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:55,540
practically a standard for the walnut

103
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,190
part of the  publications for example in

104
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,160
mathematics, physics and latex in addition

105
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,500
generate content that is difficult

106
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,569
to obtain  with standard programs watch

107
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:06,370
and see is what you get such as

108
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,680
references, quotes on a bike and

109
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,349
anything else so if all the

110
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:14,680
time you earn you don't have to chase the

111
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,959
figures in the word document in reality

112
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,430
what happens ends up

113
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,560
finding the  perfect margin to the

114
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,120
millimeter exactly the way

115
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,690
we want it

116
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,110
but if the tile really has a lot of

117
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,030
options for customization, in short,

118
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,800
this is just an example of the

119
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,840
margin page structure.

120
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,460


121
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,090


122
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,440
especially of bieber in

123
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,289
this case which is a class for the

124
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:43,630
case then we see some basic concepts

125
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,550
so we hear the terminology and then

126
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,690
we know what we are talking about

127
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,760
as well as a standard document the

128
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,340
documents partitioned into chapters

129
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,320
maybe or sections a

130
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,150
sea presentation divided into frames not  a single

131
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,520
frame each of the frames is in

132
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,590
turn divided into slides which is a single

133
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,780
page that there  I am showing now for

134
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,940
example the frames are identified by

135
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,129
these dots here you see below

136
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:08,929
and a single frame can contain more

137
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:10,429
slides

138
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:12,860
to note that the sliding imers are

139
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,659
compiled in the pdf so there are no

140
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:17,239
animations and transitions in the pdf and

141
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:19,519
moreover the format is  also the limit

142
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,509
even enough the space

143
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:21,259
available

144
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,509
in reality this is if we want an

145
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,389
advantage because personally

146
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:28,519
animations and transitions and three

147
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,050
reality powers are covering a content that is

148
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,099
not very usable on the practical side if

149
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:35,599
we want to start working with living

150
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:37,849
we have to do three things install a

151
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:39,889
tackle distribution  atec create a

152
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,019
new technical document insert the

153
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:43,849
code and then compile it anyway I send

154
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:47,389
like like this here is this

155
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,610
basically everything from here on

156
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,889
we will see some of the key concepts of

157
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,000
the key commands that there are

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,660
on girls and obviously given the format we will

159
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,340
not be able to see everything we will see

160
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,670
just some of the main things and i

161
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,410
will not particularly deal with it  are the

162
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,310
latex syntax

163
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,830
but in the sense there is nothing

164
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,660
particularly deep that happens in the

165
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,580
code that we will see even if you have

166
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,620
never seen a line of latex even if you

167
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,030
have never seen in the code and I

168
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,420
invite you to look at the code and

169
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,640
I will mark  the most important points and you will see

170
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,080
that it is very easy to understand what is

171
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,270
happening in short for everything else

172
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,330
there is from tags or internet available

173
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,320
let's say

174
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,009
well

175
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:34,430
let's start in

176
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,650
short something that you can do as I

177
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,229
present the various types of environments  and

178
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:42,059
contents you can try to find

179
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:43,439
these same environments within the

180
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,149
presentation you are seeing in short

181
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:46,289
this could be a good mental exercise

182
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:47,629


183
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:50,189
therefore a document beemer started less

184
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:52,169
than all the same way with these

185
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:53,969
instructions document class beemer that

186
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:55,889
you see here at the top left that

187
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,619
declares that a be me document is a

188
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,259
begin documents and document with this

189
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,059
syntax here this is a syntax we

190
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:04,469
will see up to  to the nausea for which it is

191
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:06,960
always the same

192
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,029
obviously this limits to the beginning at the

193
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,589
end of the document in which we send it

194
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,419
insert our frames with this

195
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,080
syntax begin frames and frame on the

196
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,699
right you see the result of the code

197
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,289
that applied now

198
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:24,360
and compiled directly in pdf

199
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,419
then this  frame packing frames frame

200
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:30,069
is an environment in this environment with two

201
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:32,080
arguments that are expressed in

202
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,449
curly brackets as you can see is the first

203
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:35,199
the title

204
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,149
the second is the subtitle and are

205
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:39,339
automatically rendered by beemer

206
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:41,199
as a title subtitle arranges

207
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,649
layout font and so on everything

208
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,869
what is inside the begin freiman frame that

209
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:48,879
remains is the body it is automatically

210
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,800
not even this receives a lay out not its

211
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,550
font so 5 non rocket science is

212
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,610
quite simple

213
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,150
another

214
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,500
gamer key are the so-called

215
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,020
blocks and you have already seen them in the

216
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,380
yellow displays  the slide two blocks

217
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,790
basically a way to

218
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,440
divide to attract the attention of

219
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,550
the viewer  on an area of the slide and

220
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,650
these are also equipped with title and body and

221
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,270
let's say that they are available in three in

222
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,970
three types that depend on

223
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,500
what one wants to convey

224
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,780
using this syntax pighin black

225
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,450
bloc we can obtain a block with the

226
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,670
color of the theme as  in this case with

227
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,400
viking blocks the block a so-called al

228
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,799
block that usually appears with a

229
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,260
red color to attract attention with an

230
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,000
example block that usually appears in

231
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,280
green depending on the theme we

232
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,280
select and then if you see them here

233
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,380
how they are rendered  directly

234
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,880


235
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,420
from milk and in particular the exact

236
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,010
same one is interested in a frame in which

237
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,780
the first moment after big in block the

238
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,390
title is what was the begin block

239
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,830
of the blog is the body

240
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:06,180
there is an extra command in this slide

241
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,540
that does not  it has to do with blocks and

242
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,149
this commands from phil if we want

243
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:14,760
this command but fixes them for

244
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,880
vertical film is basically tells

245
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,220
latex to negotiate the vertical space

246
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,720
between the various  objects in such a way as to

247
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,420
distribute them equally vertically and

248
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,040
this is what generates the space between

249
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,610
blocks you see

250
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,410
we have seen how to divide

251
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,209
the content horizontally now

252
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,829
let's see how to divide it vertically

253
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:36,680
so let's talk about columns and you see them

254
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,029
straight in front of you because obviously

255
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:40,370
this one on the left is  a column with

256
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,440
a certain width and on the right this

257
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,089
is another live column that

258
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,660
contains the preview slide for the

259
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,010
columns you can use in a

260
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,810
variety of environments for example

261
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,089
below used three columns

262
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:54,110
within a blog

263
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,089
while instead  above used a

264
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:58,670
blog inside two columns

265
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,880
we see again the usual syntax

266
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,070
we have this begin end with the colon environment

267
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,730


268
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,220
then plural and this delimits where

269
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,220
the columns environment begins and ends and

270
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,840
inside obviously we insert the

271
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,700
columns with this syntax again  which

272
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,040
wins seen countless times with a pt

273
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,580
in the colon in the singular this time

274
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,140
the argument between  braces

275
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,450
following begin colon is not a title but

276
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,920
is the width of the columns in this

277
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,930
case specified as a fraction

278
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,790
of the width of the body text this

279
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,920
command the swiss corresponds to the

280
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,740
width of the body text 0.4 and this

281
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,590
40 percent that you see other column is

282
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,330
a  by king cole 55 percent textures and

283
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,330
covers the rest of the page

284
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,650
obviously 5 percent is missing and all

285
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,800
this is the attitude as spacing

286
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,450
between the columns and automatically arranges

287
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,010
to align them

288
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,420
vertically

289
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,500
so yes we have this is

290
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,210
basically how to divide the

291
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,790
slide  in logical sections to try to

292
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,890
attract attention are all

293
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,630
rather simple things and they are all also

294
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,340
rather basic things the slides do not

295
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,640
necessarily have to be complex

296
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,960
indeed perhaps even better especially if they

297
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,130
are to be used then as a

298
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,060
subject of study

299
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,100
so let's see how to fill

300
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,920
these  columns these blocks one of the

301
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,600
elements of great lun  ga more used

302
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,350
in the slides because it clearly puts

303
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,430
clear order mini in a clear

304
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,560
visual way the content obviously are

305
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,430
lists lists in there 3 with

306
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,779
particular actions in beemer we have three

307
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,470
main environments for lists and they are bulleted

308
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,870
lists numbered lists and this

309
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,610
description environment that we see

310
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,840
below

311
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,000
clearly this generally

312
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,280
a bulleted list a numbered list and this

313
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,910
moment description is basically in

314
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,380
keyword is followed by its

315
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,630
explanation

316
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,070
this is still are

317
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,530
made using this begin end

318
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,320
for the bulleted list is begin and aids

319
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,320
max for the numbered list and behind the

320
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,900
new  york and for the mind description

321
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,570
clearly description this

322
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,310
automatically generates what you see

323
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,580
on the right note that in all

324
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,370
three cases to mark the beginning of a

325
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,080
new item on the list we use

326
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,320
this best site which basically

327
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,530
instructs milk that tells it go and top

328
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,810
add  trash creates creates a

329
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,270
bullet p  oint adds the space lines to the

330
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,160
text and anything else that you see is very

331
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,830
simple to obtain an effective result

332
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,200
is just a command there is not maybe it is not

333
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,460
simpler in a truck driver

334
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,440
tip of the numbered award but obviously

335
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,870
there are other advantages

336
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,460
the only one  what to note is that for the

337
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,460
mind description we have to put in

338
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,890
square brackets the keyword

339
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,260
we want to describe here if we want

340
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,520
an exception compared to what I have

341
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,410
shown you because the square bracket but

342
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,970
this what to see with the latex syntax

343
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,750
and it goes outside  of the purpose of the

344
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,970
talk to explain why, however, it is not

345
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,120
transcendental in short, it is an

346
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,620
important thing to underline is that

347
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,330
obviously they cannot be

348
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,420
nested so if we put unite corn

349
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,180
inside an item aisone numeretti inside

350
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,030
unite mayes automatically latex knows that it

351
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,070
must reduce the font size increase

352
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,290
the  indentation to increment the

353
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,970
counter do whatever

354
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,950
it takes so that it behaves

355
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,210
exactly the way c  ui you

356
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,860
expect ok and now we will see

357
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,690
the last last key feature of man

358
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,320
that are to have them

359
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,870
not for you basically you

360
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,600
have already repeatedly seen the

361
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,070
possibility of applying some effects

362
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,710
or some properties to the text contained

363
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,770
only on some slides the  you have seen

364
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,350
for example going back for a moment on this

365
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,330
slide you see that the sla the frame is always

366
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,290


367
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,950
the same but these two slides

368
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,090
highlight different contents of the

369
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,270
same prize this is done through

370
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,820
these overheads then on the left here

371
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,840
we see a piece of code that

372
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,360
generates 2 slides  specifically I have not

373
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,830
rendered the entire slide here to

374
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,110
participate only rendered the

375
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,450
interesting text so this is the

376
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,400
first slide is this one below the number

377
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,030
2 the second let's see for a moment how and

378
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,400
how the tech behaves or in this

379
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,460
case beemer with this  code then the

380
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,410
first thing we see in this command

381
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,770
backlash to the orc usually command

382
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,630
alone marks the text in this hands  it

383
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,900
was as liveblog appears in red

384
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,980
also the letter

385
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,500
puts the text in red however there is

386
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,450
this one in acute brackets which in

387
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,610
reality only 10 minor

388
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,810
and this instructs latex tells him that

389
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,880
this al must be applied only

390
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,490
in the first slide ok so if  there was

391
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,380
a slide the two or three would not

392
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,329
apply and this is the reason

393
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:06,950
why in the first slide there is a focus

394
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,620
in red in the second and white

395
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,420
the second relevant command we see

396
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,510
here apple is what I can do is

397
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,760
stop the slide  current and

398
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,320
everything that follows will appear in the next slide

399
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,640


400
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,500
this is the reason why the text the

401
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,110
second part here appears only in

402
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,310
superimposition does not appear

403
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,170
completely will appear completely

404
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,940
in the second slide

405
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,990
because it follows a pause in the source code

406
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,110
continuing

407
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,730
with the code we see two other commands

408
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,190
similar to  backlash which are structure and

409
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,070
physical structure is usually

410
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,660
used to apply the

411
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,390
theme color to the text in this case the

412
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,860
co  lore of the theme and this zurino you

413
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,649
see is obviously in the same way

414
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,170
in which the one also cal only to the

415
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,790
first slide this two in

416
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,850
acute brackets applies the coloring only

417
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,890
slide two in fact the first part appears

418
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,480
colored blue only in the

419
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,180
second visual slide I recommend  a bit

420
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,540
particular in this selection on which

421
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,670
slide to view the content is not

422
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,440
as pos in the sense that the content does not

423
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,060
appear in short, the impressions

424
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,100
overlay prisms is completely

425
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,769
hidden or, let's say,

426
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:17,269
the space for well-located content being a leased

427
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:18,440


428
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,570
and also in this case two specifies that

429
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,190
we see it only in the second slide

430
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,510
for which only here appears

431
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,830
the combination of all these

432
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,990
all these over gives them origin to

433
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,120
a slide that is discovered gradually and

434
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,790
allows to guide the people who

435
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,520
are following the presentation in the

436
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,080
various steps of the content a bit like

437
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,330
to discover contained the blackboard

438
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,860
to note that the having them not only

439
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,870
work with a variety of environments

440
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,070
many more than these I've

441
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,720
shown also work with

442
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,700
items also work as

443
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,450
columns with blocks and also allow you

444
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,700
to specify slide intervals for which

445
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,490
drive ii and iii or

446
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,920
slide interval sequences for which you  they can create

447
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,810
quite complex effects like the one

448
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,970
you have just seen

449
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,980
this is the first slide in which the

450
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,069
empire lacks acidity the second half the

451
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,809
second slide highlights the content and

452
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:12,790
makes the first two items appear the third

453
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,050
slide appears second two items and

454
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,609
highlights  the second part of the content

455
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,030
and the third part again recover and all

456
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,339
the elements to note that the

457
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,869
coloring is not applied all

458
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:30,160
right pause share I visit the over her on

459
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,059
those that give a

460
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:35,410
substantially rhythm to the presentation with

461
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,620
this I actually conclude the overview

462
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,120
of the features  of beemer there are

463
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,390
only two that I would like to mention before

464
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,840
concluding and they are the and outs and the wedding

465
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,340
and I highly recommend if you want

466
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,070
to learn to look for them because

467
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,540
land out in particular allows you to

468
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,490
generate a pdf document with the slides

469
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,470
without the over her so suitable for

470
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,600
consultation in which a slide appears

471
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,920
only once and the wedding that in this

472
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,270
distant moment is using as a

473
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,070
method of generating notes for the

474
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,220
speaker on the side that are

475
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,480
advanced as the document proceeds

476
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,160
in order to guide the

477
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,500
speaker in the presentation so for

478
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,540
those who make the presentation an excellent

479
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,170
solution

480
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,240
another thing that is not  i

481
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,800
actually mentioned the inclusion of images and

482
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,030
whatnot but that too is all

483
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,880
standard platek standard any

484
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,100
search of less than 30 seconds will

485
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,230
reveal the magic command to becks

486
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,809
where graphics so so to give you

487
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:32,980
an idea of what it can  do as

488
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,540
a slide structure I would say that

489
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,940
this more than immediately

490
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,000
good some suggestions on how to

491
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,870
approach beeman and how to

492
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,750
start learning my

493
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,000
suggestion  main point is exploit the

494
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,770
online resources that are much more

495
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,880
abundant than what I

496
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,280
presented here in this short

497
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,130
presentation for example text exchange and

498
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,140
there is a beautiful wikibooks that goes

499
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,290
into great detail on the various features

500
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,040
what I recommend the first

501
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,600
plus and  to read the

502
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,130
documentation as you try the

503
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,040
code and above all found the code

504
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,600
that is, do not worry if you do not know the

505
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,980
case copy and paste what you

506
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,390
see here a document try to

507
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,250
compile and then look for the error because

508
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,980
in my opinion it is much easier to understand that

509
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,540
what is going on once you

510
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,120
tried to fiddle directly

511
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,050
with idv so if you try and

512
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,270
especially when they failed to

513
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,560
read the docs because it

514
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,340
promises the answer is there other

515
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,860
things to mention use a good editor

516
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,930
with buffon a space and  a

517
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,730
syntax coloring and to a

518
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,260
math colleague who did the inter thesis

519
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,230
use the works co  n the arial font

520
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,820
I don't know how I did it second is pure

521
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,580
coli and take enough

522
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,230
time to learn which

523
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,510
means not too much time but not too

524
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,670
little maybe you have one in two weeks it comes

525
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,300
take 4 it said nice I do in

526
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,410
mm learn it

527
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,810
if you wait  to say badly I learn after

528
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,280
I have done this because it is urgent

529
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,830
in my opinion you never get there

530
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,300
we should learn because a lot of

531
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,160
people I know have told me I will

532
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,820


533
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,970
learn and then if there is really a

534
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,590
deadline to respect something really

535
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,480
that you want to realize the gamerz and as an

536
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,290
impulse impulse you do not have it for

537
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,460
him so for everything else there is

538
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,440
the internet there are online searches and

539
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,960
I encourage you to look for details that you do not

540
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,630
understand in particular to look

541
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,350
for error messages because unfortunately  beemer unforgiving

542
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,580
in error messages so

543
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,380
easy to understand for example these

544
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,940
three you see on the right here is

545
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,830
capacityiq seeding they have control

546
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,930
sequence and meeting for c  ui per se there

547
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,360
are also certain there are also some

548
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,060
downside of the negative sides but for the

549
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,800
rest the documents that come out of milk

550
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,240
that dhabi while they are really of a

551
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,820
quality of the excellent quality so

552
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,340
I can only recommend to use

553
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,320
in particular beemer to help you to

554
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,180
organizing the content was not clear

555
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,810
and simple and with this I finished

556
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,160
in time I hope

557
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,650
and if there are questions you knew ahead

558
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,309
then thanks to peter you stayed

559
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,490
exactly in the twenty-one minutes split

560
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,179
four seconds were missing the 46 of the

561
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:30,090
mentality and then if someone has

562
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,190
questions well  there is a comment since vice

563
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,350
enrico says that he is good who knows

564
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,770
compliments so I spite feelings and

565
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,279
then as usual there are

566
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,299
now the possibility to ask questions a

567
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:48,860
few more minutes and basically

568
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,299
questions as usual can be

569
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,340
done internally or in the  our

570
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,460
group such g or by removing the profits

571
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,520
coming directly into the

572
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:06,149
videoconference then max key for

573
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,820
vis  view the slides of beemer just

574
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,710
acrobat if you just need any

575
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,000
pdf file reader

576
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,070
at the end a pdf file this is one of the

577
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,470
great advantages portability

578
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,049
if you have ever been in a conference with

579
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,640
people who presented with power point

580
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,860
you know that having a pdf is a great

581
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,600
advantage  because obviously the versions

582
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:36,450
are crazy and asi questions such as the

583
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:41,480
advice to also use which editor

584
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,610
then it is the font not maybe for

585
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,289
yours for the presentation mal font with

586
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:48,450
which the code was modified in my opinion

587
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,100
there is no doubt that it must be

588
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,340
monospace which means  the big face let's make an

589
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,549
example

590
00:22:55,789 --> 00:23:00,389
this soon here is a written with a

591
00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:02,159
monospace font which means that

592
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,629
all characters are

593
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:05,820
basically the same wide while instead you see

594
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,320
here the iii for example narrower

595
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,840
than the gila or now you are

596
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,000
writing with the default editor  of

597
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,309
tech that is installed it seems to me that it

598
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,549
does not use monospace by default

599
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:19,169
in my opinion so the code is not

600
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:22,350
readable and for which I recommend  I

601
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,269
strongly went to put any editor

602
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,070
used as a source of this type

603
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,350
without a name if it is not so

604
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,610
in my opinion you are only doing harm

605
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,899
personally I use it on blind tex to

606
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:39,539
create all my latex material and I

607
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,309
use the package called

608
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:43,830
latex tools to have it completely  a

609
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,929
bit of syntax completion but there is

610
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:49,110
a variety of editors that compile

611
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,850
automatically show the preview in

612
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,399
real time there is for example the

613
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,320
online hoover leaf type cone it seems to be

614
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,580
called so I really don't have preferences

615
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,029
in particular let's say not  there are

616
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:04,980
preferences in particular as a

617
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,820
specific editor there is not united in short thanks

618
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,580
then a question I how long have you been

619
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,210
latex and how long have I been

620
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:24,299
using latex since 2010

621
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:27,389
I think for which I am ten years and beemer

622
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:31,379
since 2012 for which I am eight

623
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:33,570
in  reality so the two things are

624
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,690
quite the parallel then in the end it

625
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,389
is also in reality when I learned

626
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:42,210
beemer I didn't even expect to have to

627
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,879
find where to imp  plowing so many so

628
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,320
many new things I thought it was

629
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,269
simply a subset of latex

630
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:50,759
that produced a document then over

631
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,500
the years I learned to exploit

632
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,419


633
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:55,649
some of these features a little better so

634
00:24:55,649 --> 00:24:58,680
for a slide as

635
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,600
effective as possible also because I

636
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,520
present a mathematical thing  which tend

637
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,590
to be rather boring

638
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,110
visually heavy so it was really a

639
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,920
necessity in that case so

640
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,600
thank you as usual usually ask to

641
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,460
leave references you had already put

642
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,470
in the slides anyway if someone has

643
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,400
other questions or follows them career ask

644
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,860
you for insights takeer

645
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,490
know  where can you find you and you can find me

646
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,790
for sure on the telegram group

647
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,480
of the mit lab

648
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,630
or maybe they can also leave the min

649
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,390
staff management on the

650
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,190
east page in case you cannot

651
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,980
naturally contact the most appropriate point the

652
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,540
chat and the meter because if there are  other

653
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,520
tips are also visible to

654
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,540
someone else

655
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,190
not me  also found on tex taxi is the

656
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,950
combined point then look for a myth

657
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,920
lab on telegram and remember that

658
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,260
we also have the group between the grand

659
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,780
of end summer and project 42 yes

660
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,390
then thanks a lot to peter but he

661
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,410
was here with us

662
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:10,410
tonight to have shared experience  thanks to the

663
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:15,510
pec spin thanks to the opportunity and

664
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,460
thanks to the whole audience for

665
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,820
your attention
