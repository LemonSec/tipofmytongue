1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:06,080
so hi everyone then let's talk about

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,730
gildo and here we have in this interview

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,920
two of the maintainers of this project is

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,080
the first thing I ask the two

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,420
markers this project to introduce you

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,820
then introduce you tell me that you are

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,260
on the side there are yes giordano

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,450
groves i am the one  that then go he

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,720
created jackass italia ex precious italy

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,860
and and nothing kneads then after we get

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,260
with

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,650
fabio speeches hi I am really penseri and

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,710
I joined a little later but for a

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,170
mother let's say to keep the packages is

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,340
equal to stuff for the presentation it will be

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,239
very fast very good then and how many

17
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,610
of you explain or together do you see

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:10,940
what the leave project is then

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,220
first of all how it started started

20
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,920
that basically it was needed by me that is

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,990
I am an admirer of hope and it is used

22
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,479
as a distribution because I consider it a

23
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,049
work  est a professional workstation

24
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,400
of a good level that has also allowed me to

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,990
work even in companies with

26
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,930
Barilani so I needed de  the

27
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,270
audio packages and then I started to create

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,060
this repositories where to insert what

29
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,100
I needed because let's say nobody had

30
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,140
yet approached audio talk about

31
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,080
this on this distribution

32
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,050
until one day let's say I began to

33
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,060
see that the packages were many

34
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,659
and could become a project then

35
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:56,399
I met  fabius who also had the

36
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,110
same needs just an

37
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,799
electronic gram and then nothing

38
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,570
quite

39
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,579
naturally began to populate has become

40
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,250
a real project that involves

41
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,519
practically bringing a professional into

42
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:15,690
this distribution fabio to add

43
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,700
something

44
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,670
no other than us  however we find to

45
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,850
collaborate as much as possible with up

46
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,480
steam

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,239
we also have contacts with those who

48
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,100
keep high and disc of a musical nature

49
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,720
so basically we feel well

50
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,660
integrated into the ecosystem if we

51
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,660
want free software of gnu linux it is said

52
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,090
what concerns the antiquated audio world

53
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,150


54
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,180
then  a clarification because maybe

55
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,790
who n  Someone from the music world and I

56
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,599
heard you say from those who do not know what it is

57
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,480
boh remains a bit confused here who of you

58
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,739
do has explained what it is but

59
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,150
basically I give digital audio

60
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,959
workstation so any computer

61
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,790
can also be an art now  a computer

62
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,409
anything that used to manage

63
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:09,790
the audio in a complete way

64
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,799
basically ok another question is in the

65
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,450
group there are roles on role formats if

66
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,090
they are formed how

67
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,680
these roles were formed but they are formed and at the

68
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,049
end it is quite natural because if

69
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:30,909
first if the needs because I want to

70
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:34,060
reiterate that we basically use

71
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,470
all these software because we are

72
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,980
musicians and therefore everything comes from there I

73
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,409
am more towards metal rock is a genre

74
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:44,230
more let's say analogical let's say analogous

75
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,410
basic while fabius and more on digital

76
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,579
so in the end we  we compensate and by that

77
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,099
many companies regarding licenses because

78
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:56,769
he is much more inclined than me and towards

79
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:02,290
licenses and various things so you all

80
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,370
something fabio no no conf  ermo what

81
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,900
I said george and they are quite

82
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,699
natural and also constant roles that the

83
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,680
[ __ ] that is not here because it is right

84
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,539
so always spread them that for the

85
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:17,918
language you should

86
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,130
n't have a hand in creating parking spaces and

87
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,560
maintaining those that are there  already therefore

88
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,180
basically our

89
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,039
teamwork is also very independent to

90
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:28,360
say state

91
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,889
we work independently we

92
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:34,680
coordinate on some things more we say

93
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,479
yes then he in the specific case manages

94
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,419
tumbleweed that another version of

95
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:43,300
precious which is a rolling since he

96
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,820
also uses he plays  and uses tumbleweed

97
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,530
he manages that thing that if we

98
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,500
officially support the lipke is the

99
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,450
version we say stable

100
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,710
so if you want one can also use a

101
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,440
tumbleweed that we can

102
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,380
manage thanks to him then you

103
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,170
have talked about packaging oh well

104
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,890
I know it is xvi for me  taken for granted, however, I think

105
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,310
it is right to explain how packaging works

106
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,480
in general in the south which

107
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,910
is very different from other s  systems

108
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,370
let's say yes user uses let's say you can

109
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,510
do everything via the web

110
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,000
in the case of fabio you also use the

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,490
specific tool to make backups in case

112
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,510
of disasters you never know

113
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,970
practically it is a bit particular because

114
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,330
compared to others practically a cloud

115
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,500
therefore inside c  'it is precisely the

116
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,390
distribution then all the

117
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,730
updated packages of the distribution are

118
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,200
loaded the sources that are

119
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,000
packaged year are already known

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,350
then guided Italian saying over

121
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,090
the current version of the

122
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,680
operating system that a nationalized so it is

123
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,150
a bit like doing

124
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,800
practically a complication stain

125
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,300
like  if you compile it on the machine

126
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,730
you are physically using then

127
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,680
this is the advantage of that easy

128
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,140
management coordination possibility of

129
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,440
coordinating upstream chosen means

130
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,720
made a package send it directly

131
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,760
to the managers of the main repositories which

132
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,200
site they accept becomes part of the

133
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,360
distribution officially because

134
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,950
we  also like to work  and in this

135
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,360
way it is not that we want to keep

136
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,490
everything to ourselves or do the

137
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,640
open source philosophy and this too, in short,

138
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,650
then the soldier maybe

139
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,570
a given information that is what you do

140
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,419
explained is ubs that is not oviesse studio

141
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:43,280
is or not  if a service instead and it would be

142
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,930
a web service you skipped

143
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,810
it and the fact that the service is

144
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,940
called ubs are people do not understand

145
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,250
how you do everything by claudio there is

146
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,730
only this if in the end it is simply

147
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,370
the graphical interface  simply

148
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,449
so to speak

149
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,129
because then there is a whole ecosystem of

150
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,400
euros in which you manage as I said now

151
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,659
I have done well to reiterate it because

152
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:10,759
then let's say that if the users who

153
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,349
are here or those who will watch the

154
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,330
video are trying to understand

155
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,279
something  they should have guessed that it is

156
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:21,069
a repository so they should first

157
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,419
install one of the two versions

158
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:26,749
we said of open closed open suse

159
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:28,490
I experienced how we want to call it

160
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,499
always the same and then they should

161
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:36,529
a  add commissioner place more then

162
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:39,169
that 6 3 the bad game now I can

163
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,449
take we have searched thanks to

164
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:43,430
some offensive features of the

165
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,949
one click bucket which is nothing more than

166
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:47,659
an xml that is recognized by the

167
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,229
system

168
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:51,110
this is a little technical can click

169
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,199
on  the one click image or the link

170
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,360
is automatically installed in

171
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,729
our case a package that will then

172
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,129
carry around the whole basic system to

173
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:04,009
make a professional workstation already

174
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,249
configured after the first reboot that is,

175
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:09,949
just go to our site which is there

176
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:12,050
automatically  installed denis repository

177
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,300
exploded the package is installed

178
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,419
all the software even

179
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:19,219
preconfigured and we wish the basic one

180
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:21,409
of two rosters and therefore the famous dr

181
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:24,229
because therefore at the first start or already

182
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:26,180
working I do not have to go there to get my

183
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,860
hands to write some pharma

184
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,310
secretly this is the  what is

185
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,139
important enough to show

186
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,909
why I could get any

187
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,899
debian based distribution and ok

188
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:42,380
mentor stopping place lips studio then

189
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,600
after they love I have to go and see all

190
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,360
the guides layer work and configure

191
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,630
lard do it I'm not active in

192
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,150
two minutes three minutes the time we

193
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,460
say there is to configure problems

194
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,160
on the memory limits for real

195
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,900
time

196
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,610
you know  what basic things to configure

197
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,900
linux that on our distribution with

198
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,850
our place is the system that

199
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,630
allows us to have open if we have

200
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,400
everything configured in the restart in this

201
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,320
case forced a little to the windows but

202
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,420
unfortunately it is needed because in any case

203
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,070
the kernel is also configured at  I start

204
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,620
for a real time use to unlock

205
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,510
the memory and then still have

206
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,180
the audio now in real time

207
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,800
ok the questions to the one you have already

208
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,380
answered a bit but in any case I do it

209
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,190
anyway because every musician or a

210
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,950
producer should choose this

211
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,240
system to

212
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,820
do  music in a classic

213
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,510
windows or mac system

214
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,260
the key word I think is

215
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,140
the reliability that this is not that

216
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,959
other distributions do not  n are reliable

217
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,630
but let's say that open suse particularly

218
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,770
stino will have to be a workstation

219
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,950
so we are talking about the lim no

220
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,480
of the tumbleweed that more from geeks

221
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,610
so not the rolling version is

222
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,100
practically based on suse enterprise that

223
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,920
have merged with complexes so it has become

224
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,160
the  ip written the apps so

225
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,410
practically it is a completely

226
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,630
reliable code used regularly even

227
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,610
for work or even at high levels by

228
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,399
systems engineers and now you can build a

229
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,200
bit of anything then it depends on the

230
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,290
projects that are basic however you

231
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,630
can use music  it is not like

232
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,040
other distributions that have focused

233
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,589
on music and struggle maybe they have

234
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:40,790
high de carneri in particularly

235
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,450
heavy configurations you can use it

236
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,529
anyway as a

237
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,000
professional workstation then in the evening

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,670
you can play your music quietly if it is

239
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,670
imported in a fixed it is relevant and

240
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,709
therefore  it is reliability in first of

241
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:57,300
all is three years now will come out the

242
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,160
new version of the 15.2 opens  to three

243
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,550
years of support with the various service packs

244
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,850
as it was the enterprise so for three

245
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,829
years you have the guarantee of less an

246
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:10,230
ultra stable system to make music

247
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,130
so if a recording exhibition

248
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,700
even x lam studio wanting there is not

249
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,800
so this is the main reason

250
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,410
fabio then to add something we

251
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,540
could talk about the

252
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,079
flexibility that a system

253
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,540
like ours offers as in general what we

254
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,860
find in the world of free software

255
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,410
because sometimes

256
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,380
we therefore say a little bit of evil

257
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,970
looking with admiration of software

258
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,740
owners who do these do

259
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,420
those have been life these are

260
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,490
felt that we do not stop to

261
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,770
reflect on what we have at

262
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,070
our disposal is a whole series of a

263
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,660
world of software experiments related to the

264
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,590
field of sound design

265
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,290
the pole dc sound paolo di più d '  age

266
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,440
I speak of supercollider excellent also for

267
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,200
everything with the sc I thought control

268
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,120
all this world it is very difficult to

269
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,160
access this world when it is not

270
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,510
full control of the first machine

271
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,390
so basically here are all the

272
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,880
historical musicians and sound designers who

273
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,890
are listening to this talk

274
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,190
surely there is a place for you too

275
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,360
using this time

276
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,300
then we can do the

277
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,899
unprecedented parallels for those who perhaps know

278
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,470
softer and more  blazoned for a fee

279
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,120
as digital audio nation and maybe the

280
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,149
user software or

281
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:43,380
guitar software and say if there is something

282
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,060
parallel to our distribution or if

283
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,550
the food or if there is no parallelism

284
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,410
lyon necessarily went to him you have to

285
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,940
forget everything you did

286
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,350
before  from here you have to work in a

287
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,730
completely different way

288
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,730
before my field which is more guitar and

289
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,410
other types of sounds so not

290
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,380
electronic the answer a bit in the middle

291
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,480
in the sense that it is difficult to make a

292
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,880
parallel between the software and then there is a

293
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,530
way to work  that it is a little different

294
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,000
this does not mean that you have to

295
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,540
forget everything let's say that if love

296
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,920
exists in a different way p  lugin they

297
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,190
do similar things but have another kind

298
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,300
of

299
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,250
approach the example approach is closed windows and

300
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,310
mac is a little different and always

301
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,720
on fetching better we let cracks

302
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,150
do another thing still

303
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,360
fetch so what's what  it is the

304
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,920
best that I heard those who use

305
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,670
that of j

306
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,170
here one has to forget that

307
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,200
approach to enter the conception of

308
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,960
professional music as a

309
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,640
producer would do wrong product sees the

310
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,350
dj todt state such who uses listen and there is

311
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,140
a lot of stuff  really good and

312
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,790
professional and linux

313
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,950
but you have to timi didn't know how to listen

314
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,470
this is perhaps the only difficulty that there

315
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,560
may be because anyway you don't have it is not

316
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,090
used by everyone yes on linux still

317
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,280
music on linux still you have to hope

318
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,130
but there are some absurd software  like

319
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,010
someone who mentioned to me a few days ago

320
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,770
fabio about the guitar because I was

321
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,410
complaining a little bit about the lack of

322
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,200
guitar software, that is, I act on the

323
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,220
amplifiers and nutrients  one hardware

324
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,890
we found this low profile which

325
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,560
is practically a camper of the poor but

326
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,910
then it is not of the poor in reality because it

327
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,650
works very well I have

328
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,050
profiled sounds that this on the hardware and it is

329
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,680
practically the

330
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,170
same spit the response is excellent

331
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,210
dynamics even it can regulate the

332
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,649
voltages  of the finals for those who are

333
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:50,020
guitarists maybe for those who are not

334
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,540
anyway good stuff is done from here

335
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,310
shortly I will make profiles to put on

336
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,100
our repositories of various

337
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,440
mesa fender amplifiers

338
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,510
the ua that what it is so that

339
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,100
one downloads the excess profile  of that

340
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,140
amplifier which is practically like

341
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,430
having a camper via software

342
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,130
so the possibilities are actually there

343
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,500
that we will need to momentarily and what we

344
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,600
try to do is to inform people

345
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,790
so because we have done it the site

346
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,440
we have about makes it easy to access

347
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,830
we have a  support channel but we

348
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,860
also have the support channel of gex

349
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,810
italia so on the difficulty of

350
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,330
installing dal to this is imp  ortante

351
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,370
because many distributions maybe have

352
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:30,970
the forum

353
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,310
but then afterwards they give you answers if

354
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,380
we have as many as 200 users in

355
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,209
the main channel so there is a

356
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:38,950
difficulty here distribution problems

357
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,600
there are no problems then there are always us

358
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,640
one never arrives we

359
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,290
take and compile immediately  on the

360
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,810
repositories that is we are many activities

361
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,820
on listening just what you need

362
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,800
even for people who want to play

363
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,779
I want not to go through the

364
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:55,380
technicalities to do it we have

365
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,380
main software for the creation of I don't know a

366
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,420
piece of music as if we were in the studio it

367
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,680
depends on the genre however  if there are

368
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,240
we are finally managing and

369
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,089
configuring and packages giving as

370
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:19,320
digital audio main workstation is

371
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,140
that we have a brand new

372
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,800
version the know all version compiled even with

373
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,620
all the rivals workaround of the case

374
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,300
because in any case maybe the

375
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,770
mp3 exports to and not all

376
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,850
distributions do  but we also take care of

377
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,400
these details because we care about ch  and

378
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,410
everything must be working because equal

379
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,910
to the person says but because it is not sport

380
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,060
mp3 we are not taking and throwing

381
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,440
the software over but we try to

382
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,010
bring them to the beginning of mass 2 produces

383
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,240
time music even joe you have done

384
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,279
whole with this system

385
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,680
if  if you can do everything and therefore already the

386
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,870
matter is when you put on hardware

387
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,010
you have seen all the pages having to put

388
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,109
up to make it 100

389
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,869
% operational it does not help it does we

390
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,909
also did a brainstorming storming right

391
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:12,829
in the group look for a soul of the  users

392
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,949
even who helped us this

393
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:17,630
we got the tiziano we understood

394
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,069
what the main problem is

395
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:23,390
we made peace that is so we are

396
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,650
active from this point of view

397
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,990
so the software inside is

398
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,470
still tested and working

399
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,480
perfectly by us  it is certain that if the

400
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,400
trans from a new person excess that I

401
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,289
aim the big shot within six months to

402
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:41,720
get to produce the first song if

403
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,480
this starts  every day to report

404
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,299
I don't know how to do this he never makes a mistake

405
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,179
I don't know how to do this other loves found a way

406
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:52,580
of working his own but there is no peace

407
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,860
we make it to him we

408
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,090
collaborate with these people because

409
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,480
they would improve the mac system and

410
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,370
we send it to  that country

411
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,289
you are absolutely not is vast

412
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:06,950
and your way

413
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,070
hello and the pil to jean both us is useful

414
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,570
for the project just this thing

415
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,580
because maybe you ask inside we are

416
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,740
more experienced so many things solve them

417
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,330
a little on the fly and you always make

418
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,700
everything work  practice to the person so it is up

419
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,799
to me not to work then maybe create a

420
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:24,140
custom program that clears up

421
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,570
something that is we try to

422
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,370
improve even for the average user that is the

423
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,130
one there that I know from windows

424
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,600
there is not there to tinker but that

425
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,159
however  let's try to be as easy as

426
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:36,230
possible one has to arrive sonal

427
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,780
basically that then have

428
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,000
mother if you want a little bit if the audio works just a little

429
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,159
bit to be

430
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:45,470
told  I wonder minutes then discovered a

431
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,210
type of audio yes yes

432
00:18:49,900 --> 00:19:00,160
[Music]

433
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,679
[Music]

434
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,300
tell me the battle is made with various

435
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,470
programs for linux

436
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,160
from there the car comes or not no for the

437
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,320
drums actually I did a trick

438
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,179
but why the  I give that is me in the

439
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:18,920
sense of using carla with a

440
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,980
windows plugin and in this case she was

441
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:29,210
telling me why things even if one is

442
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,790
our group and the no I to bring those

443
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,120
sounds or plug in is forbidden to problems

444
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,590
because we have put  this rack

445
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,140
carla there is little time but we have

446
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,840
also compiled it with the support for

447
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,850
windows vst

448
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,679
I wanted to bring some little things there is

449
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:50,270
no alternative on the battery yes we

450
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,910
have many epson me who have

451
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,980
particular needs but

452
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,770
if things  then there can also be a

453
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,420
question of reactive for example and

454
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,059
samples clearly do not depend on

455
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:05,120
the operating system but there are flags in

456
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,770
which, for example, have higher quality

457
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,970
because in which they always have

458
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,860
lower quality this does not depend on how

459
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,460
third appointment to increase the

460
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,000
possibilities

461
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,640
and then what he wants to proceed with the

462
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,030
coma

463
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:26,020
at this moment of an

464
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,580
electronic song by a user of the fai never

465
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,170
paid in full for some

466
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:42,360
[Music]

467
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,670
no

468
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,720
[Music]

469
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,669
we have ten seconds

470
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:53,450
practically we are finished now of the

471
00:20:53,450 --> 00:21:03,200
romance right questions right

472
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,880
highlighting bands we can do it

473
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,630
very well

474
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,700
or we have all been exhaustive

475
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,240
coloring a question I join in the

476
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,600
chat to say as soon as I answered a

477
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,669
stalled rally for his servant in himself

478
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:26,130
I put on by abbott or I start from the

479
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,419
iso of tap and the cut for suse and  then

480
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:35,460
put the repository and as soon as you put them

481
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,640
all you need explodes you will have

482
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,419
minimal already configured from the site it is

483
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,520
very simple as long as you go the

484
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,410
instructions are three steps to do in

485
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,010
a cross one click with firefox and the

486
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,650
whole installation starts and the configuration

487
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,059
will be distributed  in a never explodes

488
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,370
nothing ever goes but the packets when

489
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,760
the view them the area more al and the term

490
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,190
explodes because from  packets packets from

491
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,650
compressed open so that the

492
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,270
term that is used that in question is

493
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,880
the example the salary yes yes but the age of

494
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,370
goa the switch explodes is not true

495
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,650
I ask a question for how long have you been

496
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,200
working professionally with

497
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,290
audino and  since the time of linux I

498
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:31,239
began to eyebrow the point goes well I

499
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:33,549
linux I started that it was 98 99

500
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:36,690
still except for windows

501
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,999
then gradually more and more to linux with the

502
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:42,129
fact that in any case and more and more

503
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:43,960
improved until then it is used that it

504
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,340
finally did  of stable

505
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,080
completely linux windows and they have been for

506
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,899
twenty years more or less in the same years

507
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:54,489
so it has been a parallel path

508
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:56,860
and then oh well this project

509
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,379
has a clear net and a half but I have

510
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,330
always played regardless

511
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,539
of the project

512
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:10,149
instead  let's say that I have been using more linux for

513
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:13,480
about fifteen years they have been more or less for the

514
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,249
same time even if with ups and

515
00:23:15,249 --> 00:23:17,109
downs they are not so much I am a

516
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:19,749
professional and the music is in a

517
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:21,850
parish choir and p  On my own then I

518
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,039
really like music and clearly you

519
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,690
do things also experiments

520
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,690
electronic music of this type but let's say

521
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,049
I'm more for the side if we want

522
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:35,200
software in particular I am interested in

523
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,570
software development and even if I have

524
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,220
never tried my hand at

525
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,230
software development  my audio but now I am

526
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,909
putting a way very often to that

527
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:47,950
of others so ok I will ask me two

528
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,809
questions one perhaps he did not understand that the

529
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:56,879
rich one if you are the founder

530
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:01,620
you play the founder of everything

531
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,440
practically we have the votes co

532
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,650
founder let's say of jacks italia yes

533
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,360
could of checa 2 if practically co

534
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:16,390
founder of cegos doc which is ok so

535
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:21,390
this is what then there is another question

536
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:26,050
from anonymous anonymous guest in the 80s

537
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,580
with a friend using a software I

538
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,200
don't remember the name it allowed me to

539
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,000
sample record  a sound for

540
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,970
example a sneeze meow anyway

541
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,970
short clips and then being able to recreate a

542
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,220
stock of musical score by associating

543
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,290
remote the sampled sound there is also  and

544
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,030
this possibility

545
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,430
go fabius yes yes there is this possibility

546
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,160
the software used by our friend

547
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,800
babil put a tracker ok and there are

548
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,590
several and even more modern ones therefore

549
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,060
that do not use

550
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,500
the bitmap type interface some use

551
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,050
the interface is  more modern for example

552
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,940
I make a Turkish name that uses

553
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,470
averages then using this

554
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,480
tool but there are others like milk i

555
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,070
tracker that precisely allows you to do

556
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,450
this in a much more apologetic way

557
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,160
so basically almost a

558
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,350
sampling function that is

559
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,140
clearly part of the fire  and here

560
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,240
there are some of tucker, indeed we also have

561
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,930
some that can be used on the command line and

562
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,770
not only this I would like to add that

563
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,840
a particular attention to try

564
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,120
to have software also use

565
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,620
blind people within the

566
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:29,980
group

567
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,110
so it is something that you are  building

568
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,610
slowly with too much we have many

569
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,370
users and who are able to test

570
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,650
this thing firsthand and we

571
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,120
ch  obviously we don't have this

572
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,020
possibility but there is still a cure

573
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,520
an idea of having this software so

574
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,360
we hope that in the future game store will be

575
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,350
easy to use even for the teeth not to

576
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:54,910
see well then me or rai

577
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,530
with a big thanks to giordano and fabio

578
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,930
for  have been here with us

579
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,100
tonight to share their

580
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,550
experience on then for the chance

581
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,139
thank you all from my heart
