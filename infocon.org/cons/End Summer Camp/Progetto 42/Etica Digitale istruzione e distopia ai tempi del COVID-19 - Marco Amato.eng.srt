1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
and the first guest of the evening is Marco

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:09,559
has loved all Zucchi for his friends who

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:15,299
offers us a talk on digital ethics

4
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,150
solutions and answers and dystopia at the time

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,820
of college 19 you will surely have already

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,900
read about the astra and the more he is a member of

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,160
a station called

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,010
digital ethics will then tell us in detail

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,750
what association what it does and then I mark

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,850
the word where I can go in the

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,809
meantime specific one thing we are not

12
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,340
yet the association so we do not

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,010
sign papers and anything else we are

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,960
currently a group of kids at

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,730
most then without a collective word

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,920
here  was that and we take care of divulging

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,260
these, however, open and closed for

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,960
rendering I call marco precisely the title

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,510
of this presentation takes that is

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,610
taken from an article written by us

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,040
atika Digitale punto org which is well

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,619
treated precisely of these issues of how the

23
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,280
school in this period  has gone

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,950


25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,590
very low is about respecting people

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,689
not only students but also

27
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,899
teachers dystopia we have not used  or

28
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:31,320
as bait as they would say today but because

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,630
we really think that the situation is

30
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,299
alarming we do not think so only we will

31
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,850
also keep the guarantor during the

32
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,560
presentation and and I would say to start the

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,750
first part we called it how to do

34
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,689
the damage because then if there is  one thing

35
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,810
we have seen with the covip is that

36
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,709
covip 19 has changed the circumstances

37
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:58,170
what they call my norm new

38
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,840
normal the saints health has changed

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,039
the level social aspect has changed

40
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:10,619
I don't know how many things have really remained

41
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,860
including the same and this maybe

42
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,930
an approach  a little psychological but if

43
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,690
there is one thing that is taught is that we

44
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,730
cannot always control what

45
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,220
happens outside of us so the

46
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,459
circumstances and the hiding places is a

47
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,620
practical example because I single cannot

48
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,280
stop a pandemic from nothing

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,530
so it has what  it happens when

50
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,030
circumstances change normally it is advisable to

51
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,440
change your approach you cannot change

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,750
the exterior well let's change for a moment how

53
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,209
I react and  ternally you weren't I see

54
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,060
what it can actually do

55
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,620
what this presentation wants to demonstrate

56
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,530
is how sadly the

57
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,920
school but also the university did not

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,799
understand this discourse but has indeed

59
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,470
maintained the same approach

60
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,209
in the article we used a

61
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,220
rather simple example to explain this

62
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,060
thing

63
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,709
let's put  that we are I don't know about the inhabitants

64
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,530
of greenland we have lived we have lived for

65
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,840
a moment we have been living in greenland for twenty years

66
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,250


67
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,160
so we are used to the freezing cold it is

68
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,410
a day for a reason I do not know

69
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,400
unexpected in life we have to

70
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,680
move to South Africa

71
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,700
we are used to all invested

72
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,950
heavily too  we arrive in South Africa the

73
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,560
temperatures rise a lot and we

74
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,490
can no longer use the same approach in

75
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,660
fact we find ourselves faced with two

76
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,830
choices

77
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,050
the first one tells us looks then

78
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,390
actually build

79
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,940
highly technological gadgets that lower

80
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,040
the stick in mind the temperatures of

81
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,530
South Africa that will cause a lot of

82
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,500
damage  environmental at alt  re nations and in the

83
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,390
long run also to yourself and to

84
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,370
future generations this and deserves a

85
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,420
very current theme

86
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,940
among other things or or

87
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,210
well

88
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,430
the lighter clothes

89
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,560
I know that any person with a bit of

90
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,300
wisdom

91
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,770
decides to put on the lightest clothes

92
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,860
then  change the approach to the

93
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,540
situation

94
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,890
here the school did not do it the school

95
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,870
has decided to build these super

96
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,970
irrigation systems of gello which by

97
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,650
the way is something that I really tried to

98
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,540
do with the arctic at the north pole now

99
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,860
I do not want to digress  north but ok

100
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,919
what happened a lot down to earth he

101
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,340
said ok look there is the company xlx it can

102
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,110
be google microsoft zoom

103
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,530
vattelapesca literally telling

104
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,439
you we give you a package of

105
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,050
free programs which is not always free

106
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,400
because above all the great universities

107
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,669
of the  big schools have paid some

108
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:54,800
money to have let's say the pro packages

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,659
the more advanced ones that allow you to

110
00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:00,289
manage this thing more and you think

111
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:02,030
that these programs are free  tuiti that

112
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,860
they come to our rescue as they did

113
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,930
they were voluntary companies but

114
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,680
it is not so the currency that you pay

115
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,330
outside of maybe the money and they

116
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,909
actually gave it is the invisible one

117
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:16,699
of privacy that thing you do not

118
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:18,889
really realize  because it is not like

119
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,449
a banknote in your hand and when it

120
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:22,069
is not there you notice it

121
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:24,289
and yet what has been done was to

122
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:27,830
put the privacy of these people not

123
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,930
only the students but

124
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,650
also teachers at the mercy of large

125
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,529
advertising agencies that have

126
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:39,860
some cases powers that are now equivalent

127
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,560
to those of and nations try to touch

128
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,779
a google product morning in the evening and

129
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,610
if you consider that even android then

130
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,000
the mobile phones are emanates bougleux

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,339
really wishes me my compliments

132
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:58,069
if you can zoom among other things it was  in the

133
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,349
midst of several scandals in recent months

134
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:03,080
because both the ethical

135
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,430
level and the security level and the

136
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,839
privacy level that these two

137
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,229
terms do not always coincide and and is  There

138
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:11,060
were very serious scandals we had

139
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,250
on an ethical level for example he placed

140
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,319
there was this vigil on the zoom of

141
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,539
Tiananmen Square in 1989 when

142
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:21,020
essentially China hit people

143
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,760
with tanks to stop

144
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,780
the protests on a test that did not  and

145
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,120
these people have been banned of which

146
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,590
some consider slow united states among

147
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,980
other things so and then ordered excused

148
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,280
because magic have actually there

149
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,750
is no law in china that prohibits

150
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,310
doing these things

151
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,190
or even the fact that the cartography

152
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,560
of which so much  they were talking it was not exactly

153
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,140
what you mean on whatsapp or on

154
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,560
I don't know signal eh eh it was something a

155
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,480
little more sneaky so they were also

156
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,860
doing as they say now comes inside

157
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,450
in the fantastic however false

158
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,340
advertising they risked

159
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,500
a lawsuit to say and many other things

160
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,910
that now I am not the ones dear to you if you want they

161
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,120
are explained in the article so it is

162
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,010
a company that runs for cover

163
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,140
only once they have done it  that

164
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,240
there is or rather that someone finds the damage

165
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,250
and when the news can no longer

166
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,070
contain it then put the patch is no but

167
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,740
we did not want to but it does not work

168
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,720
properly so you certainly do not gain

169
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,510
the trust of the

170
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,150
people for example this is a pdf

171
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,280
of the university of rome the

172
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,740
specific wisdom that will then be

173
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,810
published on our kids club precisely

174
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,370
for science book and anything else a

175
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,590
lineup I forgot a m here in the

176
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,210
center sorry I don't know why now and

177
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,230
we have also made couples on

178
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,420
archive.org  and if these pdfs

179
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,020
decide to magically disappear what it

180
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,850
says says that the students must

181
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,550
show they must show

182
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,350
documents the identity document any

183
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,430
smartphone bla bla then to the

184
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,160
teachers and the problem is that these

185
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,040
documents are shown through does not

186
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,030
know google in the  cloud microsoft example if

187
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,710
I do not zoom itself in this case we are talking

188
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,240
about mick with the wisdom

189
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,960
type ok who guarantees me the

190
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,009
essential question is this who guarantees me  sce

191
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:24,880
that google mit nova da aprea microsoft

192
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,500
pins what you want do not go and

193
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,330
get these documents then use them to

194
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,610
not know how to send

195
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,919
such an advertisement to the person in question

196
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,610
I cannot tell you it

197
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,860
would become a speculation because

198
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,669
this code is not is not  open source

199
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,410
is not open code is not a

200
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,870
searchable code so the company

201
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,760
says or looks trust me that I

202
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,360
do not do anything wrong hello many greetings

203
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,580
and this is not good for

204
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,820
us we will come back for a moment second more

205
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,920
serious case this of the state  of milan

206
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,560
always university and as you can see it

207
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,660
says that they will be registered by the

208
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,180
proxy system or professors not hard for

209
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,010
anyway I remember the word proctologist

210
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,950
is not fantastic as a thing that is a

211
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,990
tutoring system in short, all the

212
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,490
information relating to the following

213
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,350
devices among which we find  the

214
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,240
movements of the head the movements of the

215
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,130
eyes and movements of the mouth of the

216
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,680
people this market because being the

217
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,500
situation  ion before was that if you had to

218
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,560
take an exam then for the observed by the

219
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,649
professor now we do not change the approach

220
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:35,589
we keep the same approach and we make

221
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:37,930
sure that at a distance through

222
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,540
specific software of which only one of

223
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,160
a string of 89 software is conceived and

224
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,070
takes a nice 6 fax to the browser

225
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,710
I monitor you a student on

226
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,490
your own

227
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,500
then jeopardize the right

228
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,510
to privacy so things happen there

229
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,250
was an article by weiss explaining

230
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,850
this in detail who contacted

231
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,590
various schools and universities if you want to

232
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,730
read  the stay also that of the

233
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,300
lineup also icidia that the one who

234
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,460
the body that deals with the exams

235
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,560
excuse me for the university entrance tests

236
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,740
wanted people to

237
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,320
zoom on the computer no like me on the

238
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,060
screen share the screen share

239
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,190
the webcam and put at the same time  zoom in

240
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,140
on the cell phone behind my

241
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,810
head so that it makes sure I'm

242
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,030
not copying we have the dot

243
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,790
requires a lot of connection  and not

244
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,440
many people can afford it you seem

245
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,640
inhabited

246
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,490
I don't know in the countryside in the mountains maybe

247
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,260
even in the hills anyway outside the

248
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,930
big inhabited centers upload speed

249
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,280
like 1.5 megabit does not even reach to

250
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,250
pray in to pray mara maicol

251
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,770
so there is also a

252
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,040
an economic barrier a geographical barrier

253
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,250
all these things happen because you do

254
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,370
n't want to admit that the approach has

255
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,620
changed

256
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,020
I'm trying to run a little sorry

257
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,720
because I would like to be back in time after the

258
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,000
monitoring systems such as the one

259
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,480
of the state road that uses home engines are

260
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,060
called this instead  derives from the

261
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,730
University of Padua which says it is reported

262
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,460
that the test will be videotaped for

263
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,010
a maximum of 14 days but the

264
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,779
candidate is the candidate possibly

265
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:31,000
is not authorized to record the test

266
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,029
in any form from when it is

267
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:37,240
needed and this keeps it right  because i

268
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,630
dont know to register for an exam to

269
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,089
keep it free possibly 14

270
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:45,520
days so i dont know they can insure

271
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,740
that someone hasn't copied then

272
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,630
I don't know we put some skin cameras

273
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,980
in all the

274
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,050
university classrooms to make sure the same

275
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,390
thing is a stupid reasoning is a

276
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,230
wasteful reasoning and that goes against

277
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,040
the rights of these people because

278
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,839
we have to record exams and up

279
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,279
to the maximum of  14

280
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,490
days did you end it

281
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,220
that is no this is surveillance without

282
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,149
going around it a lot

283
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,640
it happens that in 2019 we make a

284
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,130
great leap backwards germany

285
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,550
decides to ban microsoft office 165

286
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,450
or translated word excel powerpoint

287
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,470
these things here from schools because they

288
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,530
consider it a  let's say threat to the

289
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,270
privacy of students

290
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,820
and on June 24th so what two weeks

291
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,140
facts rests on 9th ok 2020 there is this

292
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,170
letter from professor meo is addressed to

293
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,740
the minister of education azzolina and

294
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,360
says look look we should adopt

295
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,220
free software then the one with

296
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,280
software  that tells you I work like this and

297
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,680
if you don't want to believe me look at the code

298
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,740
they do  give someone who

299
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,150
understands these things

300
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,190
what is

301
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,490
about me we adopt the software in the heart and

302
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,220
way the privacy of our students is

303
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,920
preserved and at the same time we can

304
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,870
actually do this election

305
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,830
we kill two birds with one stone

306
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:31,950
what happens the day after June 25  at the

307
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,710
milan

308
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,320
of the italian school they go to

309
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,560
microsoft and like the joke just for

310
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,780
that powerful slap in the face

311
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,390
of the series opens up nice words hello

312

a chinese company

315
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,950
we also talk about that  July 6 three

316
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,050
days ago European supervisor considers

317
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,849
microsoft a threat to privacy

318
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,410
already a year ago

319
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,420
a step back towards these things we

320
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,699
after a year have not

321
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:11,829
learned anything by putting the risk in

322
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:15,089
fact people

323
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,870
to conclude are about eight minutes

324
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,570
trying to investigate why  it has

325
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,150
come to this and I start with a sentence

326
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,750
of only now not beautiful light all of

327
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,210
a podcast that happened i  you were among

328
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,150
other things are for the uninitiated is the

329
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,890
great the president of the guarantor of

330
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,779
privacy is sacred says that in the

331
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,460
digital dimension the rights of

332
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,290
citizens must be guaranteed exactly

333
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,110
as it happens in the offline dimension and he

334
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,220
says that he hears from people that

335
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,880
practically the

336
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,310
indispensable technology as lodges and since

337
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,800
therefore indispensable then it is okay to

338
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,750
do the most pervasive control of the

339
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,400
citizen because this gives us more

340
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,710
efficiency now I really like your

341
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,570
comment what follows after because there

342
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,029
is no turning around of the plant in the

343
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,920
teeth of anyone himself  listening ago

344
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,020
it doesn't have it anymore efficiency takes us to

345
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,980
china that is point

346
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,120
ok okay ago in a non-liberal system

347
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,650
in which citizens' rights are not

348
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,960
protected now I don't know if you know how

349
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,510
china is doing the answer is censorship not well

350
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,660
it is very high and if you do not want to

351
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,220
create me just look at the

352
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,690
situation of the dens where we

353
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,950
found ourselves also for these reasons so

354
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,990
I would like to march a to  timo on the discourse of

355
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,350
efficiency because in our opinion the

356
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,060
problem today that is according to us

357
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,960
according to bad writers is that this

358
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,070
efficiency has become like the axiom

359
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,510
with that thing that you absolutely must not question

360
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,610


361
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,480
society today if it is more efficient

362
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,460
all the others  things take a back seat

363
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,500
what happened with the school to

364
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,810
look efficiently because it allows us to

365
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,210
keep the same elections without

366
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,280
stopping much indeed we practically do

367
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,470
not stop 0 and then we go on and

368
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,540
then to those who know what the

369
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,010
teachers are paying the students and  the students

370
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,900
but maybe we should learn for a moment

371
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,840
as a society to put the brakes on for a moment

372
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,830
now I

373
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:30,280
am in this interview

374
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,100
that was made to him he continued saying

375
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,380
in my opinion they are marked on a piece of paper

376
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:40,930
sorry that if it is not the person or rather

377
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,850
I make a small correction  if it is not

378
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,570
the individual I would say small if it is not

379
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,010
the individual at the center of innovation

380
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,020
if we do not put the individual at the center

381
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,250
of  In

382
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,650
innovation humanity is doomed to an unhappy end

383
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,100


384
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,620
and essentially it's true if you don't want to

385
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,170
believe it just knows it's not the guy on the

386
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,240
stool with the bible in hand

387
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,099
telling you the end of the world is near it's the

388
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,720
president of the guarantor  privacy

389
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,510
ok if you don't even want to believe him

390
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,760
take for example the

391
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,339
american model of schools I know if

392
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,990
you have it in mind but the colleges

393
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,490
at the university in america are the example

394
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,829
of how efficiency comes

395
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,690
first if you want  try to enter

396
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,780
certain institutes you must have no b you

397
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,829
have to volunteer

398
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,860
you have to be in some sportsman

399
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,690
you have to do so many things that

400
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,610
practically to do them all while

401
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,920
deprived of sleep or at least of

402
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,670
social life and so much so that l'udeur al the drug

403
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,360
the drug l  'udeur is defined as the drug

404
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,100
of the university

405
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,710
students and what students do to try to

406
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,160
keep up with efficiency I

407
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,010
don't want to go too far off topic

408
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,150
garimberti says in his book i mit  i of

409
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,950
our time that I had already mentioned in

410
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,930
another meeting marks in my chapter i

411
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,910
talk about the chapter the myth of

412
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,130
growth

413
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,540
the irap the economic discourse for charity

414
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,110
says that we will also need

415
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,020
zero growth in our life

416
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,660
because zero growth like the one that at the

417
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,900
the end that happened with the cobit leads us to

418
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,900
reflect on the system, among other things, the

419
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,150
consequences of co vide now I make a

420
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,680
small digression the other day

421
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,260
watching TV there was the news that

422
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,450
passed underneath and received a company out of

423
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,810
three risks bankruptcy 6  restaurateurs

424
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,310
hoteliers out of ten risk

425
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,400
just as much bankruptcy so things

426
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,050
have changed and the first step perhaps

427
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,660
should be admitting that things

428
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,630
have changed and trying to reason

429
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,610
together in this zero growth in

430
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,750
quotes about what alternatives can be considered

431
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,480


432
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,030
not that we take a thing and  we do it

433
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,670
because it already exists and who cares then

434
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,850
and the consequences it can have or who

435
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,820
knows why if you think that I googl  and it is

436
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,790
the most beautiful and respectful company of the

437
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,160
people in the world you are somewhat in

438
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,670
germs I do not say this with malice

439
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,290
there are people who have anxiety type because they

440
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,180
know but how do they get these

441
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,430
targeted advertisements are not or talked about

442
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,530
this  what is magic good

443
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,200
happens for things that I am not here to

444
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,600
explain but they happen because google

445
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,580
amazon what they live from these things

446
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,950
[Music]

447
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,139
then to this reflection by

448
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:44,700
galimberti where he then says that if we

449
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,639
take a break from this growth

450
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:50,549
from this myth of growth  this

451
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:52,440
thing could also help us to have

452
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,429
a less individualistic sense in

453
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,919
people because we will really begin to

454
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:01,320
see what surrounds us the problems of

455
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,269
what surrounds us and start to

456
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,539
consider them a little more at the same

457
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,960
discourse does it for example in the book

458
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,760
politics  of the rebel who puts his hands

459
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,039
on I did not finish just yesterday

460
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,559
I was reading this part where he talks about the

461
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,960
elderly and says that according to him the

462
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,889
elderly are isolated and in hospices

463
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:25,049
because  efficiency disturbs

464
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:26,820
the image we have today society is

465
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,380
that cheerful young person you create pp ripa and

466
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,730
the elderly is a nuisance galimberti then

467
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,149
also says and deserves that the elderly is

468
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:40,200
we dismiss him because we remembered and

469
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,789
I could talk about it to the firs for

470
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:46,919
anything that disturbs efficiency such as

471
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,289
considering free software content that

472
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,330
has to understand how these things work

473
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,490
despite being in the best etc. is

474
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,019


475
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,940
banned nowadays and this thing is not

476
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,490
good we have to start using

477
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,260
our head a little more and  stop for a

478
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,460
moment on certain things

479
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,240
in our opinion

480
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,630
I see that there are like 30 seconds left I could

481
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,730
also mention in those brera with buzzi

482
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:15,410
jobs I would not have time and I think that in the

483
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,200
end essentially the concept has

484
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,080
passed or not efficiency and more

485
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,120
reflection on certain things because then the

486
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,970
consequences  all pay this is the

487
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,330
summary of the speech a you know what was

488
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,640
prepared then among other things in half a

489
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,470
day

490
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,450
sorry eh

491
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,820
I think I'm done thanks for having

492
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:45,020
forgotten  not even you stayed in the right twenty-one

493
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,780
minutes, therefore perfect in terms

494
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,610
of timing and as usual now

495
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,730
there is a space for the questions and virtuals

496
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,130
of the people who are connected and

497
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,940
can do them as usual, always the

498
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,980
internal chart through our

499
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,490
telegram group  or period speaking

500
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:11,470
live the conference

501
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:16,509
I remain waiting at home but in the

502
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:19,779
meantime I would have two questions but I will ask

503
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:21,580
you one at a time the

504
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:28,299
first is you have spoken about the study and

505
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:31,629
therefore I wanted is interested in knowing

506
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:35,009
what you have studied are you studying

507
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:38,009
this mission asks at the top thank you

508
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:42,639
for missing an exam so much and

509
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:44,739
I stopped attending

510
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:48,459
copit precisely because I didn't want to you can

511
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,139
consider the exaggerated and

512
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:52,209
radical reaction what you want

513
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:54,309
I didn't want to put my private sphere in hand

514
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:58,919
even if only for a

515
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,429
certain exam  companies therefore still study

516
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:07,470
languages and humanities Spanish

517
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,899
Japanese while the other person was

518
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:13,980
attending

519
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,659
no  n I know she is probably in here maybe

520
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:19,580
she too correspond for me

521
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,769
kat her communication conscience that

522
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,529
did not go through so we are

523
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,019
essentially scum trying to

524
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:30,450
do things because we are not graduates

525
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,149
and they still come to me I would have been if

526
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:35,609
it weren't  happened the covip happened

527
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:38,070
so I tried to adapt precisely

528
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,769
with tried to explain along the thing

529
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,879
that makes it come in the meantime cup

530
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:49,860
in the chat

531
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,000
says I started

532
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,010
mass communication sciences a mc and yes I'm

533
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,000
here

534
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,950
good evening everyone so bye cat and

535
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,520
you know  here with us

536
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,070
ok so this was the first question

537
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,480
the second question was obviously the

538
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,890
concept of ethics and politics

539
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,890
ok

540
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,890
the only member 142 we have politics

541
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:25,630
as an off topic but basically this one that

542
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,120
speaks of ethics to your association

543
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,940
is called digital ethics so  let's make

544
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,540
this distinction for a moment I wanted to

545
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,530
ask the eenie meenie and then also

546
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,750
explain this group

547
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:46,960
collective association exactly do ca  pire that

548
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,730
it is not yet constituted therefore as an

549
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,860
association but to understand the history of the

550
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,680
project and the possible future and

551
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,620
foreshadowed it ok then opens a

552
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,480
political ethics discourse many philosophers would

553
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,100
hold fire now while trying to

554
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,290
answer or would undermine fire

555
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:09,180
depending on who philosopher we are talking about

556
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,920
for ethics if we have to go and find a

557
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,710
dictionary definition if

558
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:17,140
simplistic rather than simple

559
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,800
that is that branch of philosophy

560
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,250
that deals with researching what is

561
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,380
good for man for human

562
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,800
beings humanity always politics

563
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,460
dictionary definition  it is the art of governing

564
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,570
so if we want the city bar again

565
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,070
we say that we take care of what

566
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,340
should be done for the good of all the

567
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,940
people not of some guy with

568
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,280
the company there rather than the poor man

569
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,180
who lives under a bridge where

570
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,990
politics then becomes the how to implement

571
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,210
these things and many times ethics and

572
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,549
politics go

573
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:03,539
to plan in discussions at least we

574
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:07,019
try to remain polit  ici in the

575
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:10,889
sense if in the group for example

576
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:13,619
telegram we talk about these things we talk about

577
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:17,419
politics so that related to the subject

578
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:20,730
of the digital of respect for human

579
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,929
beings and everything is fine and then when we

580
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:27,149
start talking about the political hicks only

581
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:30,269
for then no not  we want to talk about

582
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:32,129
this we do not want to be labeled

583
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:36,389
as this the person at the center of

584
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:39,690
everything as I said at the beginning and as he

585
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,720
said even only it is not that although

586
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,460
I do not fully agree with his certain

587
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,960
visions on that

588
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,609
nothing from god I do not know if it is  it was clear

589
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,600
as an answer

590
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,809
dear thank you that I would say that we have

591
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:57,269
reached the end if there are no other

592
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:01,080
questions from the public they are following

593
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,789
us now we leave the possibility on the one

594
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:08,759
hand to deepen things also

595
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,519
through our tegra group but

596
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:13,519
which in any case I invite to participate

597
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:16,980
found on  theme looking for and summer camp

598
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:22,259
and project 42 and then if other people

599
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:25,340
were not other questions eventually we

600
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:30,029
deepen in that place and that

601
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:33,509
's it  rei that we thank for

602
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:36,710
sharing and working experience these thoughts

603
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,909
on the subject

604
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:41,840
thanks to you
