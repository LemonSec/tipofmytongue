1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,509
then immediately then saying a

2
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:04,550
technical thing for now you do not see me

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,160
sorry because I want to show

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,259
after effects and then you will see them

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,990
effects now you will hear a

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,650
voiceover you what you are seeing

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,450
because it is that black screen and all

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,230
those buttons under gray ev

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,330
matter  that is moving that is

10
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,560
marking the audio

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,310
when i speak

12
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,010
vito laudes lowered up towards green

13
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,190
when i speak reaches up to yellow is already

14
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,110
ubs studio open

15
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,800
what is oviesse studio technically ds

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,680
is an acronym open brodcaster software

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,750
estate to record whatever

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,390
goes through  the computer then but

19
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,400
centered source reins because I did not

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,100
say that it is a screen recorder because

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,530
there are much simpler programs

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,349
with zero configurations that already in the

23
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,960
stalls and recorded the right for what

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,880
you do that desktop tipos the postmen

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,140
recording for those who know it but with

26
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,330
those three miles and beyond that record the

27
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,030
desktop you can do little else and that

28
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,229
is there is one  everything from preconfigured wifi

29
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,750
instead of them I study by

30
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,420
connecting things together with obl.es that is various

31
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,399
video sources various sources aud applying

32
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:33,490
fita and clicking many things I can do

33
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,040
the recording of talks to the east as

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,100
they are done every year and

35
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,400
others come  these talks and recorded on the youtube channel of the

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,130
east have

37
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,320
been distracted thanks to

38
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,950
professional hardware equipment and the ubs

39
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,140
studio software which is a practical result of

40
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,960
what it is now I will show you

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,890
so oviesse studio can do

42
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,320
much more than a  simple writes

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,440
recording and being much more and

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,690
simple program does not have standards

45
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,720
ok you start it and it works it is already on its own for

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,270
that it has so many settings and

47
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,010
programmers say we cannot

48
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,530
decide for ourselves what use now

49
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,420
people want to do is write run for

50
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,790
the video game for  a conference to

51
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,160
do an online webinar to do I

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,820
found out and why last week an

53
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,040
association asked to speak

54
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,260
and how much is f  acile run into

55
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,720
online sex ok he gave us a group where

56
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,640
same delegate call girl seen barbacan

57
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,459
race 2 but the screen and greeting bs

58
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,830
studio you could see a lot here they

59
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,080
put the chroma key behind and do the

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,820
scenes that are who knows where he does stuff

61
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,850
here you see  given also there that they write the

62
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,040
texts above the video to

63
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,370
make the modules copy the video s.romita

64
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,190
went to other sites 15 do everything

65
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,680
about them then the idea that I had

66
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,430
made myself now ne to explain oviesse

67
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,650
how  it is used because it took me for

68
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,750
example two hours just to explain the

69
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,049
whole video sector but another hour

70
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:17,090
majesty the audio and the sources

71
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,579
so I simply wanted to amaze you with

72
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,370
special effects and show them

73
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,989
that what I am doing all

74
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:27,110
live because it is the  my goal is to

75
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,220
learn even if I never have to study so as

76
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,970
not to have to do posthumously after when the

77
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,070
fact stop on the recorded in the videos

78
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,579
because everything I want to

79
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,470
record on vs south has to be

80
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,570
simply perfect  but when

81
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,670
something I can't do it in my

82
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,489
head it's not that ubs can't do it it

83
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:52,010
's me I'm not able to do it I

84
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,380
commit myself study I ask for information from those who

85
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,329
know

86
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:58,220
first it is that there are and I arrive at the

87
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,670
result at the hotel by copying  a script by

88
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,920
pasting something applying this

89
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,260
rule and don mimì strongly oviesse

90
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,200
studi allows you to do everything and I will

91
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,120
show you a very small

92
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,909
thank you envy me on the fly and then this

93
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:15,620
video I will take it apart that is what I have

94
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,750
created that you have seen I will stop I will

95
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,440
show me the tricks of oviesse  without going

96
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,870
too much to the specific who from now on the

97
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,410
first thing jonis audio this audio mixer

98
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,930
has effects so by pressing

99
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,060
a button the dress of the effect only you

100
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:42,250
microphone the king immediately a big one

101
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,320
this is the only thing I apply and it

102
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,420
is not  properly of ubs

103
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,970
but it is in my mixer so it knows what a

104
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,140
little different

105
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,570
the other thing that I have to apply

106
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,370
now is to take an audio because if I

107
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,910
now have an mp3 abs it intercepts the audio

108
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,190
of the mp3  and it will make you feel it is

109
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,880
delighted you too

110
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,639
[Music]

111
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:19,699
you feel it and the fear are serious

112
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:36,710
Jewish mathis and now I have too

113
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,949
because on the straight and matrix so now

114
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,520
I can program everything

115
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:52,039
I want and now I am in paris and now I

116
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:59,810
am new  york and now I am long but

117
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,529
there is the problem that in your world

118
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:08,749
that is the brawn help disco is coming back but

119
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:23,949
for a perfect reason ok

120
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:27,300
then you have seen this that has not

121
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,159
even recorded I had shown us

122
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:33,650
through the screen sharing of

123
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,080
multi party i  meeting ok if I did he

124
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,719
recorded cheers live in mp4 on the

125
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:43,229
folder and he gives it all because the audio

126
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,439
was that of the background of the soundtrack

127
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:46,949


128
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,740
I had the effect of the voice and the

129
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,469
transitions that were there and if I wanted I could

130
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:53,580
also push myself to do a little  more

131
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,779
complex type setting two as a

132
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:02,389
transition I can I could do it

133
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,800
so it seems that my purpose of the

134
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,190
fingers is the moment that changes the scene

135
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,940
ok but it is an extra finesse Italy

136
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,440
so much then oviesse stu  god how has it been

137
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,660
set up to create this scene that the

138
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,479
most particular thing in my opinion is this

139
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,760
you see now it has been set that

140
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,740
now I have a source which is the

141
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,340
camera and I will unmount exactly all

142
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,799
the ft that I applied on the camera

143
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,580
now I have unmounted everything and then  you see

144
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,759
exactly the reality as there is a

145
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,949
green cloth that by the way does not even cover the

146
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:55,900
whole wall of the and the one that takes

147
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,300
the camera so on one side this

148
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,500
and you see

149
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,710
the part of the tripod that you are holding

150
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,729
on the green cloth and then you see  in part

151
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,960
of the room beyond

152
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,449
and I who have normal glasses there is no

153
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,569
longer the effect of the matrix on the glasses

154
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:17,360
and the matrix you see below that is

155
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,900
still shooting is a video that is like a

156
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,819
screensaver to understand about those videos

157
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:28,020
always goes  that matrix effect and st 8

158
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,840
below because the objects you

159
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,578
insert inside ubs

160
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:36,429
you can manage them as levels if

161
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,630
I put the matrix above

162
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,599
ok now you only see the matrix there is the

163
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,470
video and the name and then yes  you lost

164
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,519
the person

165
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,870
ok ubs has some functions from on install

166
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,070
rhinitis again which are the filters

167
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,130
and finally if for example the green cloth is

168
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,029
the known in the world of cinema it is

169
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:06,850
also in the world of photography as the

170
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,700
chroma keep is called that is  the only

171
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,890
color that can be used as a background

172
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:17,529
and if I have none that is said

173
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,200
no shadow or the green color that is

174
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,700
perfect tac

175
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,589
now I have applied the

176
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:26,740
chroma key filter and raised the background and

177
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,170
I see everything there  is behind

178
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,029
then obviously I made a crop

179
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,699
of the video frame to avoid

180
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,899
this line and this part here of the

181
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,180
room that I was not able to see ok

182
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,160
so this is the cut and then another

183
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,079
thing now if you who are watching

184
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:45,880
full screen the

185
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,620
video  lenses are blue

186
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,350
and if I now apply the other filter

187
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,110
that is on the blue lens that is

188
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,300
also applied p trudu ok rest you see that it

189
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,890
passes and the matrix inside because

190
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:05,060
blue is also used sits the cinema that

191
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,040
in the photo for hole  re

192
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,010
the image when the effect that is

193
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,100
the frame more and goes becomes

194
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,260
transparent let's say because if you want to

195
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,240
link a fairly famous film and

196
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,450
not so old avatar

197
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,570
the aliens were really people

198
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,620
actors with blue overalls and some kind of

199
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,780
light bulbs emitted on the body  of the

200
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,440
key points for the movement that the funk

201
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,500
were used to do motion tracking and then

202
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,470
the post production to mistake blue on the

203
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,990
illuminated colored balls applied

204
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,170
the key points of their mannequin

205
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,450
let's say the alien and the alien smaila

206
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,520
alone because they are much more

207
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,860
advanced software  bs that in addition to doing this stuff

208
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,740
here which is very simple for me is also

209
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,320
all the production part

210
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,370
here so this is one of the many

211
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,350
effects he can do or bs from his so

212
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,270
when a person sends to say I

213
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,700
want to close oviesse because I have to do

214
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,890
xcode  and i don't know if i asked you can

215
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,040
do them then first of all you can say

216
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,740
yes or bs does it and you can search on the

217
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,410
ubs site which is obvious s project point  .com

218
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,740
and go find the information

219
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,520
there is

220
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,350
otherwise there are a few people who are

221
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,000
following my course I hope you

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,280
become as good as me and if not more than

223
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,110
me so I take advantage they learn

224
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,210
something it's a couple from them like this  neighbors

225
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,970
explain I explained something

226
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,620
to me and then for me it has no limits just sweat it

227
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,360
and if you can go on to do

228
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:56,990
something

229
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,409
very good

230
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:02,659
winning by people requires a

231
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:05,479
very simple thing type b you only need to

232
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:07,849
record minimal desktops I don't

233
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:10,069
need it maybe if there is  the rod auto

234
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:12,769
imports ok announce them oviesse

235
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:16,009
because I have bs it is complex to structure

236
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:18,619
to configure also it will prepare if these

237
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:21,289
recording because there is black screen the

238
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:23,259
standard settings are not there

239
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,939
you have to go and get your hands on it to

240
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:27,979
set which is format where you want to

241
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,409
save that  video quality do you want to use that

242
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:32,479
not new piras the most one hundred percent

243
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:34,879
in recording on computer and a little

244
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,749
dated

245
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:37,939
so if you don't know all this

246
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:40,729
information enough techn  what you

247
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:43,339
will find at ubs does not work for me is not

248
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:44,449
that it does not work

249
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:47,659
we have given for the forces so it makes no

250
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:49,969
sense to give away s the user very basic

251
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,849
basic basic that has to do one thing and in the

252
00:12:52,849 --> 00:12:55,969
wind silica stuck vote is in front of him it is

253
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:59,239
recommended for  film in the street simple

254
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:01,669
writes recorder that at the first shot

255
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:04,549
records the desktop he made his

256
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:07,339
product and it works

257
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:10,429
and apart from this effect that I will

258
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:13,249
show you I bs that there is the scene behind the

259
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:16,669
video of the matrix I am in front with the

260
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:19,159
comacchiese piercing a bit  of things

261
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,529
another thing that I want to show you is

262
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:25,439
this you see now there is me in

263
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,449
small at the bottom

264
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:30,800
simply because when you do

265
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,279
certain distractions such as conferences

266
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,920
and you usually work like this there is

267
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,790
a scene that is

268
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,720
not there  I have it

269
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,629
well I use this to help this then there is

270
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:47,850
a scene where the speaker is in a big

271
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:52,290
way so the first few minutes the reactor

272
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,540
shows up rooms I am alive we will talk about ubs

273
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,850
ok when we start talking about the bio bs

274
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,199
maybe I will show some sl  ide or

275
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:01,740
something you make the change maybe putting

276
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,420
a big difference of a couple of

277
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,879
seconds then you do

278
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,550
exactly this of solvency ok

279
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,639
coach them put a corner in the

280
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,819
upper right corner on the left and

281
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:18,720
of the black part you immediately connect

282
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,480
your projector with hardware

283
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,600
so the projector as well as being

284
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,230
seen

285
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,230
in the lecture hall is

286
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,540
also passed as a signal to ubs and then

287
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,649
having seen the projector and you can

288
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:37,630
do something then to give an example

289
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,370
the last one because I have six minutes here

290
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,750
I almost finished

291
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,389
what  I do now I do

292
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:48,989
capture edited window or screen

293
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,190
capture screen capture

294
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,470
ok and tell him or loaded which

295
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,660
screen so his capturing myself

296
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,580
goes into fractals so he captures the other

297
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,590
perfect because I want to capture the other

298
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,300
because now in the other screen I have

299
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,930
open

300
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,670
libreoffice

301
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,170
then a moment I want to see that

302
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,270
she must wood bs because if not he at

303
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,240
school to understand with skill that you his ds

304
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,810
ok now my my you  deocamera I

305
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,090
put it on top so now come to me and

306
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,030
obi and libreoffice is on the side

307
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,800
I want to explain a

308
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,350
stupid thing you know that I am

309
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,030
able to generate the text

310
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,000
automatically a cool and you can have it

311
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,860
written in capital letters loren foresees  f3

312
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,600
he writes all the text of doremi

313
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,610
xoom or near here he also made the

314
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,649
renaissance ok you can see it

315
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:41,839
for me this reboot or she can be

316
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,360
finished or alpine you if he wanted to be more

317
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,510
cd support valdar of the special menu of

318
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,579
oviesse of libreoffice

319
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:51,620
he is recognized  mind where there are

320
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,140
shortcuts what they are called and what they

321
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,870
contain there is also a nice privacy and

322
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,709
one for graphics and for internet and

323
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,050
you can create them so this is a

324
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,700
way for example to make a

325
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,760
very quick video tutorial on them  apologize

326
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,209
on libreoffice with or of s ok and on that

327
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:16,880
I save and not save and I

328
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,709
pry screen capture so the new ones so

329
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,269
I don't fear them motive the new black screen

330
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,750


331
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,180
ok if I want below I can met  tere a minimum

332
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,120
of musical high line with mp3 player in

333
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,130
order to make it come alive a little more

334
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,829
captivating and I made my sheath

335
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:36,079
dress tutorial on libreoffice or on the program

336
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,300
of which I am more experienced to

337
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,290
explain things

338
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,449
and in fact on my youtube channel there is the

339
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:44,029
tutorial  of ubs that I explain of s here by

340
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:45,860
recording ubs

341
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,990
I am doing the tutorial his bs is the

342
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,209
classic recursive tutorial in the middle they are

343
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,399
the discursive cups so I

344
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,630
often do it last gem is this

345
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,530
ok and here what is this beautiful I

346
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,030
show it immediately on youtube there  I am a

347
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,069
crash of chroma key video calls

348
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:08,459
so there is already the professional studio

349
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,959
of video and audio and photography that

350
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,109
provides you on youtube the video is already in

351
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:20,400
chroma key that is this nice grip

352
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,459
now I do those properties and

353
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,020
I read the filter

354
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,179
you see that  screen and which has a

355
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:33,320
green wall you can see the third of the screen you

356
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,910
cannot read about the room at a trial

357
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,590
from the room because in reality the

358
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,740
room is not square in kubica it is a

359
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,940
third of the room  visible for the

360
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,549
camera and what is behind is

361
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:49,100
behind in front of the hope that is

362
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,650
dancing is empty and there are those who

363
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,440
know those lights or the cameraman then

364
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,390
the structure of the room is called the

365
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,000
third for the only one third applying the

366
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,350
chroma key the green room disappears and you

367
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,840
see the effect then going to the inter

368
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,840
you will find an infinity of videos from fronts

369
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,020
like the bomb a bomb that moves

370
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,120
horizontally and that moves on the plane and

371
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,700
you can make the green disappear and then

372
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,980
first three the bomb moves you can make

373
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,890
appear under the writing like the end

374
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,960
credits of the pixar cartoons

375
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,230
they have special effects ok but of them

376
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,120
are the cloth in cartoons marks

377
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,130
draw them there is an hour and those three

378
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,679
specials in the final of the titles  at the end

379
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:39,860
of one of his videos and you search on you tube for

380
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,660
the video with chroma key that you like

381
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,790
that effect leverages the chroma key and then

382
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,840
puts everything you need on the text

383
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,840
so you can do a lot, a lot with

384
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,720
abs and the important thing is  one rip  you have the

385
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,150
audio and video sources to understand well what to

386
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,070
set to make a

387
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,759
refracting then tell from there

388
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:04,519
and all your imagination

389
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,419
compare yourself with those who have already

390
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,299
made videos or what I will do

391
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,570
next lesson is you users

392
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,909
here at my course that to you  leaf to

393
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:17,279
youtube a video that you liked and

394
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,179
life is this

395
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,129
turning the videos of what he is

396
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:23,099
explaining how to make origami

397
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:25,679
how he created it as a scene in abs it is

398
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,349
possible to recreate them the same and I will try

399
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:31,079
to interpret explain that the ok here

400
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:34,499
the  type of aesthetic workflow

401
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:38,159
can be repeated in ovs in this

402
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:42,619
acute way that a minute and a half before

403
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,260
he asked me questions

404
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:49,760
let's go back to a bar it

405
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,960
distracts you too much

406
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:02,430
thanks to infinity exactly one

407
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,740
minute before I think clean

408
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,400
and this is fine because like the

409
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,030
videos anyway  can happen clearly before

410
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,530
and in preview and we leave room for

411
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,450
questions if any

412
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,460
particular questions that can be both

413
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,020
heard was and about the project  of the course

414
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,879
and I'm on the other activities you do

415
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,080
ah yes ok he was told the button

416
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,610
at the bottom left

417
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,800
then just one thing there

418
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,590
are no buttons if I do his bs

419
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,840
right click I can see the buttons

420
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,470
list

421
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,419
mode but it allows you to see less  dinners

422
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:52,659
and in mode and grid

423
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:54,940
and they seem buttons and that

424
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,129
grid mode I can see more scenes and

425
00:20:57,129 --> 00:21:00,909
therefore it is more congenial to me when so many

426
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:04,210
projects together I am only a pro 1

427
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,499
bse except a few scenes from another bse

428
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:13,840
except for other scenes mine  bs contains 78

429
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,249
projects all together

430
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:18,879
so now that is people I

431
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:22,349
need to make this little

432
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:25,119
presentation of ubs and also the scenes

433
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:27,759
I use for the course that word next

434
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,269
Tuesday here with big buttons you see you

435
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:33,249
see more and in the simplest also

436
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:37,349
see them at this  about the sources

437
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:41,799
you can set the color so I can

438
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:47,620
tell the source that is custom

439
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,450
that you red

440
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,529
ok or the camera you dreamed of as a

441
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:58,210
red source now compared to the sli  de now

442
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,370
I do not need compared to maybe the

443
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,950
matrix that I do it as green color and

444
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:08,559
sorry but I think you are doing the

445
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,740
screen from I guess of the athlete

446
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,779
of the right screen yes so they do not

447
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,960
see the worst underlayers I know I

448
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,990
did it on purpose because I am tired  ok anyway

449
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,000
not much choose to have the sources with

450
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,039
different colors because I

451
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,230
right click on the sources that is choose source

452
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,049
choose custom color and I'm

453
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:30,850
colorless so now here on the

454
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,010
camera I can do and camera

455
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,730
the red dress

456
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,990
I do it immediately so you can see it even

457
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,580
then video camera

458
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,189
[  Music]

459
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,990
hours custom red then maybe on the

460
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:55,760
matrix and put the green then I make the

461
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,490
post has a custom color

462
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,320
I choose green

463
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,290
you are green this way here maybe

464
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,350
not even more visually simple

465
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,840
go and catch the matrix video that

466
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,640
I called it I gave her the  value equal

467
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,660
to the same you the video camera made

468
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,550
red because it was when there was and there is

469
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:22,330
whose red round saint of the r  ac

470
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:27,659
then the o thought so other questions

471
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:34,370
ah no then the fourth I could betray

472
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,620
necessary in the sense if necessary at

473
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,420
the moment when I made the video

474
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,760
and I did everything it was using 2

475
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,050
and a half percent of the cpu because it is enough to

476
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,380
have but it is from video  that supports

477
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,890
proprietary drivers with the support of the

478
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,309
gpu

479
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:56,210
so I have an nvidia 760 that is

480
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,420
old it will be more than 56 years old by now it

481
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,350
is the drive on under linux that

482
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:09,200
reads its gpu which here is called n 26

483
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,800
is so I can tell when  I set the

484
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,080
recording with which codec you

485
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,900
record them not with the software that goes

486
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,929
to all the cpu but with the hardware one

487
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:23,420
that manages the whole

488
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,809
graphics card processor that is the gpu

489
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:28,940
is usually like this when a director a

490
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,940
conference I also go to the maximum

491
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,500
to '  imperfect because

492
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,640
I don't do graphic effects

493
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,740
I only have the slides and on the one hand the

494
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,450
speaker on the other the scene changes pd and

495
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,800
uses a percent of the computer

496
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,640
another question will

497
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,179
depend on what I said now  or

498
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:57,649
the deckchair and the gpu have been set up well he

499
00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:00,649
weighs everything on the gpu and therefore he

500
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:03,620
uses very little of the processor at the

501
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,010
parks I set correctly from the gp

502
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:11,809
and vujovic 7 4 fourth generation is 8

503
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:15,140
cores and he now signals me the 2nd half

504
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,620
for  one hundred recipe mutile used that is mild

505
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,340
practically because I hijacked

506
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,540
everything on the gpu

507
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,380
if instead I did not have a video card or

508
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,340
that gpv then I would go here I think even

509
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,950
without recording at eleven 12 percent

510
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,380
then when you record the reg file it has to

511
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,030
work all the data then  it would

512
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,610
also go completely to 30

513
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,740
and I can tell you that it will also confirm

514
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,860
cobit when the ubs shear modes we

515
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,940
do not know all the exact parameters

516
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,690
to set it well or bs this is where

517
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,070
we first took an

518
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,080
external capture box and

519
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,560
attached to my laptop that  it has an

520
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,040
intel video card nothing particular was configured

521
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,830
on them it is

522
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,170
practically also 90

523
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,480
percent cpu and they told me no that

524
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,010
your po  rtatile you can not risk

525
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,310
anything

526
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,230
today if I turn on the laptop and

527
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,450
register with the box of

528
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,350
external rope then I arrive at 11 percent

529
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,180
because because over time I have learned to

530
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,470
understand the abs settings I have found

531
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,180
that the codec mpeg papi exists that the

532
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,420
codec of the  gpu intel and other

533
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,880
settings such as the setting that

534
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,850
we are super true extra fas standard of the

535
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,070
genre and who does even less

536
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,170
use the cpu

537
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:58,090
and arrived at 11 percent other

538
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,680
question can you directly load

539
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,050
inactive projects from

540
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,450
modeling program such as blender no there  it is the

541
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,520
point of coaxing quarrels within even if

542
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,910
you want to you always have to pull out an mp4

543
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,100
because it is obvious to be for now it does not pull

544
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,760
up any type of vector format

545
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,330


546
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,970
type I would like to use the sig because they are

547
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,980
from vector images instead I have to

548
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,380
remove them in png

549
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,730
who knows why

550
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,500
[Music  ]

551
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,810
this little era tore paris speaker

552
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,340
big scene two

553
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,810
ok this one over there didn't have it

554
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,850
when I made a video that the miur

555
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:43,900
omitted type behind the video of the white house

556
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,380


557
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,000
and here you could see

558
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,750
the video behind there is the live video of the

559
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,050
white house a little in front there was me and in

560
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,510
front of everything there were the microphones it is

561
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,360
practically wholesale of they were

562
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,600
an image in mestre  the fabric I

563
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,850
saw them was born to drink the possibility

564
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,190
of creating bloodhounds from microphones and

565
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,400
from the health mixture in vector no

566
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,500
works of png

567
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,820
mp4

568
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,779
but not much else

569
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,510
other

570
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,750
great

571
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,320
so being on the gpu when how much the

572
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,480
latter is loaded I think of the

573
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,920
example  on the laptops that accept a

574
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,550
little while ago

575
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,410
they have a dedicated wizard inside so it's not

576
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,200
like launching a video game a calculation

577
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,020
year this chipset born only for this

578
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,350
and then I have never exactly seen the

579
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,760
load of the gpu because now I hope to

580
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,240
show it to you whenever you want you ubs

581
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,920
below  right and under the little one here

582
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,790
wait for me to do it the same

583
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,390
show it here it is

584
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,610
magnifying glass like this or near the pro

585
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:21,010
the magnifying glass the place

586
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,720
you do not see it here  ndi now I have to

587
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,380
share both screens it is a

588
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,559
moment to make a glorious village stuff

589
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,940
finally or better alley pool only to

590
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:37,330
her you liking good evening good evening

591
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:40,690
then hello daniele hello and I share

592
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,950
the advice all the schemes because I

593
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,500
can not see how an application from

594
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,180
share the magnifying glass

595
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:55,150
because as you come it is right now

596
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,980
I know which I am

597
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,350
taking to no one else little play so

598
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,020
I go well ok when I go here

599
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,630
you see that it says the cpu 1 and 4

600
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,540
percent and then 30 fps

601
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,090
not  I have the formations of how much the

602
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,980
gpu occupies and how much it is clogged

603
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,520
and therefore I do not have that I cannot tell you

604
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,400
when the load is too much but I can

605
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,679
guarantee that my laptop that has

606
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,690
the intel card and the g7 here was sixth

607
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:37,950
generation would be that low

608
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:44,910
energy saving and then it would be that 12 gb of

609
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,240
ram but it never gets to occupy

610
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,150
even eight maybe when big is

611
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,130
the heaviest studied 8

612
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,919
ok I'm giving linux I have never seen

613
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,960
a video that was leaving you run away that is

614
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,900
when I record I always assume that

615
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,990
when the gpu can't take it anymore and goes

616
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,059
from cpv anyway there should go

617
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,640
shots never seen a new video go

618
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,040
jerky so my advice is if it

619
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,380
happens to me that the video goes to  click then or

620
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,490
set on windows

621
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:20,130
you have clogged the memory and you have to make

622
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,770
a bar and set then deviate that that

623
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,390
can often happen for other

624
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,090
programs and otherwise you have lost

625
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,210
some information from born or better

626
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,600
of the settings to put on the

627
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,200
video part should use

628
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,659
[  Music]

629
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:42,200
give less load to the cpu and gpu

630
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,809
so my advice is to look for yourselves on youtube

631
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:48,889
that I have three video tutorials that speak ad

632
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:53,180
hoc b all the video settings

633
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,670
so every single menu and every item

634
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,280
what it means and how to set all

635
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,340
the audio stations with  the various filters and

636
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,030
all the sources the first three are the

637
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:15,149
most basic ones ok

638
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:18,059
now I'm going back to divide ubs bigger time

639
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:22,139
and other questions if not you will see

640
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:31,399
you but I will take advantage of  r thank you
