1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
I start by specifying that I am not the

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,110
founder

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,830
we started in six as then I did not

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,010
have a privileged role in this

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,320
priority thing in this thing

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,020
said this I introduce myself I am stimulated

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,890
everyone I am 31 years old I work in berlin as

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,820
machine learning embankments a and I am part

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,920
of you square  coalition sedans that brings

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,210
code to Italy and yes they are one of the

11
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,030
best future years of ghent that I am going

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,110
to present to you tonight you see the

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,420
slides organs so much gives me the black screen

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:46,879
and I'm not sure if we

15
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:55,949
see it see well it's fine then what is it  it is the

16
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,730
prawn shrimp so many things it is a

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,129
community it is a site it is a project the

18
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,290
site itself is configured as a

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,570
social bookmarking site which is a

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,460
complicated word but to say income or

21
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,610
lobsters or even any use of social

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,500
bookmarking sites therefore the  the idea is to have the

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,210
centrality of the contents

24
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,790
the agent post articles comment you

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,090
can give positive and negative votes and

26
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,320
this selects what an over and a

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,380
mechanism that I think  many of you

28
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,590
have said on different sites in Italy

29
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,189
it is not particularly popular

30
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:53,009
certainly there is no other site or

31
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,259
another social bookmarking for IT

32
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,670
in

33
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,020
Italian except for the

34
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,689
view audit substations so in this sense we are

35
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,770
quite new but it is not

36
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,940
clearly the only innovative element

37
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,919
the idea is to have a

38
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,560
participatory and

39
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,480
technically oriented community what does it mean it means that

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,910
many Italian

41
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,980
programming communities are often managed in

42
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,610
a very vertical way with a

43
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,780
board that directs the community

44
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,010
according to its own ideas as its own

45
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,280
principles  and basically little feedback

46
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,269
and many poles we wanted to do

47
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:38,790
something different because a little because we find ourselves a little because there is

48
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,160
a lack of in Italy and

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,870
to create a space for discussion that

50
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,959
misses who is the subject of

51
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,100
digital technology as such, tendentially

52
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,190
programming management of

53
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,989
software systems in  all its forms with

54
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:07,200
more political themes more social reflections  about

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:17,870
how about how about how the software brings

56
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,519
changes in the real world and how then

57
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,100
software pains that bring changes

58
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,170
aligned with our values the

59
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,090
shrimp tag line as you have seen the beginning is

60
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,180
the quality to understand to discuss

61
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,480
understand how technology is not exciting

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,980
hurry was a reflection for which

63
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,049
garda wants to bring to the same place

64
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,930
different figures who deal with

65
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,220
these different aspects because

66
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,130
computer scientists too often see themselves as

67
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,230
a pure figure who does not need

68
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,420
to question the reasons why

69
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,359
cara software or values or  the

70
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,780
political perspective from here creates and

71
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,319
leaves too often the

72
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,530
information debate the

73
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,250
non-technical political reflection

74
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,900
we believe that this is problematic

75
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,420
both for computer scientists and for

76
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,549
our society and our small

77
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,130
contribution wanted is this space in

78
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,380
which it led is for example  to discuss

79
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,169
together with computer journalists

80
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:25,909
people who are in politics

81
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:28,800
social entrepreneurs  and so on but

82
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,530
maintaining a clear identity of a

83
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,630
site to inform us then you can

84
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:41,250
find in sequence a post on the best

85
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,159
practices of cuba unitis and a

86
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,659
reflection on how hard sending hubers

87
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,770
destroy local economies

88
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:55,260
good at legs even open

89
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:01,669
source software because we like it  and it is a fork of

90
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:07,650
lobsters loft punta s that was, let's say,

91
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,039
our English-speaking counterpart, in

92
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,370
reality then they are totally politicians

93
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,610
but let's say the partner is almost

94
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,380
unchanged we have added some things

95
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,289
for our use never more or less the

96
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,020
same thing and you can contribute if

97
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,590
you want  add features you can find it

98
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,669
immediately and as the name clearly rai

99
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:37,020
sends to love stairs August is a we

100
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,180
called shrimp because it was the only

101
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,860
pun we can do with

102
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:48,780
a crustacean in Italian and initially

103
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,940
this is a goal that a post went

104
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,120
open and  over time we also wanted a

105
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,700
space in which the competition and the various

106
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,860
communities that already exist

107
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,520
many of these are let's say built

108
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,080
with a 90's forum mentality

109
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,090
this simple in which the goal is to

110
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,620
maximize the number of users to make their

111
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,990
own garden and to dominate

112
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,800
these users

113
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,370
we do not believe that

114
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,290
this thing has also led some of

115
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,680
these to survive for several years

116
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,290
in this  situation their goodness

117
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,780
our idea is of total openness

118
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,220
towards existing communities and which

119
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,050
often do not give space to

120
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,840
political dialogue and therefore the idea of bringing

121
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,570
even let's say probable community among

122
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:53,440
them ok gand started in July a

123
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,470
year ago so a little less  a year old

124
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,169
professor there is someone with the audio

125
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:06,610
activated and a bit of a cough a year ago

126
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,699
we started shortly we will publish an

127
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:15,690
analysis post his ep hand we have

128
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,289
collected about 700 users something like

129
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:23,440
2,200 posts which means seven articles

130
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,080
a day  more or less from overwhelmingly

131
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,020
known coli and let's say a 5

132
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,470
percent 10 percent are

133
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,139
debate user question posts but the bumps are

134
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:38,889
contained

135
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,820
we have three we support  I found social networks

136
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,340
with basically bots that

137
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,740
publish our content for

138
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,840
the user community for the convenience

139
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,690
of users twitter telegram i mastodons

140
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,289
link to latin slides if you want and they

141
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,760
have become very central to us if we are

142
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:10,900
in the project as many a lot of the

143
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,699
games we see  it is on these

144
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:16,870
platforms consequent on the circulation

145
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,919
of contents more than a 10 while on

146
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,610
legs the same so they are an

147
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,500
integral part of the legs experience

148
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,400
we have six active members in managing

149
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,539
the same an infinity of bad jokes

150
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,110
about the domain or not and on the fact that legs

151
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,969
to the paths but forbids them that one thing

152
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,679
I discovered by going abroad is something

153
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,750
that only Italians think because the

154
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,330
changes can walk in front as

155
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,800
you can see on any video on

156
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,310
youtube

157
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,050
but the Italians are convinced that the

158
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,630
song backwards and therefore the  name

159
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,820
find him the king we have been interviewed

160
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:04,029
by several relatively old sites and

161
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:07,450
podcasts and pages and various he has  nno

162
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:13,720
spoken about us is clearly heroes gysi

163
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,350
another not added to the list

164
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:24,450
and how long how long it takes

165
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,160
then they know how to look if minute for the

166
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,990
game a slight delay in the way

167
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:36,010
considered okay at the moment

168
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,750
shrimp

169
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,490
we are satisfied a year later

170
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,470
we are  satisfied the project goes on

171
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,450
alone basically we work

172
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,279
a little on the technical field but the

173
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,120
community for the living is different from

174
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,120
what we had imagined

175
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,240
in the sense that a good part of the

176
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,089
users use it to promote

177
00:09:58,089 --> 00:09:59,860
content that I find interesting that

178
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,040
many who  it is perfectly fine that

179
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,779
being a debate space has become

180
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,709
an amplifier of visibility for certain

181
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:12,040
contents that we do not mind, however, as

182
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,740
an organization team we try to

183
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,940
stimulate more

184
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,900
discussion, which in any case there is on

185
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,209
very specific issues, it became clear

186
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:26,290
that then in  evening a sentence for

187
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,440
example the whole immune question and I

188
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,610
love it they are always there to

189
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,270
slaughter but clarify  nte there is precisely

190
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,560
a plot in a phase of continuous

191
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,540
stimulus of the debate for example we

192
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,920
regularly organize sessions of

193
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,029
Afghan feng in which we invite guests of the

194
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:52,300
title of programmer the famous

195
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:59,709
Italians to political journalists what

196
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,890
we have soon we will announce 1 with

197
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,440
ferdi and b for  who knows that the

198
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,790
cooperative alternative

199
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,350
also likes these very much

200
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,510
if you have proposals or if you think you are

201
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,120
interesting to come back without coming

202
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,510
forward

203
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,089
we are always open to new posts is

204
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:29,770
another thing that if it has gone a little

205
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,820
worse is that we will resume

206
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,550
the  'idea of creating software

207
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,400
we are all largely programmers

208
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,150
designers systems engineers and we would like that

209
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,160
sooner or later shrimp as a community would

210
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,650
start producing software for

211
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,540
example in the form of a group of

212
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,490
contributions to existing projects or

213
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,400
with new projects

214
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,230
at the moment in my opinion there is no  'is the

215
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,500
critical mass or there are many people but everyone

216
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,020
has a different competence so it is

217
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,829
difficult to form a  core capable

218
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:13,449
of completing a project there

219
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:15,640
was a project that started but did not

220
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,839
start and then if a bit my fault which

221
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,230
is called open source crustaceans

222
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,560
the idea is still waiting for them that the time

223
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,209
is ripe and we have made it understood

224
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:31,180
too much  soon in general we want to

225
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,180
stimulate networking so conceiving

226
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,890
shrimp also as a meeting point between

227
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:40,029
skills capable of saying something is not

228
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,380
necessarily within shrimp

229
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,020
but perhaps also in their

230
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,199
private sector in their already existing projects

231
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,560
this is what two notes on writing each other

232
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,260
a shrimp shrimp is by invitation only

233
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,350
this is a precise design choice

234
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,530
that we have taken from the stairs because

235
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,850
even if it creates a bit of a barrier to

236
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,370
entry we have seen that it guarantees

237
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,430
an absolute quality of the contents of the

238
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,980
people who enter we have

239
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,290
practically never banned anyone  we

240
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,730
have practically never avoided

241
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,240
deleted post edited a little bit yes

242
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,010
but let's say that they move by themselves

243
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,540
because all the  only

244
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,500
civil discussion and therefore we keep this thing

245
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,720
of screws but they are very easy to

246
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,060
request you can use this

247
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,290
link a link to some

248
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,650
social profile or some type of information is required

249
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,840
that guarantees you are real people

250
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,580
the system of myths is used more than

251
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,530
anything else for  track the people who

252
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,870
make fake accounts

253
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,410
so you can invite users but

254
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,410
if we see that five people say the

255
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,900
same things they give each other a hand in

256
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,030
chaos there may be a doubt

257
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,320
that the videos of the same person

258
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,810
are actually the same being  human behind

259
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,360
the multiple accounts and the others are

260
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,820
our social accounts you can follow us on

261
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,410
each of these the last one clearly and

262
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,020
federated so you can follow us from

263
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,260
any feed and we are immediately subdued

264
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,890
because why yes because it removes

265
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:32,050
Italian options ok but clearly it works on

266
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,840
mass  it works on though but it works on

267
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,920
any feat

268
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,480
if we acknowledge that you have in mind

269
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,300
this is how many great they are  ssima

270
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,730
presentation goes from 15 minutes later done

271
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,800
very calmly

272
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,690
[Music]

273
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,300
then thank you very much obviously it is a

274
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,120
maximum limit that of news from

275
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,490
this one wins first it is fine the

276
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,990
same salesman inside there is a

277
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,880
moment for questions from the audience

278
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,230
and if  some of the questions to ask if

279
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,030
always left internal or alternatively

280
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,800
to our telegram group or

281
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,950
alternatively one can remove the ultras and

282
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,660
participate directly in the

283
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,079
conference

284
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,470
if there are no questions it is nice we have

285
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,480
enrico who says commented nice idea is

286
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:41,280
jesus who says rip mastodons  dot com is

287
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,410
more or less connected with the group

288
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,080
behind it but if by chance there is

289
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,180
also a question I will ask you

290
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,100
the system of myths essentially to

291
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,810
make a filter so it is not is not is not

292
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,670
really a limit let's say that all

293
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,340
people who are also chatting

294
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,040
tonight or in the conference tonight

295
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,220
could request an invitation and then

296
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,960
attend well yes let's say

297
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,680
a lightweight filter has gone  but I specify

298
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,500
that it cuts out all those who would

299
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,600
join the community without

300
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,740
really understanding what it is and or for

301
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,880
example all those who write themselves

302
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,100
then maybe ask help

303
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,520
desk questions on the street or better on obstacles that

304
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,320
just like that are not allowed on the

305
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,590
platform  and then it is basically

306
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,160
not a real constraint it takes 30

307
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,430
seconds or they withdraw the invitation is usually we

308
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,440
approve them all almost always

309
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,100
immediately there are

310
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,460
particular criteria apart from these that you have already

311
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,139
said with whom he was a person

312
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:00,459
invited on one side and on the other

313
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:04,039
we call  evaluated to sell

314
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:08,419
no no actually no one is excluded

315
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:09,799
growing to return platform no

316
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:14,388
qualifications are needed indeed we are

317
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:19,309
more diversified the type my mother

318
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:22,369
written who barely knows there is a

319
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,039
computer but as a support if you want to

320
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,709
write and there is no  it is no constraint to

321
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:32,590
this thing here it is just used only for

322
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,210
a user experience that makes it clear

323
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,380
that it is a civilized space in some

324
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:39,670
mode

[Music]

326
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:44,120
ok then all we do is

327
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,120
invite all the people who follow us

328
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,320
possibly request access

329
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,970
access through this invitation link

330
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,389
then it will be useful they ask us indicating to the

331
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:58,070
compounds all of the export to germany

332
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,919
they are not the only one they are all  the others

333
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:07,929
are mainly Italian students

[Music]

335
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,010
on the exception sorry people how many

336
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,840
people there are currently in the

337
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,360
community and of shrimp

338
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,669
are 700 registered and 700 something

339
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:30,039
let's say active on a monthly basis I would tell you

340
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:34,970
100 150 the accesses we see the

341
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,039
platform are many more than

342
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,260
bleachers there is the majority the vast

343

contents

346
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,059
here it is little they cannot be estimated

347
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,179
also because we want a lot of

348
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:54,470
analytics so we only have to

349
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:59,049
access and therefore we have a precise

350
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:05,470
about 70 80 doing  the accesses are

351
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:11,539

354
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:17,539
galbero also at the bottom of our

355
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:20,269
page designs 42 obviously there are

356
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:22,850
news relevant for the future

357
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,869
we invite us to follow shrimp and

358
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:29,480

359
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,059
40 of the team to let us know any

360

00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,639
telegram group which remains active  for

362
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:43,730
questions even after the end

363
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,350
of our talk

364
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,279
in short I also never one last thing

365
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,470
wait that I was fast

366
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,389
another thing that we wanted to launch

367
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:55,429
shortly that can be interesting

368
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:59,480
for you too is a shared calendar of

369
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,399
events in Haiti and that I have  in italy

370
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:07,220
participated open using

371
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,570
software called hook that maybe you know

372
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,460
developed in italy by a dispute lab

373
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,269
maker space in turin we are there and there is

374
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:22,220
one thing that is missing in italy there is not a

375
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,700
single place to have visibility and

376
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,919
all  members or online offline that

377
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,749
there is an open space where to

378
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:36,369
play well and not easily
