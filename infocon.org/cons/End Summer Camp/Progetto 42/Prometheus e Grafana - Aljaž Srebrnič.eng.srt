1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,190
thank you very much for the introduction you

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,259
said president but in truth I

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:14,580
am here today as a systems engineer as he

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,320
said right both us3 breach

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,340
marcolini also know with my

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,029
nickname

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,750
g5 more I work mainly as an

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,849
embedded developer but in

9
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,520
my free time I enjoy a  a little playing

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,270
with the systems and with their

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,370
monitoring is in fact today I want to

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,070
talk to you about this we will talk about

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,739
two very interesting software that I have

14
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,850
discovered relatively little

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,550
for some years now let's say that they are prometheus and

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,579
the landslide and they work a little hand in hand

17
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,730
prometheus is a time series database

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,570
therefore a database optimized to

19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,900
store values that change over

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,210
time that unlike a database

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,130
how can it be possible I never sequel

22
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,100
anything else where there are

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,080
table structures and anything else

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,710
this instead is optimized to save itself

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,530
many many many values that change

26
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,619
over time these values are called

27
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,270
meters in jargon that therefore qu  after this

28
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,860
we will talk a bit we will see a bit of

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,320
nomenclature and we will see the ex porters which

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,030
are the programs that offer which we say

31
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,380
provide the metrics the metrics

32
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,060
after which we will also see graph ana that

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,430
a touch board and here too we will see a

34
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,890
bit of the basic concepts  as d'astore

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,850
panel alert we will also talk about the

36
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,549
back end so that fame is an

37
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,250
application that allows us to

38
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,600
graphicar and our data

39
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,690
so prometheus as I said is a

40
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,860
binary a single binary let's say it

41
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,200
installs them and just a typical

42
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,870
goal application as written  and

43
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,340
language the programming language

44
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,950
in which it was written

45
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,710
is open source and exposed stamp

46
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,510
obviously so everyone can

47
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,520
install it on their servers on

48
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,660
their own machine is configured with

49
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,240
a simple do it wrong which is a

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,920
standard syntax before we talked about the

51
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,650
standard diamone standards  one is on

52
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,550
i dont think it is iso

53
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,680
however let's say it is a standard way to

54
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,880
configure estonian things a

55
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,850
web interface m  inimal that allows us

56
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,270
to make quick queries here an

57
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,540
example of which you can see then we will do a

58
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,490
small demo in essence it allows us to

59
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,020
see both the meshes the name of the

60
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,860
metric graphicar la or see it in the

61
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,620
console then a simple list

62
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,670
we talked about viewed the metrics

63
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,480
at the averages  the metric is a 64-

64
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,820
bit value with a time stamp precise to the

65
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,239
millisecond each metric has a name that

66
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,090
is this so this works here to

67
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,190
sins say this between in this case it is

68
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,269
the name of the metric and this

69
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:36,010
metric can be indeed usually are

70
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,560
associated with value key tributes

71
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,590
called level which are therefore in

72
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,440
this example there are 2 1 and this is a

73
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,959
side and this pd method and the keys

74
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,090
are can only be

75
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,470
alphanumeric characters underscore a couple

76
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,650
of punctuation while the value

77
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,060
is a string  arbitrary utf8 we have

78
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,860
more types of meters that these are

79
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:12,670
managed within prometheus in

80
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,780
a way we say transparent to the

81
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,040
user  they are only used to

82
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,700
explain the type of data used by the

83
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,890
various client libraries therefore the

84
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,270
simplest types are the counter a

85
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,820
counter indicator is a number that

86
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,880
increases monotonically over time

87
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:37,150
ok such as the number of number

88
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,550
of a number of echo events while  an

89
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,320
indicator is a number that can go up

90
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,480
can go down such as the

91
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,690
number of processes while the histogram

92
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,360
the summary are data or more complex

93
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,210
they seem to me the histogram exposes more

94
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,660
meters which also exposes the basketball

95
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,400
let's see for a moment and let's give a  very good in

96
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,110
action so this is the picosecond a

97
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,750
live system or state from for

98
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,860
monitoring that sees the interface does not

99
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,600
run on its mit lab infrastructure

100
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,130


101
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,540
but here I took a couple of meters which at

102
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,229
random so this sees no slo of one  of

103
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,979
this it tells me the one minute load

104
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:25,600
of my server then executing

105
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,000
io ames refreshes the page for more

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,090
on the sea less on the console

107
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,060
it tells me the current data then quest  or

108
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,710
just take the last data this in

109
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,979
examples of metrics here and I can have

110
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:48,850
one this is a free field so they

111
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,740
can write what I want

112
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,990
this five minute panel or

113
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,090
this me

114
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,180
prometheus schmidt helps by making me

115
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,140
the list of all the metrics

116
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,090
available at  'internal database that

117
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,249
can be

118
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:10,859
many in this case we choose

119
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:12,899
we see it from the other so this

120
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,069
is an interesting thing is that prometheus

121
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:18,239
fanghi elements that on itself that

122
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:20,909
is exposes itself of self analyzes

123
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:23,069
so this in this case I was

124
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:26,759
targeted in this case  to the former this

125
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,669
should be the duration of each of

126
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:32,609
each scrape so how long does it take

127
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:38,039
him to acquire the information from the

128
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,619
various exports and here is another example

129
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:44,819
of a graph here we see meters that

130
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,309
with her for multiple so this in

131
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:53,729
this case  here here in this case they

132
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:59,129
change how much the then a very good if

133
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,549
there is something more

134
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:04,889
here we are this maybe a little more here the

135
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:07,499
thing that essentially changes s  ono is the

136
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:10,349
name of the container easter is the

137
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:12,269
memory usage of each container doc that is

138
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:16,769
running on ours on our

139
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,429
infrastructure

140
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:19,469
so here for each container

141
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:21,149
the metric is created and only one therefore

142
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,189
container memory rss and what

143
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:31,789
changes the level ok we have  talked about

144
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:34,739
scraping because because

145
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:37,049
we say the model of acquisition of these meters

146
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:40,709
which is the opposite of the usual nuggets

147
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:43,079
already bix which are software other

148
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:49,259
monitoring software this model here

149
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,299
the model of prometheus foresees the pool

150
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:53,719
so it is the prometheus server itself to

151
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:57,310
do the polling  regularly on

152
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,770
all and all the configured instances and

153
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,440
the metrics are saved this pole is a

154
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,670
simple http call so here is the

155
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,500
concept there are two concepts yes they are at the

156
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,330
instance of the jobs jobs in essence they are

157
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,140
groups of several instances I therefore can

158
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,320
have distances  with a single jobs it is for

159
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,520
example I want to monitor the cpi is the

160
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,550
ram and all the hardware statistics of

161
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,919
my of my servants kidneys  o 10

162
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,480
from here the job will be one that will

163
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,130
acquire the hardware statistics of

164
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,929
my servers and the stand will be one for

165
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:41,500
each server

166
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,020
this is then also reflected in the configuration file

167
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,079


168
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,600
I could obviously also have more jobs and

169
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,220
for example I want to have the

170
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,320
hardware status and  on the

171
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,150
same server also for example the

172
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,470
statistics of angie knicks

173
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,260
so all this works thanks to the

174
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,910
ex porters which are precisely these

175
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:11,010
programs that expose the metrics

176
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,330
so that in prometheus it can then

177
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,620
acquire them usually expose a

178
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,320
single end point that is a url l on

179
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,070
which  metrics are available of

180
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,810
prometeo you make a call but

181
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,430
http and you save the result of meters

182
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,650
that there are really really

183
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,600
sorry export of solutions are

184
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,390
really a lot below there is a link

185
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,350
to the official page

186
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,100
and these are only the supported

187
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,450
ones let's say those mentioned  on the

188
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,580
prometheus page

189
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,930
if you take a ride on a card and look for

190
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,920
exports there are avalanches  and really

191
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,410
and it is also quite easy thanks to the

192
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,420
libraries to write one for your own for

193
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,180
your own software for your own for your

194
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,090
own uses here is one thing that we

195
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,680
for example at the mild but used is

196
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,350
the export enemy tt and then we had the

197
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,740
dashboard that interrogated  our

198
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,660
some devices that were connected

199
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,890
to our network that talked in via

200
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,290
friend tt and gave for example the

201
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,880
temperature and humidity of the

202
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:36,070
server room finally we saw it

203
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,110
quickly there are queries and that are

204
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,950
the way to extract my information

205
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,780
from the prometheus database these are

206
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,480
also used then inside gr fame so

207
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,280
that fame does nothing but

208
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,750
make queries on prometheus a

209
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,260
couple of query examples so the first one

210
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,960
that is then simply returns me

211
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,950
the total of all requests

212
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,450
made for example  on the apache servers

213
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,040
then for all for all the url for

214
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,950
all for all my jobs

215
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,440
here instead we see only the job ap server

216
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,870
and therefore this  provides that maybe or two

217
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,020
http servers

218
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,210
one that serves the bees is one that does the service for the

219
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,040
website and then with this I can

220
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,720
filter

221
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,089
my my metrics to extract only a

222
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,220
part the thing that interests me in this

223
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,480
case all  the calls to the bees that

224
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,290
have commerce let's say as moeller

225
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,379
so all the calls to comment

226
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:46,079
I can also use a matching with

227
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,779
regex so use http re this work

228
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,970
in this case is here all the jobs that

229
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,850
start for server so all so

230
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,100
I can use in  substance normal regex

231
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,120
to select to group more jobs

232
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,170
more read more values of the label job

233
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,120
similar mind I can use the non max

234
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,779
of the reggae xvi in this case I

235
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,399
select all the requests that do not

236
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:21,949
have a status 404 xx of all I

237
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,910
select all the metrics that are not

238
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,329
errors

239
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:27,019
all requests that are not errors

240
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:29,399
here instead we see the use of a

241
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,290
function there are several in

242
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,850
prometheus this one here looks

243
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,730
at me how much it is changing  ando are

244
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,040
changing my requests in a

245
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,740
five-minute window

246
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,420
finally within my queries I

247
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:50,430
can also use I can also use

248
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,089
ethical rhythm operators

249
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:53,850
if my meters that have the same

250
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,040
unit of measurement I can very well do

251
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,000
operations in this case the use  of

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,370
memory the free memory we say in da

253
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,050
gigabyte gb

254
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:13,829
no honestly so these queries

255
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:18,420
are not particularly in the sense that looking at

256
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,089
the query car is not particularly

257
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:23,959
illuminating we need something to be able to

258
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,670
show and view these queries

259
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,089
so that we immediately notice if

260
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:31,649
something is not  it works

261
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:34,790
and here fame comes into

262
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,430
play is an analytics and

263
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,499
monitoring system that allows us to

264
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:44,699
view nice graphical graphs in

265
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:49,499
this case it is to create do all earth

266
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:53,160
then generate some e-

267
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,519
mail messages if some conditions

268
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,149
are met and modular so it

269
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:01,679
can be installed multi  plug in and

270
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,920
packaged in a very simple way

271
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,290
does not install with apt get  if you are on

272
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:12,839
debian derivative or dnf if you are on refat

273
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,470
this is also developed in joint the

274
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,269
front end xc also this was

275
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:20,129
completely open source it is therefore

276
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:22,860
selfoss table an interesting thing is

277
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,199
that multi tenant and multi multiuser

278
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,209
so I can manage the concept of

279
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:28,980
organizations so I can with a single

280
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,470
instance of gr fan to manage multiple

281
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,889
organizations with multiple back ends and multiple

282
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:37,769
users halloween support of alle doc is

283
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:40,829
always a very very convenient thing and

284
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:42,899
multiple back end support so it can be

285
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:44,999
able to connect to do those not

286
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:46,910
only to  3 matheus but also to the flex of be

287
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,220
the watch also in place also special

288
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,429
if anything sequel is a myriad of others of

289
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:57,059
other back end before seeing it in

290
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,929
action there are still a couple

291
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:01,620
of basic concepts

292
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,990
indeed let's see the first here is

293
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,490
the aspect  let's say of one of a

294
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,959
graphical transports we can have

295
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,370
tables all this is completely

296
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,209
customizable by the user therefore with

297
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,720
graphical tables

298
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,009
all things that allow us to have  a

299
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:22,019
direct glance on your

300
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,089
infrastructure

301
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,740
here are the concepts between basic concepts

302
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,709
are the back end that the database

303
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:31,379
on which they do business queries the

304
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:33,389
dashboard because they are a set of several

305
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:35,519
panels and the panel that precisely the

306
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,089
representation of one  or more queries

307
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,590
then

308
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,620
the nice one of let's see it the last

309
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,710
edition

310
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,180
here we are here this is an example of

311
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,290
didasco this has always been

312
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,550
on the infrastructure of the mit this is

313
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:05,380
precise is looking at the state of the club

314
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,590
so here you see a bit of cage these

315
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:15,050
are then  here it is then this here

316
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,180
you see a display system that

317
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,440
there are several

318
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,340
so here you can choose how to

319
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,710
display this metric

320
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,270
here based on this we will also choose the

321
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,880
query this measure the average of this

322
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,430
instance of this of this metric that

323
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:36,830
pga then  here in the last interval it

324
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,710
measures on average what was

325
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:46,490
on the post stoneware instance here instead

326
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,190
we have another metric this

327
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,410
depends a bit on the  ex porter these have

328
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,720
used the xporter dg club that

329
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,270
integrated into the package

330
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,530
then that exposes me an electric

331
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:02,810
one called app and that has some jobs a bit the

332
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,119
nice thing bb raffa nike e auto

333
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,770
completes the jobs

334
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,880
so here I can choose to

335
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,069
change for example the display

336
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,510
will not change because thank goodness

337
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,630
in the last three hours all

338
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,709
the systems were online

339
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,370
ok something a little more interesting

340
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,230
not providing less

341
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,850
here it is so here in essence we do

342
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,130
the trick we have seen before but

343
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,490
murray lable  of rice man total and the

344
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,510
instance here this we will see it we will

345
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,129
see it after the variables

346
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,430
so this case mi miroir mimì

347
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,930
calculates the memory the total memory if

348
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:04,710
here there are two one for this

349
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,500
this cage and the other for the graph

350
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,390
in the background  you see in these years

351
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,740
to put a direction that

352
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,980
allows me to look at both see

353
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,880
both things at the same time

354
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,060
ok here we also have another type of

355
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,140
visualization this is the most

356
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:32,520
common one so the graph here we can

357
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,140
insert more qr at the same time here

358
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,950
the query is a little more complex

359
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,300
here too we can select so

360
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,360
from the graph here I can add for

361
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,340
example the technical excuse the bacteria

362
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,610
solution here it is the legend so

363
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,520
here I can  hide extract only graph

364
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,320
show the legend choose which data to

365
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,580
add to the maximum the average all

366
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,140
these maximum minimum values are

367
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,240
calculated based on the interval that one

368
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,220
chooses and finally here I could

369
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,030
configure alerts so if the average

370
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:24,500
of my query is above 500 600

371
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,600
ok  so here I also see it

372
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,050
and sorry the unit of measurement is the

373
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,020
seconds so when this

374
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:47,080
interval exceeds 0.6 seconds it

375
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,040
will send me a message stay great for

376
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,350
example let's delete it that I am

377
00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:00,860
bombing there and this is the having thing so

378
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,990
gr they will do a continue  really

379
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,720
only one dashboard but I can configure

380
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,590
how many and how many I want this is an

381
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,820
alt  ro example incidents this is the are

382
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,070
the statistics of our shadows towards

383
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,700
proxy and here you see that how can it be

384
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,110
complicated let's say it a dashboard

385
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,610
this shows the number of

386
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,650
404 errors this here is a single stack with one

387
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,480
digit here too you see the sum of the in

388
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,670
crisis of the  traffic service network of this

389
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:43,070
is the name of the metric lops with the

390
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:47,680
404 code with the protocol that I can define

391
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,090
when you see this dollar this

392
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,500
this when variable in talking

393
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,660
move in a moment let's go back to books

394
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,470
here let's see it immediately so one of the

395
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:05,330
nice things is that each dashboard is a

396
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,150
file  jayson and there is a special

397
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:13,520
officer let's see here we are tight with

398
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,250
time well right well here is jason fashion

399
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:26,050
so this is not to show me

400
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,610
we rather choose simpler time

401
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,830
[Music]

402
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,920
jason mode and here we are this is

403
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,410
our dashboard represented in a

404
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,420
jason i  may i want i can make

405
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,450
changes directly here all data

406
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,350
completion and i may seem is my

407
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,690
jason will be applied  this allows me

408
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,840
to easily copy and export

409
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,300
mine my dashboards also allows you to

410
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,750
share it in fact there is a repository

411
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,010
on this link

412
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,360
there is an official repository.

413
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,810


414
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,590


415
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,490


416
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:27,380
ok the robot steals another two

417
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,240
minutes to talk about the variables and the

418
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,390
variables allow me to focus

419
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,130
on some precise data within

420
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,200
my network are extracted with a

421
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,100
query or I can also put them fixed

422
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,060
are used within

423
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,920
my queries with

424
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,200
let's see the panels immediately so if the

425
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,660
sport settings fraia bowles curtain

426
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,620
here they are then this you see extracts the

427
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,169
values of the labels from this metric here

428
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,470
so the result of this one of

429
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,690
these now there is only one there is only one

430
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,870
label is in here

431
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:14,709
we choose  there is one this picture

432
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,769
[Music]

433
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:25,520
marco launch in the large here we are

434
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,010
so when I see this node it comes over

435
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,480
it is replaced  before

436
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,490
executing the query replacing it with the

437
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,470
value of the selected one of my

438
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:40,070
variable here well I conclude by saying that

439
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:45,049
this short very small overview we will

440
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,070
repeat it in a more

441
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,630
detailed way next week

442
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:52,039
Wednesday at the mit lab we will

443
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,240
organize an evening

444
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,200
dedicated to this combo teague la

445
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,080
fame plus prometheus we will show

446
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,279
everyone how we are

447
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:06,020
verifying how we are verifying

448
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,220
ours is our infrastructure on

449
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,450
the baby club immediately if not if he did not

450
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,429
mention if someone does not know him it is

451
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:16,970
the castristi trieste therefore a place

452
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,549
where technology enthusiasts

453
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:23,270
meet  said that yes I invite you

454
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,640
all Wednesday thank you very much for

455
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,460
your attention there are questions online

456
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,220
directly there are questions

457
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,740
this is a question if someone who

458
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,440
cut to put in the chat or on

459
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,399
the telegram group or directly

460
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,960
turn on the microphone will turn on the video

461
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:53,330
speak then take a  moment I the

462
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,370
word for anyway riag  hook me to

463
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,929
what alias said about the

464
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:05,440
program because the in-depth studies

465
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,659
will generally be able to be carried out

466
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:11,570
in other evenings and therefore we at

467
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,049
present level 42 also keep track of the

468
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,120
in-depth evenings practically

469
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,950
on

470
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,970
the project 42 also found at the

471
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,639
evenings of the various groups or  be an

472
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:26,440
element that will be communicated with

473
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,620
colonized by the various groups

474
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,510
if someone anticipates someone's

475
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,760
question if someone needs the

476
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,950
slides are available at this

477
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,899
address here we have a question well and

478
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:44,710
there is just that we all know there is

479
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,190
access and  does something like template

480
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,919
to configure many hosts simply

481
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,419
not in the sense that you have the dashboard

482
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:00,669
usually now you see what you mean by

483
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:03,220
many hosts but if I want to monitor the

484
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:09,340
same thing on more on more hosts then on

485
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,500
more for example if I use promises host

486
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:19,149
now let's see if a on many hosts ok he

487
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:23,350
specified then yes what

488
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,880
you usually do is create a dashboard

489
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,860
and you create a variable and you do it and spread it

490
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,260
for each to host and then from the

491
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:39,909
menu above we see if then we choose

492
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:46,750
a dashboard a little more that has a

493
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:53,889
minimum of maybe this is essentially

494
00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:55,659
what you do and you make a dashboard

495
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:58,090
that demonstrates all  the things that

496
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,279
interest you for only one and then make a

497
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,899
variable so that you can

498
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:04,120
select can select lost that

499
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,260
you are interested in

500
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,029
these variables here if you want then let's say

501
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:13,950
as type of variable then define them

502
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,379
then define them many multi value and

503
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,330
then include then show all the

504
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,309
metrics immediately if you want to see a

505
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:28,740
super super wide vision

506
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,039
or you can select several foreigners

507
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:35,750
see them multiple at the same time

508
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,399

509

question it suffers excellent and thanks

510
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:49,860
