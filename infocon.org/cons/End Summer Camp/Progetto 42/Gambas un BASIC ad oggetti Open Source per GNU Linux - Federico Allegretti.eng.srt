1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
welcome back to project 42 today is thursday

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,899
but it is tuesday because we are recovering

3
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:11,429
that was we say the episode of

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,889
last thursday as a cause but that

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,389
we had some problems we

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,300
were not able to correctly record the

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,050
videos then I can immediately speak to

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,060
federico allegretti that  it was scheduled

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,929
with a talk on canvas and then to

10
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,929
federico

11
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:36,800
good evening good evening everyone i am

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,370
federico the secrets of terni unfortunately

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,530
transmitting the house the line in hyper the

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,000
wind

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,619
wirelessly last time there was bad weather and

16
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:54,229
play easy to maintain a stable connection

17
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:55,219


18
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:57,589
we hope that today it is peaceful things go

19
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:01,699
a little better I would say to

20
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:06,399
immediately start taking a look at the septum of

21
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:12,860
this talk so let's say so

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,500
what we will talk about today is an object-oriented

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,069
programming language but very

24
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:21,259
visual designed for the development of

25
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:24,200
applications in  very very fast times

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,850
it is called gambas three there was a version

27
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,060
of two but it is now discontinued wind but yes

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,240
we can talk about can  vas but in practice

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,019
it implies an exhausted leg and the

30
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:43,030
project is maintained by benoit minisini

31
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,590
I don't know let's say surely it should be

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,470
pronounced let's say with French languages

33
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,899
but it is not my foreign language dld

34
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,819
of preference so you will forgive me

35
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:59,140
if for pronounced but the project is

36
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,840
hosted on  sourceforge.net and if we go

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,419
to see in fact the gambas cipale site

38
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,560
which is leg

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,670
swatch puntonet we find all the news

40
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,459
the girl at the project the various releases

41
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,990
etc. etc. etc.

42
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,090


43
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,570


44
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,750
installation of the project

45
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,170
because you can obviously develop

46
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,270
compile the project from scratch and then

47
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,260
from the source or if you have little time

48
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,410
and you want to immediately go to

49
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,660
that speech will start programming there

50
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,980
are specific instructions for

51
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,980
many distributions in my

52
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,970
specific case reuse ubuntu and for a

53
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,610
boom  east now from any seen 16

54
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:10,190
04 and then insert the king voice three of the

55
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,000
team  of development tubs leg steam

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,600
leg stress and here and do

57
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,160
the update of the clothes and

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,800
install the narrow leg that

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,680
we will get all the let's say

60
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,500
most 99 percent of the objects needed

61
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,920
to leg to work the central heart

62
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,170
of the leg programming system

63
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,570
if  the idea that you can launch

64
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:47,930
just looking for a leg on the

65
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,530
command line but obviously the

66
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,540
distribution distribution

67
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,290
the thing changes the souk that

68
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,910
you will eventually get this the main sea or

69
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,600
spa screen of ideas allows us to

70
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,690
do many things but the thing that us

71
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,310
what interests us at this moment

72
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,570
is certainly to create let's go directly

73
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,690
to see how practically we can start

74
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,690
developing then cosina ings we can do

75
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,580
many things in the leg

76
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,540
more or less what is a series of

77
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:33,229
present that starts you projects and in the

78
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:37,280
leg those to whom we say  I am more

79
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,410
accustomed to the ones I use most often

80
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,840
these are the graphic applications

81
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,610
then the typical client applications

82
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,440
server in a corporate environment,

83
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,830
therefore interfacing with

84
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,850
database servers or exchanging

85
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,450
information between various programs that

86
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,130
are running on multiple machines

87
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,140
within the same

88
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,800
network,

89
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,169
nothing prevents that an application could have done

90
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:09,430
a line command lines

91
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,930
do  video games with a present that

92
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,260
is specifically addressed to

93
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,320
the use of sdl books or

94
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,500
web applications I would not go to look at

95
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,990
the web applications because they are

96
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,920
not dropped I never do it I

97
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,280
do not like them for strictly personal and

98
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,440
therefore there are long networks in that from

99
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,630
you people was one of the questions that

100
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,110
was asked in the latest version

101
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,240
someone asked him which web server is

102
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,380
best suited to interface

103
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:53,500
with gambas in principle he has to develop

104
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,320
a web server also directly inside

105
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,330
gambas but any type of web server in

106
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,450
that  can interface with

107
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,380
applications to escape the news rai

108
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,540
quietly can use a

109
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,480
progr  amma or a canvas application

110
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,510
as a server then as a server of

111
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,190
cda requests and then all in all in

112
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,640
the end to whatever the important thing

113
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,400
is that in the server machine that will follow

114
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,130
the cgia requests and there is the rag time

115
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,380
with the free and to execute code  cabas

116
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,360
let's go and see and now what is

117
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,090
the chorus I start this introductory part

118
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,400
of relative gambas the

119
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,610
graphic applications as you can see that there are

120
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,370
four big buttons between the divas to

121
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,880
graphic applications 2 that

122
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,290
expressly have of who it was and

123
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,340
gt that the version 2 and  version 3 and a

124
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,370
generic graphic the application and one

125
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,310
related to the e gloomy in practice because

126
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,220
because

127
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,590
the distribution distribution the look

128
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,970
and feel that you will get will be

129
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,920
different if you use the gt that the

130
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,220
votes sometimes there are also bugs

131
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,310
or strange behaviors that

132
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,350
occur using the gtk cuticles and

133
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,750
vice versa or that is resolved

134
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,820
using another very rare book

135
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,980
and are normally resolved abba

136
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,350
quickly this can happen if you

137
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,840
use the application as present

138
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,520
and therefore you do not

139
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,220
expressly know first which library you are

140
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,440
using and then sometimes if it does not

141
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,810
work you approve to convert the

142
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,340
project to the other one to see if the

143
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,190
problem is related to the libraries I

144
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,820
normally  qt application development

145
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,560
then we select our

146
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,080
application points we go ahead and we

147
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,820
come to where to save our project

148
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,220
will be the development folder of the project

149
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,030
itself

150
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,280
in practice it shows you your

151
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,680
folder the tree of your disk me and

152
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,880
you put them in the documents folder

153
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,490
or  after mans it is an oversight in the

154
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,650
interface is that in the beginning as

155
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,720
you can see there is nowhere in the south

156
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,140


157
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,020
a button to create a new

158
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,320
folder then in the end with experience

159
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,740
he knows it and just

160
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,500
do a right button  on the folder

161
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,440
where you want to graft the subfolder

162
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,059
of our project which creates a new

163
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:45,390
pro art  ject we put in here and

164
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,150
go we make the following

165
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,400
project name title the project while more

166
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,020
than the project can also be quite

167
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,690
explanatory and project test for

168
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,910
introna on canvas the project name

169
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,640
instead must be very concise and

170
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,340
cannot contain spaces so I would say

171
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:15,520
introna gambas  dop exceed but if we

172
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,180
put a space not bad

173
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,680
the leader tells us that in short we

174
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,420
can not use those

175
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,100
special characters let's put it anders shot and it is not

176
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,710
immediately our project

177
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,470
the object we serve a play does

178
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,950
nothing but render a window on the

179
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,260
screen with some properties  let's say by

180
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,800
default

181
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,150
in practice they are all there as if

182
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,660
you have the code associated with this

183
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,620
first object the parent jet of everything

184
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,040
as you can empty because because the

185
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,610
project all application

186
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,180
intrinsically generates as

187
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,530
a base object a forum main man that you see here

188
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:15,250
on the left of the  leader which is a

189
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,020
generic window so like all

190
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,260
windows at  possibility the possibility

191
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,710
of being resized minimized

192
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,300
maximizes or closed

193
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,560
obviously closing the

194
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,950
main object also sleeps the application

195
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,250
the property most of the ideas

196
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,590
of these owners can indeed

197
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,630
certainly most of these

198
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,150
properties can be modified by the

199
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,940
editor from the  leader and therefore for

200
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,820
example if we want to avoid that this

201
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:54,010
window can be reserved for dinner

202
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,600
we can do it by

203
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,470
modifying the owner and satiated the ball by

204
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:04,120
putting it in fox and we see that

205
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,350
our window

206
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,120
at this point can no longer be enlarged

207
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,280


208
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,580
the handles to resize automatically disappear

209
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,120


210
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,110
we could do the window itself

211
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,630
programmatically and for example we can

212
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,440
associate it with the opening event of

213
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,730
this window

214
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,070
what are the events associated with an

215
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,800
object in practice the trick is to

216
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,620
right-click on the object and how you could

217
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,040
see there  is an event menu item that

218
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
gives us a list of all events

219
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,780
associated with ours to our project

220
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,910
obviously this list of events

221
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,090
will change based on the object on which

222
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,880
we did use right we

223
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,470
say the open event and we had already

224
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,300
allocated them simply by double

225
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,420
clicking on the window but if we do the

226
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,220
star another  Once this

227
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,580
right button is turned and we go to look for

228
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,600
the event where it is no longer there

229
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,600
because we have removed it but track tv the open there is

230
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,790
a difference in this specific case

231
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,800
we do not care so much in the end both

232
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,480
will be launched and

233
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,500
trigari and  for example we can decide

234
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,710
we have put back the right jabal rendering

235
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,200
we can decide that at the

236
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,650
start phase the last man object no

237
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,320
longer has because in this case the property

238
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,440
is changed to tell it no longer has

239
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,100
the possibility of being resized

240
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,320
so test main in point and  so

241
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,630
we can already see one of the communities

242
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,700
one of the weee communities of the

243
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,300
slightly more advanced ide when we call

244
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,720
one of the objects point we get t  all

245
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,510
the properties related to this object or

246
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,520
that could be the way this

247
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,890
object what we were interested in was

248
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,970
made of ball

249
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,310
so if you are lazy or do

250
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,690
not care what was the property of the

251
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,100
object

252
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,690
you can see it here and then we get

253
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,470
a l  'auto completion of the code and at

254
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:36,589
this point we put it to maybe it is also

255
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:39,730
in this case the leader helps

256
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,830
us by giving us feedback on the fact that

257
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,800
we have written well but if we send at

258
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,860
this point as you can see there is no

259
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,890
longer the possibility to modify the

260
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,300
size of the window but

261
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,830
simply because the

262
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,080
inter system subsystem

263
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,420
the gambas interpreter launches the

264
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,680
project launches the program renders

265
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,390
the image at the moment of the

266
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,370
window when this

267
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,700
forum realizes that you want to remove

268
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,760
the confidentiality property and removes it

269
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,020
we can also take this thing a

270
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,610
little nicer for example

271
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,580
we can put a button on ours

272
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,930
on our screen and put it  and a button

273
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,040
here but we love you leave a button

274
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:38,290
one by one yes and we make another

275
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:47,800
against the circus antro v9 they are called

276
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,210
button 1 button two it is not

277
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,710
really good practice to leave the names so

278
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,520
in short, of self-generation of the objects

279
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,620
on the screen for  our

280
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,690
specific case is just to have fun

281
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,480
we can also modify it to I want to

282
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,490
make something we do live yes no now

283
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,380
suppose we want to make the

284
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:17,350
window sensitive when we press yes

285
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,400
against the past

286
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,710
against the group and instead becomes weighs 0

287
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:36,170
the false when we press  no and instead

288
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,170
we make it not made ball ball at the

289
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:45,560
start we throw it and as you can

290
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,680
see and at the start it does not make ball if we

291
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,720
think yes

292
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,930
at this point the safe window of

293
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,560
san zeno can be resized with no

294
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,380
we cannot resize the lines

295
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,380
we have already seen  how to make two

296
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,930
or rather three objects

297
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,600
interact with another object that contains them

298
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,140


299
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,570
and what is a pretty nice thing

300
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,630
obtained with three lines of  the code what

301
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,220
he wants to show to another of the

302
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,500
communities you have seen the button

303
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,610
relating to yes it is called throw 1 if at

304
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,830
this point we wanted to change the

305
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,110
name of the button to make it conform

306
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:36,080
to the thief and the yen is a boot yes leader

307
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,770
to this  point changes the code

308
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,800
related to the events related to the

309
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,270
button but on one that is now I throw

310
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,150
a yes by changing all the references

311
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,290
to the object so quite comfortable we do not

312
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,600
have to worry about reciprocating

313
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,170
all the references to the button and

314
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,760
we have done things quite

315
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,770
simple times but all in all  in the

316
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,069
end it already knows very very powerful to

317
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,890
make 90 percent of the applications

318
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,770
we work with every day

319
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,869
standard objects that arrive as books

320
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:15,560
and standards to allocate for the project

321
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,550
so for qt applications there are

322
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:23,930
buttons lei ball textbox slider tango

323
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,890
button

324
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,890
etcetera etcetera there are

325
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,700
gridview the isthmus we say to ourselves more or less almost

326
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:37,670
any kind of

327
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,130
visual object  zzatore that interests us that they are

328
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:46,730
closed by color by date etc. and

329
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,560
container or frame vertical

330
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,400
pane etc.

331
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,800
let's say that slowly with the use

332
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,010
you will surely find out what you

333
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,140
need to do what you need

334
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,470
the timers very useful for making

335
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,910
applications that can

336
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,580
at the same time follow more

337
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,510
background things and certainly the

338
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,150
most interesting thing about the leg if the rich

339
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,260
supply of objects or components that

340
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,270
can allow you to do many many

341
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,590
other things one word I would like to show you

342
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:29,360
from time to time the possibility of

343
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,540
having a library related to the  '

344
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:38,800
database access and at this point the database

345
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,120
can be different then but be

346
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,350
but they are those post secular bbc

347
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:51,830
and if we ever put sql ok the more or

348
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,600
less we have calls to

349
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,040
ham the functions related to the

350
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,440
use of corn sequel

351
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,570
if we only put bim  and sql

352
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,430
automatically he who will also put

353
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,080
the art library for karja action

354
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,540
and at this point if we go to  see the

355
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,990
components

356
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:16,249
ebi non s heart here it is and he also put the

357
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:18,849
point of b which is the class it

358
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:23,239
seems what interests us what I

359
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:26,080
would like to show you instead is a

360
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,109
quite nice violin game

361
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:35,929
which is interfacing with istreamer and

362
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:37,820
therefore with the  dg streamer multimedia library

363
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,340
to show you that really

364
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,109
in a few clicks you can do

365
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:44,479
even quite complex things that

366
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:47,710
normally would have required

367
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,249
much more is a lot of code in almost

368
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:55,539
all programming languages

369
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,710
let's say mainstream an aside

370
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,109
some users had the other

371
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:05,269
time  asked if there was gambas for

372
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:06,019
windows

373
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:09,619
no there is no leg on windows i think you

374
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:11,809
can compile or try to compile

375
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:18,710
gambas using the subsystem

376
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,159
i don't remember it's called the one that allows you

377
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:24,999
to compile linux sources on i

378
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:28,009
will wear i do not guarantee that it works

379
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:30,499
natively we are there and you have

380
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:34,249
seen on the supported platforms on

381
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:37,389
his outlet that there is no wi  ndows

382
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:40,460
for the match all in all being

383
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,039
freebsd below maybe there is some

384
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,440
more possibility but my mom senate

385
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,109
on linux is definitely linux of

386
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:49,989
the reference platform

387
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:53,419
we put the related objects to

388
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,460
register and then in fact

389
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,759
a milia stage appeared which down at the bottom where

390
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:04,309
there is a media object the more we try to

391
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:08,089
make a small application with media

392
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:10,820
more then for example we can put

393
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:16,399
a button to open a content to

394
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:20,210
play seeds for itself

395
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,830
forgive me the gate these other

396
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,060
projects

397
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:28,110
for this example we do not need and

398
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,670
we also remove them from here and media view

399
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,170
allows us to do quite

400
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,950
nice things as you saw when I

401
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,950
pressed media below and

402
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,070
a little something appeared in practice a kind of

403
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,320
online help that allows us to have

404
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,650
a small description of what it

405
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:55,290
is  the object we are raving about and here

406
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,970
says this class implements a small

407
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:01,830
media a simple media player

408
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:06,030
control or in its controls  but let's see more in

409
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,240
practice for example if one of the

410
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,560
properties of the medieval subject rl and if

411
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,130
we here select a video for

412
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:23,270
example and launch the project

413
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:31,430
automatically he loads the

414
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,550
project the video in question which was

415
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,770
simply a screen capture of

416
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,510
some of some time  ago

417
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,040
as you can see there are all the

418
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,180
typical controls of a media

419
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,870
player and therefore the possibility to go

420
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,780
back and forth to pause or

421
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,790
stop the movie and to change the audio of

422
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,160
ways to modify the audio volume

423
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,630
these properties are  editable also

424
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,850
at runtime for example this button 2

425
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,430
we can click and say that

426
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:17,130
mary a bio 1 point

427
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,520
on the point

428
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,110
the idea was to send it to full

429
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,090
screen

430
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:37,010
I do not think there is instead no there is no

431
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:43,350
moncia there is not or at least not  I

432
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:50,660
remember it well

433
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,290
let's make it botton two we transform it into

434
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:05,510
an open file file I call it the property

435
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,780
ask the user to click on an

436
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,900
open file button to select the

437
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,890
video to play

438
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,080
then we associate to the click of botton two

439
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,460
it tells it we make a

440
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:31,890
string path variable then we say that the

441
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:40,280
path path is the same dialog

442
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,800
dialog and a native object

443
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:55,070
of the interpreter open file file and that's it

444
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,149
and then we make it as

445
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:15,659
beautiful as gradually a point

446
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:23,159
l the same path  if we launch

447
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,960
the application it no longer goes into play that is it

448
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,360
does not immediately load the

449
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,500
content by itself but if they call you in the file it

450
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,240
gives us the possibility to choose where to

451
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,809
go to look for our content and

452
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:43,210
as you can see you do nothing because

453
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:49,240
because in reality I was  it returns you if

454
00:25:49,240 --> 00:26:02,880
there was an error then night was born

455
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:10,149
to ok ok and there are some errors

456
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:12,100
let's see another of the

457
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,840
interesting features of the VAT

458
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,230
or the possibility of

459
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:21,760
debugging then let's put f9 of the bo

460
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,940
of the stop birch  and let's see what

461
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,590
happens during the tape the execution

462
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,190
of the program let's blaine let's press and

463
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:35,350
we are already here path is empty ok so it

464
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,690
is quite compatible with the fact  or

465
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,250
that we have allocated the variable as

466
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:46,029
soon as we are choosing one of

467
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:49,630
a movie we select it and at this

468
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,740
point we go to see what it is

469
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:56,520
error path

470
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:01,860
did not open it

471
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:08,910
we pass bug patrons it has traveled

472
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:17,039
so at least we have the other point of

473
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:34,620
path is still empty to true sorry

474
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:42,640
because it is wrong so you wrote wrong

475
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,120
precisely because the

476
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,190
dialogue ben file function does not return

477
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,460
the apat of the file but establishes if it is

478
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,940
too much perhaps it has been opened or closed at

479
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,330
this point instead we have to ask and

480
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,840
put in the  variable path your

481
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:09,100
own from the dialog's pub and now if

482
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,178
we go to see in fact

483
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,250
at this point there is still nothing

484
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:25,480
but dialogue point hit the right path

485
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,840


486
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,650
we go on the path

487
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,670
actually this there was no

488
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,580
error so path is the right one and

489
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,220
we put it in the media property of 1

490
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:44,429
point rl and at this point we have the

491
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:47,410
media player ready to

492
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,290
reproduce our contribution which is

493
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,400
black however the audio is heard and we choose

494
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,970
another if at this point we want to

495
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,510
remove all these watchmen was

496
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,590
watch and go with them always

497
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:11,280
phenomena we remove them we take this

498
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:18,580
ocher we look for section and as you can

499
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,860
see we have a peaceful one we will have to

500
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:25,179
bring this we have made a

501
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:27,460
small  a small media player

502
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,500
we have seen how to put the watched

503
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,170
stop watchers to

504
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,030
debug our code online

505
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,760
we have seen how to load a few

506
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:48,130
objects to do some

507
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,070
more nice jobs and I would say that maybe

508
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,290
I don't know if we

509
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,520
have arrived we have  time is over or not I don't

510
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,950
realize yes we have reached the

511
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,760
time limit we are fine in the sense

512
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,929
that then these productions and we do

513
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:11,510
simply to give inspiration

514
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,480
to people so I think that if a

515
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,250
person wants to deepen he goes to

516
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:21,169
look for things  in a way but then someone if

517
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:21,500
you want to

518
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,440
close with those two questions that

519
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,570
were asked by users for

520
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,149
a  rriva all'asl at sea life lab that

521
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:33,409
comic lazarus pascal and that how

522
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:35,990
the code is distributed then fast of the

523
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,179
thief spa scale number I know so

524
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:41,120
I can not tell you if better or worse than

525
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,630
gambas would certainly not make an

526
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,779
answer not a date as

527
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,210
regards  the distribution of the

528
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,549
code of your application then you can

529
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:56,059
simply create the executable of

530
00:30:56,059 --> 00:31:00,140
your project and distribute this

531
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,640
intro leg cue gambas however this

532
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,549
means that in the other machine where

533
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:11,659
you will run this application there

534
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:14,990
must be at least the drian

535
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,630
low runtime and the libraries that  you have

536
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,350
used

537
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,140
or you can create an

538
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,440
installation package and the installation package the

539
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,549
installation package utility

540
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:30,890
allows you to create a

541
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,470
package containing everything you need

542
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,419
to deploy your

543
00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:37,370
application on the machine or

544
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:40,130
machines of your

545
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,659
partners of your customers  your

546
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:45,710
friends can choose license there is the

547
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,810
possibility  lity seems to me

548
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,750
I almost never even there indicate

549
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,310
which distribution you are

550
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,480
going to put to distribute

551
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,430
the application in this way let's say it

552
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,070
makes the application more compatible

553
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,410
from distribution to distribution

554
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:07,850
it seems to me that we have said everything thank you very

555
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,030
much  if you want to give references on

556
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,240
how the penalty hit anyway on your

557
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,890
look of reference linux user group and

558
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,520
linux user group of terni and my email

559
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:29,060
I attach faith gmail.com and in any case they

560
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,580
can also be reached on display and where I have

561
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,540
most of my projects  which

562
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:43,210
are often developed on skilled efforts

563
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:50,060
and for example one is this or 20v

564
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,280
architecture which serves precisely to

565
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,500
manage a multichannel multiplex of

566
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,840
television with a single client for

567
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,300
the insertion of contents and the

568
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,490
management of the various channels is a

569
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,090
similar thing area and  related instead to the

570
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,490
world of radio always on his

571
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,470
effort so if you are looking for me on his

572
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,760
effort or look for how tv architecture

573
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,770
developed by hig  h end trader strange and

574
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,620
here you will find everything and my

575
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,160
my my applications and you can

576
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,040
contact me safely then

577
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,650
thank you very much for your availability and

578
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,080
for sharing your experience with us

579
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,890
thank you thank you for

580
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,370
the hospitality
