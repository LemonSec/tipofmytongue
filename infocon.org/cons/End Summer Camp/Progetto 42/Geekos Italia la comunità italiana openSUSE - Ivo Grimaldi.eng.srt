1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,340
ok then I wanted to do the pilot of

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,000
starting to tell you exactly what it is and what

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,170
sense does it still have now to maintain the

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,780
community especially on telegram of

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,710
gicos italia starting from my story

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,730
of where I come from and why I started

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,289
giving linux and that it turned around done for

8
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,940
getting to need this community

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,400
practically since 2000 and I

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,289
always started using the nous 2000 and I knew

11
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:36,609
almost nothing so I had a hard time

12
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:38,620
installing any distribution

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,179
because not knowing even the

14
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:42,159
technical terms and especially in a vill

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,859
internet is a task of sight  between read

16
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:48,120
all or it is difficult to be able to

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,710
install linux

18
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,530
in 2006 an ubuntu distribution arrived

19
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,319
that comes from

20
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:58,869
automobiles for the installation and

21
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:00,100
then finally I can do an

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,949
installation in a very short time to buy

23
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:04,330
than that computer licola in

24
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,110
an hour  left washes linux and i had the

25
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,320
feeling now or linux so i

26
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,110
'm okay and i'm not going to move to

27
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,150
other distribuz  ions because ubuntu

28
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,040
quickly made me install so it is

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,260
stable then time I started

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,880
wanting to learn some music some

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,430
graphics some software are not up to

32
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,320
date and so I need

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,080
libreoffice

34
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,820
at the time there was still open office more

35
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,510
updated

36
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,290
I need to have the latest version of

37
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,150
mozilla firefox is instead free and the

38
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,790
older one to derubricare and on walls

39
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,330
towards ubuntu shores you put links to

40
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,600
sardines launch pads that have the

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,790
possibility of having more updated software and

42
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,400
the thing I noticed is  that

43
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,850
having 30 and serving a year teams all

44
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,950
behind the list of repositories between

45
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,960
them were in conflict with the

46
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,620
libraries and therefore every tot type the mega

47
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,870
for mere six months and began to

48
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,669
grow a bit everything and there is and

49
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,830
we should never format the  fifth at 0

50
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,600
so I did not have a way of being able to

51
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,840
have a stable system to say from

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,720
now on in the lighthouse because in the space of six

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,320
months

54
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,330
I was more or less able to get back on my

55
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,730
feet the person I had before  then for

56
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,160
some reason unknown to me it grew

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,730
because I want to try a newer thing

58
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,050
I can't go back

59
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,780
because that to a newer party I

60
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,430
can't bring the clean package to the side it

61
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,720
grows me to the whole system

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,350
formed and reinstalls so the

63
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,160
alternatives are  been in the last few years

64
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,550
and those to try to move suisse

65
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,450
ubuntu because xfce seemed to

66
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,300
mess up if less ok I was missing

67
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,570
something but I tried to move to kde

68
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,410
neon and also I was missing something that

69
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,900
belongs to a was much more and is

70
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,690
still in development  e was stuck

71
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,930
boasted and about many things

72
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,750
then five years ago more or less I was

73
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,200
returning to youtube a tool which I had

74
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,470
already configured as I was interested contact me

75
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,030


76
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,080


77
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,360
via internet  itas a lot I want more

78
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,820
in a group I bring us was born deals

79
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,170
with the technical information of this

80
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,830
distribution so I care years ago but

81
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,690
you have installed it I would have done f  at the

82
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:43,989
end of the day

83
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:47,019
I didn't even have to be installed yet and

84
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,739
I miss it pupils the cascin on dropbox

85
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,560
so I had under the sub a tumor in

86
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,650
my mind above the new thomas indro box and I

87
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,480
did it for three months that I gave her assistance to the

88
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,980
group of people who came in to do the

89
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,380
installation  going into dropbox

90
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,660
then certain point I said is the system

91
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,549
is growing me because mine for three I

92
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,620
can't understand why I can't go

93
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,480
to the ubuntu desktop

94
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,459
but if I'm inside my dropbox

95
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,940
with and open susa is working for me

96
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,050
then what did I do  I said one day

97
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,080
format and I put the system directly

98
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,170
the laptop nothing from that day I

99
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,450
have no longer formatted importable because

100
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,510
over five years and I am left with the laptop

101
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,700
with the versions of these people per

102
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,300
day

103
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,419
and this made me understand that ok is a

104
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:44,840
solution  solid distribution is a

105
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,710
coherent distribution then we will also see what

106
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,389


107
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,229
the camcorder coffin tends to for coherence of the distribution

108
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,129
the interesting thing is that in the group

109
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:02,349
that abb  we decided to create on telegram

110
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:04,569
at the beginning it was thought only

111
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,129
these users enter we give them

112
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:08,469
basic information to make installations which now

113
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:10,389
finished the installation these will be

114
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:12,669
users who can by themselves maybe

115
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:15,449
come out of the wolf

116
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,330
and arranging for cabbage them instead the

117
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,330
thing that has us  left a little amazed is

118
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,740
that the telegram group enters in

119
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,710
that the minimal information to do

120
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,550
the installation when it has installed does not

121
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,789
leave the group because it has not only had

122
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:38,129
the information from there the administrators

123
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:44,159
can not from and in the sense that lately

124
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:47,719
there is  and 23 guys who have had

125
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:52,349
experiences on video cards with buoys

126
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:54,300
those who are on import africa in

127
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,169
italy is an nvidia inside and one

128
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:01,319
even broke the boxes and

129
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,800
compiled some software that was then

130
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,289
put on an official software that

131
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:09,449
it is called suse prime and then exits does the

132
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:12,839
switch of the video card and from in Italy

133
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,969
to the media without having to restart the

134
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:15,539
computer

135
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,039
so being the expert of those

136
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,599
cards when in the tram user that to

137
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:21,870
those needs at pleasure to

138
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,639
answer him and give him all the

139
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,949
support possible so what I

140
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,710
have had feedback from users

141
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,139
who enter is that it is not a community

142
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,839
as I have heard many say at the moment

143
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,899
in the forum or  in the ubuntu charts

144
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:40,110
where there are more than a thousand people as soon as

145
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,089
I ask a question that is burnt for them

146
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:44,879
the fund loved that reading

147
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,279
these pages on the internet but sorry because

148
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,529
cyclical and second that are trivial and for

149
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:52,139
us instead there is nothing trivial

150
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,629
because there is what he sells from windows

151
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:56,580
so he has no experience

152
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,789
asking us what a terminal there is what

153
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:02,279
he comes from so the

154
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,339
similarities between what he did with

155
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,319
ubuntu and what he would like to do here so

156
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,629
some codes can say yes the  do it in

157
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,959
this other way some other we are not

158
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,479
going to do them because here it is not expected or

159
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,699
to do it and so there is a

160
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,880
completely different solution dictionary

161
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,760
the community is just the fact that a

162
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,460
pe  riodo that it was like Trevisi not even

163
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,860
that many users entered inside

164
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,090
I started to tell everyone

165
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,880
please don't do the [ __ ]

166
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,080
spread around that we want to

167
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,120
let users in because I don't care about

168
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,310
the number and there is a talk we said

169
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,690
you  that you are interested in having an

170
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,360
adequate number of people who enter c

171
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,730
from b that is, it is not mandatory that

172
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,080
we have what Milan and the users in

173
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,090
rather in this period that does not see

174
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,570
people we try to structure ourselves to

175
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,020
say

176
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,569
which is a standard that we can thus

177
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:58,629
give  the basic user who enters wants to

178
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:02,379
try open susa is the thing that now

179
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,169
I will show you three very simple things the

180
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,270
basis that this distribution that

181
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,250
distinguishes it from all the

182
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,949
others which makes it solid in the sense that it is

183
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,250
impossible to clear it to

184
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,770
bomb it having to say  I have to format because

185
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,020
there is always a way to go back and

186
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,120
restore everything even without

187
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,349
internet access and even without access to the

188
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:27,400
graphical interface

189
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,849
then the first thing to say is that for

190
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:32,130
those who are expert in linux

191
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,870
the first thing that one of the first things

192
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,640
that fear us when it is installed

193
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,679
asks which is the filesystem to

194
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,679
install open on visa proposes by

195
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,399
default and tr flash which is a  file

196
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,990
system

197
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,880
in the other distributions little

198
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,329
used and a default link vtr

199
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:56,200
parties of open susa plus another

200
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,510
related technology which are the gis shot

201
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,700
and it works in this way

202
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,579
today a day two seconds before

203
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:05,529
updating the system the

204
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,510
operating system alone is technique  notice it

205
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,640
creates a slapshot there is a save

206
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,300
the whole system and puts it in the list

207
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,310
in the grab at startup in order of date

208
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,650
and when the update is finished I

209
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,250
restarted if the restart is decreed

210
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,380
created successful in auto brand mini I

211
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,980
did a  another step to close

212
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,930
the update grateful to mourinho and the

213
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,700
actions are the difference between

214
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,720
the installation first installation after

215
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,520
let's say launched very quickly

216
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,430
and the interesting thing  is that it can

217
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,950
happen that one makes a mistake and maybe you

218
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,120
download the dredging of the owner

219
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,890
of the nvidia card model different

220
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,490
from his puts it on and because maybe

221
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,020
he didn't know he had gt because maybe

222
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,180
because I know that heck model a and

223
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,700
installing naba you install smith and on the

224
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,860
carnet  when the system starts

225
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,790


226
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,670
the driver preceding the video card has been elevated and it

227
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,310
is tried to start the

228
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,800
tv card drivers or wrong say by

229
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,180
having wrong for the video card

230
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,120
so users is on foot

231
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,250
then in this case here is the

232
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,010
possibility to go to the grab video the

233
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,930
next previous I go back

234
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,220
thirty seconds and I am already in the

235
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,350
precise version of having done the update

236
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,810
and or the usual my problem

237
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,730
another thing that you did see and

238
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,640
heavy vico ii last then in

239
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,470
hockey on da  there is a panel

240
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,160
called the

241
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,540
administrator lipid hosts towards this

242
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,700
panel it is next to here on my right

243
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,040
I put a magnifying glass to

244
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,760
let you see

245
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,209
certainly give the entries because you can't

246
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:58,000
read them all and I find it interesting

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,310
that this panel has everything you

248
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,970
need to set the operating system

249
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,339
from safety how many snap shots

250
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:08,620
I want to keep if maybe or small disk

251
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,589
and then I want to keep 5 is the sixth

252
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:16,060
delete everything  and how to set up the

253
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,560
repositories how to set up things or

254
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,980
more specifics for systems engineers like auto

255
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,740
yast me with figures a pc as god

256
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,300
commands then i go to introduce the

257
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,310
auspices cover them posted clips of this

258
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,220
pc and replicate them for all pc that

259
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,310
will have installed here susa  as a client

260
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,320
and they will already have all the settings whose

261
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,519
list is the season plus

262
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,220
software configurations installed but the software

263
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,500
already does the outlast system so I do

264
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,240
n't know clone the one of the re disk row

265
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,930
or do many installations and pass out

266
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,810
to reinstall everything now stalled

267
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,130
his done I wrote it marina of

268
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,810
what I had to install so

269
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,140
everything is already set here the other thing that

270
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,070
is  revolutionary on or for the success of

271
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,920
pro apposta firefox

272
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:15,259
here is one thing that is interesting

273
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:17,779
we see to users who enter

274
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,809
into open susa and do not find your

275
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:21,829
program

276
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:23,629
ok because when I installed for the

277
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:27,289
south with the cai you only have the repositories of

278
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:31,689
defaults that contain

279
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:34,609
free software not proprietary and

280
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,619
leading software out there the packages

281
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:39,529
of the repositories the leaves are few and

282
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:42,349
are not specific for the music of the

283
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:46,089
graphics for which for education

284
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:50,109
the educational now I write that arises

285
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:53,109
search

286
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,640
her

287
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,230
download or for sud and opensuse search

288
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,559
here it is then there is something

289
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,569
that is revolutionary called but no

290
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:05,610
this is the meaning of the home page id

291
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,290
opensuse build service

292
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,709
here it is this here that is open susa to

293
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:14,699
a mega server called ubs and  it is not

294
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:18,870
a bit bs studio it is open build service

295
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,269
inside all the users of

296
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:23,999
obe susa and also the developers

297
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:27,209
can create their 3 place and comes

298
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:31,410
for example there

299
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,309
is no what is spotify i create the

300
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:38,850
spotify package for open susa but the beauty is that you

301
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,990
create the package by saying this is the

302
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,020
source guitar

303
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,390
and I link it to this server the

304
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,680
best place there the compilation of the

305
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,850
package is done by the server and checks he

306
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,670
never said he wants to make people laugh

307
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,470
compatible with this program for the

308
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,560
current version that is 15 1

309
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,840
the version that will arrive in July there is the

310
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,880
here says between two then there is I will play

311
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,010
healing create the tabloid it is also

312
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,890
the limit ok putting the flags in the

313
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:16,370
right places and the serves  does the check and me

314
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,150
and himself the package is compatible and ideas

315
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,190
to all the dependencies for the three verse

316
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,230
liter chosen if

317
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,190
the package is usable what

318
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,030
I write spotify

319
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,910
from I try

320
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,920
not to see ok cohabits places all the

321
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,440
servers that have spotify inside for

322
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,850
example

323
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,699
wikimedia up spotify deezer and pm

324
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:44,589
what I gave for the installation and

325
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:48,550
then from here 8 nov to see the server

326
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,050
in server stalls that is by clicking on the

327
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,910
server that is a technology called

328
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,240
on  and click that automatically opens the

329
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,069
list of repositories puts

330
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:03,430
inside itself the deposit we have chosen knows

331
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,680
which program to install it

332
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,560
refreshes the list of repositories and the

333
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,209
programs that are inside them and

334
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,519
installs the program and therefore the

335
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,990
system and  the package is self installed on the web

336
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,660
and it was fantastic these

337
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,940
weight packages destiny in various

338
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,670
deposits can be present in more than one

339
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,069
cost so the only a little

340
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:29,649
studied something called priority and for

341
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:31,930
whom a brochure was there and there is

342
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,399
there should still be pinging

343
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,560
and because I am like you possible by

344
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,600
giving the right priorities alien then

345
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,290
falconer I can say take a package from

346
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,540
that repository rather than another

347
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,149
so if I know that the packages are

348
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,649
older in the system

349
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,810
I have put in repository of  multimedia

350
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,279
because it will give me the newest packages of the

351
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,769
hour priority to a p mib so that it

352
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,490
will come to take the buffs from the last and

353
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,500
not from the oldest ones that are inside

354
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,399
the repositories  ry standard and all this

355
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,019
works I am amazed that other

356
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,339
systems have not copied this

357
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:15,399
technology because all opel so it

358
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,390
can do very well from

359
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,120
that other institutions could

360
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,640
apply the same technology and we would not

361
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,550
get angry and then to say it all

362
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,880
his and many people do not know  opensuse

363
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,070
but it is new in reality it is not new

364
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,970
because the open suda derives from a

365
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,730
situation that would now come to

366
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,830
mind the name but I have an

367
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,680
interested image I download immediately and vera pulled

368
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,040
out one of the first distributions in the

369
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,430
assumption that was created

370
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,290
between now  it is the water drain a moment

371
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,790
that I find it immediately here it is then

372
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,779
I save

373
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:03,000
on the oviesse ok then here I close on the abs

374
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,430
I will have the limbs trips on the fa here I open the

375
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,240
full screen

376
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,540
ok and you see them a little better here it is

377
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,650
the guard

378
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,470
the name excuse me  then the lawsuit but

379
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,760
of the very first distributions

380
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,640
ever is the fleeting still works

381
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,910
still maintained I still think by

382
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,410
only one developer so it is a  bit slow

383
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,360
in development

384
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,400
the interesting thing is that here you see

385
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,080
suse susa ignorant

386
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,570
from here

387
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:43,110
take opensuse but I guarantee you that in

388
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,840
July they merge the two kings placed

389
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,570
the suse ok merged for one thing that

390
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,299
now makeshift of the last three minutes

391
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:54,480
we have noticed that many  users a little

392
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,950
savvy at a corporate level also

393
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,100
tried for susa because I wanted to understand

394
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,950
if it could go well as needed at

395
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,370
a company level it is fine in the end

396
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,039
when I have made the figurations if

397
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,590
we want to pass people with

398
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,379
the assistance then open susa and the

399
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:17,320
free one without  susa assistance and from

400
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,929
assistance you can pay depending on the

401
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:22,149
type of assistance you want

402
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:25,419
nicotra suffered 4 pay more

403
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:27,399
working hours pay less they had to

404
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:31,259
format the server and reinstall and

405
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:35,169
with the face that contained the

406
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:39,399
susa repositories because they were in a bit different as it

407
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:43,389
was and  repository formations instead of the

408
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:46,929
change they will make of 15 number 15 23

409
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:50,019
then tris of the good from the same source

410
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:52,509
so just cam  name the king

411
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:55,690
removed from within the operating system already

412
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,720
installed make a crest of

413
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,210
the port list ii and maybe launch a

414
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,360
stop of time to see if any

415
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,658
package

416
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,480
to update or to go back

417
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,600
with respect to the version entrusted because

418
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,880
the versions rendered by the e  obviously it

419
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,090
could be a bit more conservative

420
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,659
and in any case it does not format before

421
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:24,980
this is the nice thing the thing I

422
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,600
like that people have entered

423
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,340
saying that this reason what I

424
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,650
say to myself I do not install it I think I

425
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,840
have no intention of saving it but I hear

426
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,860
about  in this group

427
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,799
ivo seems like the fan boy of open susa

428
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,289
who seems to be the top the stem I know

429
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:42,720
why when something likes there is

430
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,830
something I struggle sebastiano he

431
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,049
likes land summer camp so much and therefore it is obvious that

432
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:52,590
if you vary with him often  is you think at that

433
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,210
time that they are how we will do it

434
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,789
and we will do it we will physically do it to

435
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:59,370
him he would do it ue reduced and it is right

436
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,260
that he talks about it because it is what he

437
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,200
is at  heart talks about it and so i'm done

438
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,090
too i was gave her that she enters because she

439
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,399
wants to understand the dynamics how to then

440
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:11,928
maybe live that sucks

441
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,470
ok I ended up predicting that sucks he says a

442
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,020
lot that this is version of yoox and very

443
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,330
cool and that in the group we are all

444
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,460
curly  and then you go inside we slaughter each other

445
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,039
and when a user manages to

446
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,130
make the system work you throw him

447
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,470
out because you don't want to give

448
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,080
assistance it has never happened in fact it has never

449
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,419
happened to people who at the beginning like

450
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,049
me went machine and  after i did i

451
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:41,909
find them a computer is stalled because i

452
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:47,100
think it has an added value having

453
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,070
said that i ran out of minutes and 30

454
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,450
seconds more that i wanted to say

455
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,120
at the end

456
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,360
this evening is an evening that i

457
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,120
thought on purpose forerunner because why

458
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,440
life the  amazing anticipation as I

459
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,470
said that there is or bs you need and you

460
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,559
can create them there ad hoc

461
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,740
for certain

462
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,150
needs of the users of my group

463
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,280
musicians have decided to create a

464
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,480
deposit for themselves  c to put

465
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,450
musical stops in it

466
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,300
not only also to put in all

467
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,430
those facilities that allows you to

468
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:35,660
create open sweats for the authors of the

469
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,150
configuration of the whole system to

470
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:38,900
make music

471
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,200
because whoever tried it took more to

472
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,390
install jack then I had to

473
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,980
configure it in a certain  so look at

474
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:51,830
the legacy guides of the logs because if you do not

475
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,140
set it it does not work instead the

476
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,200
settings here are all

477
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,180
preconfigured install and pre-

478
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,130
configured by and by all

479
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,120
working

480
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,280
so next week

481
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,080
the super mega technicians will arrive who will shoot me

482
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,440
[ __ ] because elected [ __ ] today and

483
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,210
therefore city network also the

484
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,400
digital sector as it was as it is going

485
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,480
a thank you very much in a put to bed

486
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,270
because sometimes interesting so

487
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:28,490
we hope precisely that being at the

488
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,380
production center then they will still be

489
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,100
followed as we said related to the

490
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,680
other sub-project and your

491
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,630
community and  after they are already as they

492
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,460
are said the time of the questions so

493
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,270
we have a  Still time until 9.30pm

494
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:55,190
if anyone has any questions to ask there

495
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,830
was one in chat which is rarely asked a

496
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,390
question but from the observation on the

497
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,500
pronunciation on susa you operate susa

498
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,750
then if you want I can show you if a

499
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,730
video of a programmer who  he said

after installing you have to follow the

551
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,700
guides that have been revised

552
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,789

a finger the guide tell me where you are lost

554
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,020
