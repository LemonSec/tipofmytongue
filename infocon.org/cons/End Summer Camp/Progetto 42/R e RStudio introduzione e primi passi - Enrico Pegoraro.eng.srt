1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,300
here we are where you hello everyone I have

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,460
already been introduced so in any case I do not

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,010
have much to say write me anyway I

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,230
am a statistician I was born

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,559
as a statistician

6
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:17,630
since I graduated

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,119
I graduated in statistics and

8
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:22,460
luckily I am doing in mine  life

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,550
what I studied for so my

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,949
working life is precisely that

11
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:31,970
of the numbers as I say often it seems

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,130
the statistician to work for p and

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,230
try to make promotions from these

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,640
data

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,610
after a certain number of years in which I have not used it

16
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,340
was also because not  existed after

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:43,870
we will see it

18
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,060
I started in the last 15 years

19
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,960
abundant together with the company of which

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,210
I was a partner started working

21
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,640
with eras that precisely software

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,440
we will talk about today passed immediately to the

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,760
presentation let's see a little it will go a little

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,399
hug also because I got out I don't know if

25
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:07,969
I see  of what indeed sorry I do

26
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:11,719
something quick and then I also put my

27
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:14,869
timer on that so but I know that there are

28
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:17,689
so here are those today  i will try to

29
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:19,689
talk about rs to introduce

30
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:22,429
field is nothing more than a programming language

31
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:24,530
that was created by

32
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,670
statisticians for statisticians just

33
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,319
to do their own analysis of the data

34
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,499
therefore statisticians have been conceived

35
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:35,569
this to its then its cons in the sense

36
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:37,939
of  as I like to say we statisticians

37
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,560
have the services we like chaos a bit

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,130
statistical purposes

39
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,649
we are not used to giving different names

40
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:47,810
so the same in which they are so different is

41
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,369
one of the reasons why statistics are

42
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:52,429
often difficult but beyond

43
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:55,009
that and also a  po to this bad

44
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,200
habit, that is, cia of the

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,789
characteristics for which we see that it

46
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:01,520
was not born to inform us, however, a

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,959
programming shop is very

48
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,810
efficient for data analysis for

49
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,670
graphical representation etc.

50
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,630
etc.

51
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,758
in any case what we will see today

52
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:13,760
we will see a little  of history on r a bit of

53
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,180
features dr himself let's see a bit

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,390
how to interact with eras using studio but

55
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,610
we will see that substantially  and

56
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,459
referential leather which has now become the

57
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,799
de facto standard for analysis

58
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,890
for analysis with r we will therefore see some

59
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,099
code is just on the fly and after a while

60
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:38,959
tell if the graphic pd and indeed then

61
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,180
quickly pro with the story of r

62
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,549
then it was  an implementation of a

63
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:45,470
programming language that was born

64
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,730
in 76 by john chambers was the creator

65
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,720
in the beautiful and basically

66
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,519
a cold implementation of this

67
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,170
software of this programming language

68
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,609


69
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:01,730
let's say that r as now it

70
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,040
still runs almost that is it can run almost

71
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,560
without problems  code they still dated

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,690
in 1976

73
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,599
therefore it is very linked to this structure

74
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,329
and was designed for data analysis

75
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:17,060
as as such

76
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,780
in 81

77
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,389
source codes of this s were made available in 88

78
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:25,639
they spread we say that it is better they

79
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,220
were  applied the many changes to

80
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,849
its syntax and producing in us

81
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:35,780
language which is now the version very

82
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,720
similar to what the modern version

83
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,639
of them which  somehow it

84
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,310
still exists and ethical initially the era of

85
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,410
insight it was the former plus now it has become

86
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,459
and ethical and that is what we say

87
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:51,230
the implementation from which it is accused

88
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,030
point and is precisely it was created by ros

89
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,669
i cali from robben people at university  of

90
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:01,400
auckland and has been developed and is

91
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,139
developed by the team takes its name from the

92
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,720
two authors and in part also from the game with the

93
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,930
name ss all these things here however

94
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,199
okay these are the amenities however

95
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,829
it was conceived in

96
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,689
1992 its initial beta knowing 95 stable

97
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:26,509
sorry released on 95 the first

98
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:29,539
stable beta in February 2004 years earlier

99
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,719
in 29 exactly four years before I

100
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,419
delivered my degree thesis for which

101
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:38,360
I did not yet exist for mere reasons

102
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,020
when I graduated in some way

103
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,400
because we did not know yet I did not know it

104
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,229
you can also mean something that was

105
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,870
very little

106
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,490
then what it was and therefore is an integrated environment

107
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,840


108
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,700
nothing programming for

109
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,010
statistical calculation and for doing graphics

110
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:03,200
and analysis i  n general data and when

111
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,570
we want to open it now I try for a moment

112
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:11,870
to show you an example let's see if r you

113
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,610
see on the screen

114
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,830
[Music]

115
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,810
we create it from here that seem I can

116
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,650
open it let's do it so excuse me it

117
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,979


118
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,580
shares a moment

119
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,659
the screen on this thing here stop

120
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,310
sharing

121
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,850
ok we could here we go to share

122
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,930
another window

123
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,979
this you also see a screenshot

124
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:46,190
on the presentation that I

125
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,080
showed you anyway this is the classic

126
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
dr aspect when it is in its

127
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,220
version more let's say ugly and a

128
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,440
little uninviting you see that with a

129
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,389
window  with a

130
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:02,509
so-called altomonte consort inside the way

131
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:04,520
in which we have to give commands to

132
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,880
ours is line up interpreter of ours

133
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,210
is the interpreter engine of the dl of the

134
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,729
language itself pd was really a

135
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:15,530
very essential thing so from

136
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,479
practically to when it was created  for

137
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,060
wine pounds there is even more essential

138
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,630
you have right in the linux shell comes

139
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,060
a command line in the wake of linux

140
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,139
here  ndi is definitely a book of an

141
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,240
instrument that does not look

142
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,770
good

143
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,030
on its own in any case precisely r if we return to

144
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,318
share our preaching

145
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:48,379
that shopping why not show it to me

146
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:55,559
that you see it the presentation no ok even

147
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,119
if here it is now we see

148
00:06:57,119 --> 00:07:03,179
ok ok perfect  so r we said

149
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:05,849
that this is what you see here at the top

150
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:07,499
right just an example of the

151
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:10,830
window dr is an open source

152
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,389
and free software

153
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,669
even if being free for this purpose there

154
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,740
are still several

155
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,009
proprietary and therefore commercial editions that

156
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,839
therefore also offer tools in

157
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,349
some  mode point of view of the

158
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:27,659
support etcetera etcetera in the present

159
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:29,580
of the

160
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,990
classic French microsoft airplus the tvr which then

161
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,629
precisely an evolution of if there is

162
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,999
a whole series of various editions there are

163
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,509
also baits with java to say

164
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:43,769
principle more things of this type

165
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:47,119
it is therefore developed in java however it

166
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:50,819
is therefore very widespread and it is also very much

167
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,409
supported by both an

168
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,539
international community that is born  then

169
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,119
substantially almost all the faculties

170
00:07:57,119 --> 00:08:00,479
of statistics in the world and then

171
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,909
by all independent developers

172
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:06,249
who add packages to us

173
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:09,289
and this is why at a statistical level the

174
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,279
foot is expected and it has grown a lot

175
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,199
because the

176
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,990
universities have made their money the year.  the

177
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,669
faculties of statistics the year made

178
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:22,490
software with which all new in the new

179
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,349
functionalities all the new ideas and new

180
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:26,119
statistical techniques that have been

181
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:28,550
conceived have been developed in fact

182
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,699
I believe 99 percent in

183
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:34,130
eras because it has now become the

184
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,589
reference tool for  all and

185
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,479
being developed black after whom

186
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,458
additional packages that

187
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,669
currently count about 15,000 only on the large

188
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,649
one which is one of the package repositories

189
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,360
all the new additional packages that

190
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,949
are created after are made

191
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:52,279
available free of charge for all was

192
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,800
and was born to perform

193
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,508
inspectors and  matrices for for

194
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,970
scalar eras for those who work with a bit of

195
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,160
mart  edì c electors but scalar is nothing more

196
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,019
than a vector of length 1 in

197
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,660
essence therefore it is not something that is

198
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,579
he was born to work with vectors

199
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:11,809
to one awake allows a

200
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:15,439
rapid development of their analytical tools and

201
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:17,299
after precisely they are distributed as a

202
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:18,910
package and are found  on the internet

203
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,230
easily indeed c to the command that

204
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,160
allows you to bring without supports many

205
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,019
types of programming from the classic non-

206
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:28,850
objects to the object in different types

207
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,929
and functional therefore it is very flexible

208
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:34,160
in mediation printing the only thing

209
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,709
is that precisely to a syntax that is not

210
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,699
always  as clear as I have well defined

211
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:42,199
how a syntax should be

212
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:46,009
languages training we said before about the

213
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:50,299
packages then there are more than 15 thousand

214
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,929
packages sukran this case is the

215
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:57,410
main repository dr basically

216
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,290
where both the sources and the

217
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,809
executables and the packages are found the dog

218
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,699
what  you see in the screenshot

219
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:08,089
above on the right that it is khan point was minus

220
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:11,389
project borges the address is ap  point

221
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:13,610
are all open source packages and

222
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,610
have been developed by university

223
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,819
to people by researchers most of the

224
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,499
time but there are also many packages

225
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:24,529
now that are

226
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,269
commercially developed

227
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:31,040
for example r studio.com which the company

228
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,169
that develops aerial studio elide

229
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:35,600
main  for that tool that

230
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,959
allows us to avoid burning for the

231
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,239
very ugly face dr but something

232
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:43,970
simpler is more comfortable the

233
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,459
developers of rd this r study

234
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:48,829
develop several very

235
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:51,049
efficient packages experience obtaining

236
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:52,790
very useful results that is

237
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,669
very useful activities for  develop

238
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:59,869
let's say many types of tackling

239
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,399
many types problems

240
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,199
data analysis graphics sharing or on the web and

241
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:10,029
things usually there are many sites that

242
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:12,319
give information

243
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:14,089
those you find below that are

244
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:15,679
those that you find below the

245
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,640
main site dr www

246
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,089
logical that if  you see above the site of the

247
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:24,040
first second level compared to what

248
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,779
we have  seen where

249
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:29,610
the executables are downloaded to the packages

250
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,110
all the other sites there is a lot

251
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,350
of information both on www.oggi.it in

252
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,000
all the other sites there is a lot

253
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,650
of information light documentation

254
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,529
all free absolutely after there

255
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:43,300
are also live for a fee but  there is a

256
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,069
lot of free material

257
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,390
but then we talked about the study area

258
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,780
what you see here on this fencing

259
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,480
is the king studio that elide main

260
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,510
after we will try to make a

261
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,180
few lines of code work elide main

262
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,980
the most used now from a universal point of

263
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,870
view  worldwide to

264
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,410
develop in there are also other other

265
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,050
packages other tools but they are not

266
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,990
so developed r studio is an idea that

267
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,180
is offered both free of charge and

268
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,740
in a paid professional form

269
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,340
both to the web interface and to the

270
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,250
interface let's say desktop  classic

271
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,440
in both sera for web and for

272
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,450
classic desktop there is a version of them

273
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,930
or for this reason it is sfj that allows them  re

274
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,900
used therefore the use in a

275
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,860
rather without any 6 no

276
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,510
puppies generally

277
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,620
ok the company that produces and studies that

278
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,300
developing on that escapes pushes a

279
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,960
lot on areas and for hobby reasons and

280
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,580
has developed many

281
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,830
advanced features that can be

282
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,200
shiny to develop applications  on the web

283
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,220
everything written in r homeland to

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,910
flexible way roxy jam makes many packages

293
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,040
because they help in

294
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,360
even a professional software development done

295
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,630
with ere

296
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:44,450
ok let's see then ok a moment r

297
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,950
let's do

298
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,440
a quick rundown of what it

299
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,060
looks like  r so we see it quickly

300
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,780
then so stop this sharing and

301
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:03,360
go to just one more critics

302
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,360
here  ndi I do not see

303
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,160
see if I can not see

304
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,860
okay let's share now

305
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,100
let's see if by chance we can

306
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,890
here is the chef share

307
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,180
ok then here he is this we said he

308
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,480
was in the studio is the one

309
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,210
I told you he could not see in great

310
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,920
record  a little bit of everything to have a

311
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:41,630
vision a little more up min

312
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,379
min

313
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:46,319
here it is then r studio

314
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,869
typically divided into four sets of cards

315
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:50,579
which are the one at the top there are

316
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,739
all the source codes here the one at the bottom

317
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:54,799
is precisely is that is, that is

318
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,029
basically the interpreter ones  of

319
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,849
the network code we have seen before only that

320
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:02,069
you take as input what we

321
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,480
have here

322
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,800
and now we have a series of

323
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,529
useful features and tools

324
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:09,779
for using r but now we do not see

325
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,990
in detail for deco we have a demo

326
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,180
code the code I built  for

327
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,160
this example these stops because gis

328
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,050
are just commands to go to

329
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,850
install that is to get

330
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,490
new packages from the internet so if I

331
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,130
have to I need d  i a package with r I

332
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,779
just do this command instal

333
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:31,139
packages name of the package after

334
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,570
independent left is an option and he

335
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,699
automatically goes pending what

336
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,380
we need we do not have to do anything

337
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,899
after that use it just say use me the

338
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,910
library for example of player that there  it is

339
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,829
written here or more panatta series of

340
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:44,550
amusing

341
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,470
in this case of selection these lines

342
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,930
of code I run these lines of

343
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,959
code go below that is they are

344
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,680
shortly sent to the deceased interpreter

345
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,560
then who follows them one at a time and

346
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,110
as he executes them  in this

347
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,050
case it loads a whole series of functions

348
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,810
the packages sorry booklets that

349
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,449
allow us to do various types of activities

350
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:10,620


351
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,290
now I hope they should have almost

352
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,420
finished

353
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,220
perfect I have put together a whole

354
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,350
series of packages of various kinds how it

355
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,230
works then it is simply when  I

356
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,480
select a line for example as in

357
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,670
this case I click on run I

358
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,590
send you see to select gaudio

359
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,620
peuterey spe  disk r2 shorter he

360
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,840
answers me you see this 1 then on the

361
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,610
side it means then it reminds me of a

362
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,010
vector of one dimension that

363
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,750
contains 5 which is the result of our

364
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,150
operation as well as this the logarithm

365
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,830
of 12

366
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,470
he returns me correctly our

367
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,860
number of the logarithm i 12  and

368
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,640
inside it for all the functions a

369
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,620
help for which that question mark in the

370
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,960
name of the command you see that is

371
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,680
sent below

372
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,140
you tell me ok then you see me appears remains

373
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,119
on the help tab demonstrates all the

374
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,579
information on the help function and the

375
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,650
various types the details  on its

376
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,869
functioning what are the parameters

377
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:14,449
that have passed there and the values that it

378
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,490
returns later to what kind of values problem

379
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,339
and the various types of functionality and

380
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,140
the important mind also

381
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,849
bibliographic references with examples as I said

382
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:29,780
before precisely r generates also works with

383
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,059
vectors in this  case i generate a

384
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:34,130
vector of values ranging from one

385
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:38,150
integer up to 10 integer 12 45 the l after

386
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,360
means a long inter value  o and after I

387
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,550
generate 10 values

388
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,139
from random distribution from Gaussian distribution

389
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,920
so you see I generated these quantities

390
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,410
here if I want to see this as boss and

391
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,050
prevented that they are two objects that

392
00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:00,559
contain 6 kg partners and then

393
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,899
select the row clicked on run

394
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:04,730
below demonstrates just the  content of

395
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,840
this which are its own the

396
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,840
contained values and gers is the same thing for

397
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,230
dar es

398
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,110
see here it is air studios this

399
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,210
case r studio there is also completely

400
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,490
automatic those things there this dabo 6

401
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,760
presented of this operation is as

402
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,310
you see has as a symbol of

403
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,320
equal assignment or the arrow for him is the

404
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,630
same thing are assignment symbols

405
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,680
and therefore this bubbles is a vector of

406
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,380
10 elements generated at random from a

407
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,290
random distribution

408
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,360
the mean 0 standard deviation 1 in

409
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,299
this case it is okay however

410
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:48,310
we can also generate matrices

411
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,890
and dimensions  dumb and

412
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,290
multinational matrices that is

413
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,240
re we can do all the calculations the

414
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,150
calculations come precisely because it was born for

415
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,820
the  calculation as of tones the calculations

416
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,860
are developed just if I make

417
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,600
three signs sv multiplies by is

418
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,390
then my integer vector as well as sine

419
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,330
of doubles makes me it calculates the sine of

420
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,430
all ten values that are contained

421
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,220
in my vector taurus

422
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,860
if I have to do  multiplication between vectors

423
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,500
even here multiplies each element of

424
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,530
gas by the corresponding element of

425
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,330
doubles then the first with the first

426
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,850
second by second and forward so

427
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,750
squared

428
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,230
me the square of this art object

429
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,630
and we first created that it is a multi-

430
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,230
dimensional 2342 pepper quattro

431
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,750
dimensions even here the

432
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,640
material calculation is very simple this is

433
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,289
a material operation in which I

434
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:51,370
calculate mi6 a matrix this is

435
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,930
made up of

436
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,640
rows and five columns

437
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,900
I what I do hicks transposed hicks for extra

438
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,090
cost more generally to point a

439
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,700
4x4 matrix is just  this operator

440
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,250
would do the calculation of the matrix product

441
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,700


442
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,130
another characteristic thing dr are the

443
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,980
cold data which are the  base

444
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:21,240
sorry I am the basis of the magis of the data

445
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,550
with and drawn up frames are substantially

446
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,659
because it does not make me

447
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:33,110
successful and of the mold we try

448
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,000
this is right because there are not

449
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,179
there is this and there is not this even

450
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:42,150
ok frame are basically  dell

451
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,060
as of the database tables of which

452
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,790
we have that the columns are rows

453
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,740
by columns to each column its

454
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,900
data type each row represents a

455
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,410
measured object and therefore we have

456
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,630
for the data so that they are a basic tool

457
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,270
for after doing the statistical elaborations

458
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,270


459
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,910
excuse me they are  a second no

460
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,250
agreement that we see how long but

461
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,670
maybe we can do it then to give an

462
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,740
example on how to do for example a

463
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,160
model with r we see part I try to

464
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,230
use the data that you feel the data

465
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,909
the italtennis for the titanic

466
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:22,980
and padova

467
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,140
vico  use me data to the titans that generate

468
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,630
a model in which I go to predict the

469
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,320
status that is survivor no of my

470
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,640
passenger according to the

471
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,660
travel class of the sex of the age

472
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,860
of the possible interaction by

473
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,299
age class age and sex and travel class

474
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,280
age etcetera etcetera

475
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,990
you see that this is just I build

476
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,940
a model and establish it I build

477
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,220
it by putting together a formula that

478
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,450
defines me as

479
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,950
now if we want to go and see what

480
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,960
are the characteristics  you see the data

481
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,440
we have are the class

482
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,019
the journey the sex of the passenger the age

483
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,929
and the status doing an operation of

484
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:06,600
this type I say it gender in the model

485
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,379
that I go to predict which class the

486
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:12,299
status that is if the person

487
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,639
survived or not  depending on

488
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:16,500
what are all the variables that

489
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,429
we have inside it

490
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:20,769
is very essential to see very very

491
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:23,110
direct generate which we have all the

492
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,090
estimates of the parameters that make us

493
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,980
generate that model that is this

494
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,529
would be the value that intercepts

495
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:30,970
this value that goes to us  to impact

496
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,639
on the class etcetera etcetera very

497
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:35,049
last thing I know that I am

498
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:36,940
practically at the end I am already

499
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,419
late

500
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:40,779
if we want to obtain  a forecast

501
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:44,570
project mode is the model generated by

502
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,830
our father henry predict on new data

503
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,769
this how it could go for us

504
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,840
new people with characteristics

505
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,090
each and them using the model we

506
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,950
have estimated just now predict

507
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,039
what the answer is then

508
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,779
any of the single people was opened

509
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:04,549
I predict the probability that this will

510
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,889
survive or not and these you see

511
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:08,090
below are precisely these

512
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,129
probabilities that for some may

513
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:12,139
be high for others are rather

514
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:14,239
low depending on

515
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:16,480
their characteristics

516
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:20,330
the very last thing just to see we

517
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,480
have not seen a desire  show you

518
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,009
this is the graphic representations

519
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:27,789
with

520
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,180
europe

521
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,380
we see san siro fa

522
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:38,440
more sincere truth they were let's see

523
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,340
why if he does

524
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,190
it I don't know why he doesn't give me the graphics in

525
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:52,480
this case very well okay I wanted to

526
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,520
show you an example of graphics we can

527
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,170
do it with this which is a graphic  that

528
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,990
at least resize let's see if

529
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,710
this function

530
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,160
ok here it is

531
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,110
it was in fact supports both two-dimensional graphics and

532
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,030
you are dimensional in

533
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,890
this case it is a representation that does not

534
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,870
discard flop you think it allows us to

535
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,470
interact precisely with the points go and

536
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,640
immerse ourselves in the points because it is not

537
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,440
a vector structure so go and

538
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,720
see what are the characteristics I

539
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,190
do not know some graph from before  it did not

540
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,880
work

541
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,680
obviously they are looking for here it does it there was

542
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,390
here it is part result of the first

543
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,700
previous graph

544
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,500
you see that with a few lines of code you

545
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,000
can make graphs that are also

546
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,070
aesthetically very nice this is one

547
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,590
of the gigi flop libraries because I said

548
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,600
first developed r studio that  it is very

549
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,550
powerful because it allows you to make

550
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,970
very nice graphics with a syntax is

551
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,210
quite simple just say let's see if

552
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,770
something much to say about the

553
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,460
presentation

554
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,690
I would say no apart from here if you want to have

555
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,030
more information on this write the

556
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,980
keys I would say that it can be enough I think I

557
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,640
am  managed to stay within the times

558
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,410
we have exceeded states i  Internal, however,

559
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,240
if inside the tesla of the slot

560
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,840
for which thank you so much then I wanted to ask

561
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,720
if anyone has any questions as

562
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,910
usual I have to do then leave internal

563
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,280
or our tehreek group not the one

564
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,110
in two minutes by intervening directly

565
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,580
in the conference

566
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,530
otherwise a question I have respected

567
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,610
British  loviso also on other

568
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,670
occasions of values and expectations for

569
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:51,140
rollata causes if you speak and used a

570
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,130
little reference you can find them

571
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,330
very often everywhere we say that it is one of

572
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,880
those very used the one more than

573
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,760
yesterday if I don't know if you heard about

574
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,130
the first example anyway  of

575
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,450
discriminant analysis that is and is

576
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,370
basically a forecast for qualitative

577
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,050
data on fisher date 7 and are the two big ones

578
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,390
perhaps best known date 7 that are used

579
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,400
that age the technicians are found in different

580
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,680
versions around in r included right

581
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,620
within  r between the example data and

582
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,840
also those of the iris which are precisely

583
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,000
data on length, width of petals,

584
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,480
centuries, kind of rewriting  if they are

585
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,040
probed standard that can be found

586
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,200
quite easily

587
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,610
none however rati truth is that

588
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,670
of the three volatile technicians

589
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:45,290
well then what i see came a

590
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,210
question from max that spoils what is the

591
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,610
difference between r python libraries

592
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:53,300
like shine shake it for

593
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,310
shakey byrne and if  then

594
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:02,570
let's say that there is this diatribe

595
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,330
between ponists arrests

596
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,850
then I am a neutral let's say I

597
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,830
like it r because I have been working on it for a long

598
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,980
time and I have learned to use it for

599
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,340
development, for example with the code by

600
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,690
developing in functional mode you

601
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:20,060
can keep  of the very compact code

602
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,730
also quite fast and very robust and

603
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,010
that does many things so I like it

604
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,420
but there is none in my opinion no

605
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,340
need to become

606
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,040
fans of technique

607
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,520
with respect to the air and for example

608
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,630
developed their own study duty to a

609
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,460
package called networks closes it

610
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,430
which allows

611
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,530
r to interact transparently with python that is

612
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,690
we can run cod  ice repel

613
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,700
the data of our aerial code make it

614
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,800
run in a next line written in

615
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,260
python and then take the result

616
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,880
of this line written in python what to

617
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,530
do and use it on again forward with a

618
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,880
whole very strong interoperability

619
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,900
said this

620
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,460
scekic lerda is basically the

621
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,370
package  for python machine learning

622
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,630


623
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,670
r does not have a package for machine

624
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,710
learning because it was created to do

625
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,990
statistics and within this there is

626
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,940
also machine learning so there will be

627
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,910
many features in r that will be

628
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,280
that will develop glues that are similar

629
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,770
or equal to  those of pichler skis so

630
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,990
the distrustful difference is a little how they

631
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:42,490
were developed and how maybe in

632
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,590
some cases one will be a little faster

633
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,600
another 1 will be a little less fast but

634
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,910
in my opinion lady did almost

635
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,440
everything she found a part

636
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,140
on the other hand we can say that for more

637
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,960
strictly machine learning activities I believe

638
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,140
that python is a little more developed

639
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,110
I think if you want to  throw them a little more

640
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,240
on the statistics then typically on

641
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,480
a little less data but if you want to

642
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,310
get results or there are

643
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,330
more advanced Bayesian complex techniques,

644
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,500
i.e. for etcetera then

645
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,310
in my opinion better so they are let's say

646
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,590
I would put it in this in these

647
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,650
terms the  difference

648
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,980
let's say that I see it this way because

649
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,920
then both are now becoming

650
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,310
in standard use a bit of python proud

651
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,110
of scripting languages that

652
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,850
interface with much more

653
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,710
sophisticated tools more often than not for example

654
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,100
al bis parker talks about h2o

655
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:48,620
I talk about who he is  another of the tools

656
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,559
for all the free

657
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,450
ones that are made that work on big

658
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,179
systems where we use r simply

659
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:59,270
to give or phyton to give the command is fine,

660
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,950
for example also that it was therefore to

661
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,260
have more than one lysis and to give a

662
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,030
command which then followed by

663
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,100
another for another engine which then

664
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,900
returns exempt plane to python pd

665
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,510
in my opinion they are almost interchangeable

666
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,850


667
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:21,280
ddr and python are two different working philosophies in some way, but

668
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,049
also in the r environment there is a lot of

669
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:25,929
effort to have a strong

670
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:30,500
