1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
then this is a contained version

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,000
of the presentation that I

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,550
normally do that a little longer I

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,070
can speak 8 hours of df then

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,830
21 minutes as you understand the minimum

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,560
minimum minimum then in the field of

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,960
standards the appearance can deceive

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,600
this almost always happens in the field

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,060
of  software standards in the field of

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,420
hardware standards we are often forced by

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,179
hardware to respect the standard and

12
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,680
therefore not in fact we do not choose

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,899
the chef someone else for us in the field

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,100
of software

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,079
user intervention is essential

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,430
so a big mess happens

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,739
when  it was realized that

18
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,690
there could be standard format booths

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,730
in the software realized when

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,390
tim berners lee

21
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,219
fortunately dogged the fact that html had to

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,899
be a standalone format for

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,170
royalty free etc etc and

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,890
so he went out of his way because  the

25
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,700
control of the html was entrusted to

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,869
a third party

27
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,630
before it was the cern which is not so much

28
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,990
ter  However, as long as there was tim

29
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,890
it was and then it became the world wide

30
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,420
web consortium we realized that a

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,380
truly standard format allowed

32
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,759
everyone to view the contents

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,670
regardless of the tool they

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,299
used therefore computer tablet

35
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,630
smartphone software of each  type because it

36
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,100
is precisely the format was print and therefore

37
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,729
in 2006 in 2000 to 2000 let's say when

38
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:56,410
openoffice was born from da star office it was

39
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,680
decided to give it a standard format and

40
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,790
the standard format was born in fact it is a

41
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,700
document is a description based on the

42
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,179
consent  standards are based on

43
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:12,190
consolidated elements so the standards

44
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,580
normally adopt other standards

45
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,040
this in the case of edf for example we

46
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,330
start from the dublin core

47
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:25,480
then there is hicks forms there is t mar

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,030
the mathematical annotation there are

49
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,020
a whole series of t formats the most trivial one

50
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,420
if you want it to be respected by them

51
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,000
by udf and not respected by the form

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,700
of microsoft and the gregorian calendar

53
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,290
which also respect the ci  nesi and

54
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,840
Arabs of religion different calendar but

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,910
not compared to microsoft so we

56
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,890
arrived at the definition this is a

57
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,630
shared definition of

58
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,480
standard and open format and independent of a

59
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,940
single product and supplier is

60
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,970
interoperable because it allows the

61
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,620
sharing of data between

62
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,350
heterogeneous systems neutral because  clearly it

63
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,480
does not force the user to use a single

64
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,920
product and is perennial because it is not

65
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,860
based then it is practically

66
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,709
completely separate from the concept

67
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,450
introduced by microsoft of beck ward

68
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,340
compatibility in fact when

69
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,410
the line asks me it do not think about

70
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,360
backwards compatibility think that

71
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,840
this is a formula  compatibility

72
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,959
means that those who thought it

73
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,150
at the beginning thought that it could be

74
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,780
extended with other information but that the

75
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,350


76
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,930
basic format therefore the version zero if

77
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,810
we want to call it that was always

78
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,660
readable even by those who could not

79
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,670
stand it anymore simply because it is

80
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,520
also a subset  the microscopic of

81
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,020
that  which is the standard is wanted today

82
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,450
we are df 1.3 not yet standardized

83
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,770
by iso but standardized by oasiss which

84
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,810
obviously has more function than

85
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,820
udf 1.0

86
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,000
but if you open 1df 1.0 you do not even notice it

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,100
simply because

88
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,000
the software has more features

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,010
than those  that there are in the format

90
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,240
so it is different from becquer

91
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,810
compatibility who is one who is an

92
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,660
artifice created by

93
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,170
proprietary software to say we continue to be

94
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,510
compatible yes because we continue to

95
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:46,630
keep our login tools

96
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,760
in a perpetual way

97
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,450
then or df from office open xml  are

98
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,010
completely

99
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,980
different from this point of view we talk about interoperability

100
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,140
there is a European definition of

101
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,120
interoperability it seems easy but

102
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,220
when you talk to those of the

103
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,560
proprietary software fans all those who

104
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,940
do not seem to understand the concept of

105
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,610
interoperability so you always have to

106
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,710
bring them something the clearly

107
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,540
proprietary lego but a concept  of

108
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,880
open interoperability the bricks  that

109
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,870
I used when I was 6 years old and therefore

110
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,330
exactly 60 years ago my nephew uses them today

111
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,290
who is more or less the same

112
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,880
age and because because they have not changed they

113
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,700
have changed colors probably has

114
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,940
also the materials but the basic principle has not changed

115
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,100
so  now it's like

116
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,190
saying we have an extended standard of

117
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,680
lego bricks because the

118
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,760
colors and shapes have changed but the way

119
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,620
of joining has remained the same which was

120
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,670
what guarantees interoperability

121
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:00,060
where we are compared to the standards

122
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,890
we have everything you need

123
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,350
from a technical point of view  which are the

124
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,990
communication protocols because obviously if

125
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,730
we want to interoperate we have to

126
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,540
exchange the data and the contents

127
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,040
then the standard communication protocols

128
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,280
there are the standard formats of

129
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,220
documents and files there are CEOs and

130
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,410
there are others if we want to get out of

131
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,670
the formats for  productivity

132
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,260
when you get to myself at the

133
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,720
semantic level we have the crafty of

134
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,000
technology and here then you will understand it meg  lio

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,190
when I will do some examples concerning

136
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,430
fixed for xml when instead we go up to

137
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,840
the organizational level we have the

138
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,490
resistance to change that is

139
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,260
people tell you and I cannot

140
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,470
work because this is different from

141
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,780
what I did up to now and also

142
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,750
explaining to him that the different means

143
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,330
an evolution an improvement in many

144
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,970
cases they have a natural resistance

145
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,770
which is then explained by the psychologists

146
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,920
but which from a technical point of view is

147
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,300
completely unnatural which however is

148
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,280
the biggest obstacle

149
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,290
when entering large organizations

150
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,730


151
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,140
seems to be the  migration is not

152
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,670
a problem the format of the documents becomes a problem

153
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,430
because it seems that people

154
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,370
have the informal formal of documents

155
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,650
a like the linus blanket for

156
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,380
small children the transitional object if I

157
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,300
take it off I lose all my certainties two

158
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,350
standards

159
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,960
the first  df a beautiful dove

160
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,560
etc. the second is clearly not

161
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,680
having a logo there was a greek who

162
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,620
is  enjoyed making a logo with bananas

163
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,950
also because he knows very well that I

164
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,730
am a promoter how to say very active

165
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,490
god df the only thing I don't eat on

166
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,960
earth are bananas

167
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,410
so this office open xml logo made

168
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,570
with bananas disgusts me not  only for

169
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,760
the contents of the format but also because it

170
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,160
is made with bananas keep in mind

171
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,410
that if I see a person eating

172
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,570
a banana I feel pity for that

173
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,390
person because I know he is doing

174
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,060
something absolutely terrifying at least

175
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,370
for myself

176
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,100
I hope not for him as it comes  managed by end

177
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,530
asis there is a technical committee

178
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,280
which is that of the developers, that is the

179
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,260
one that works on the growth of the

180
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,760
evolution of the standard is

181
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,700
focused on the specifications it is an

182
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,390
eminently technical committee we do not

183
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:53,180
talk about adoption problems we talk

184
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,910
about management problems  standard

185
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,570
by software then

186
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,630
rationalization of descriptions

187
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,610
simplification solutions of bugs

188
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,680
applied to the standard and so on

189
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,620
e  then there is 1df lawyers or by project I

190
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,640
am one of the two chairs of this one of

191
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,400
this open project the other and marina

192
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,960
latini who is also part of the top

193
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,360
foundation has just been relaunched

194
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,240
because this announcement on Wednesday 8

195
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,280
May was actually  wednesday 8 may

196
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,040
last year sorry for the lack

197
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,870
of the year there was a 1 df adoption

198
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,390
which however was closed in 2011 because

199
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,850
because those ibm funny guys who

200
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,279
had promoted it and created it did not

201
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,950
want to sit at the same table

202
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,170
where the representatives sat  of

203
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,940
libreoffice on the other hand ibm created

204
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,800
open office pace to kill

205
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,960
libreoffice is therefore in a completely

206
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,170
coherent way they did not want to sit around the

207
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,400
table with the people who would have

208
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,130
gladly killed this I also find it

209
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,950
ethical from their point of view which is

210
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,279
oriented and the  marketing education a

211
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,700
bit tiring because clearly we

212
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,880
have just completed the phase of

213
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,529
aggregation of people

214
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:24,529
within this committee

215
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,690
there will be a lot  to more activities and by

216
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,600
the summer we will hopefully come up with

217
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,510
a site where there will be many materials

218
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,010
that will allow us to better understand

219
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,529
the key characteristics of udf I have

220
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:42,260
already said so I repeat only a

221
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,170
fundamental concept while the

222
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,630
proprietary formats directly associate the

223
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,150
content to software the

224
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,540
standard format of f dissociates the content from the

225
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,140
software

226
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,620
this means that any software

227
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,620
well built around the df format is

228
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,410
able to read and write the format

229
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,209
in an absolutely neutral way and with

230
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,100
absolutely neutral means that the

231
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,110
files o of f si  they are a bit similar to all

232
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,770
those in the software

233
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,660
someone told me that they are a bit

234
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,610
monotonous I said well in the case of the

235
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,610
standards monotony is an advantage

236
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,400
imagine if your 220 socket was at

237
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,790
220 one day the next day at 260 and it

238
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,339
burns you all  home I say in this case

239
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:34,459
the monotony of 220 which always 220

240
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:36,529
is actually an advantage the same and in the

241
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,339
case of document formats  e

242
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:42,620
standard in france holland portugal

243
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,180
united kingdom and taiwan

244
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,830
the most advanced country ever and taiwan

245
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,140
because the government is absolutely

246
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,890
aligned in favor of edf just to

247
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,440
give you an idea at the last conference

248
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,840
on it taiwan attended by the

249
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,690
president of the republic in italy

250
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,900
imagine if which in their case is

251
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,810
like the prime minister here

252
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,650
imagine if the prime minister

253
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,620
participated could ever think of

254
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,470
attending an event on a

255
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,200
standard format in theory it would be

256
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,270
standard also in Italy I did not put it

257
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,630
because to avoid getting caught  for the

258
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,880
bottoms because it is a standard but no one

259
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,330
respects it and therefore it is as if the standard

260
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,460
did not exist

261
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,280
therefore formats have 211 and standard

262
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,960
the other was a pseudo standard because

263
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,690
because iso made a fool of

264
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,080
approving it as a standard by trusting

265
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,480
microsoft who has it  combined of cooked

266
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,960
and raw also of other on the format

267
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,810
itself let's see a bit of synthesis on

268
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,880
these things

269
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,860
then as libreoff writes  ice let

270
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,810
's take the famous to be or not to be this is

271
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,030
the ableton problem libreoffice

272
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,240
writes it with this is the

273
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,790
libreoffice string clearly the p1 for those

274
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,780
unfamiliar with the format of f is

275
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,490
the format of the paragraph clearly

276
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,580
compares therefore paragraph and n being so

277
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,460
short the  the document because it was only

278
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,000
this line obviously there is only one

279
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,160
one format style for that paragraph

280
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,760
and therefore it is p1 if there were more styles there

281
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,640
would be a p1 p2 a p 3 at the beginning of

282
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,130
each paragraph not of each word

283
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,650
and this is an if  for those who know the ps

284
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,640
ml it is all very standard xml

285
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,910
let's see how microsoft office writes it

286
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,420
then in the meantime the w obviously stands for

287
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,020
world but it is not in it is not part

288
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,990
of the

289
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,250
xml standard so microsoft reinvents the

290
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,980
xml standard puts the comma on a

291
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,740
line  separated, however, he gives it a command

292
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,050
for the servers that does not exist in the

293
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,450
normal xml, telling him tiella together because

294
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,850
in reality the comma is part of all

295
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,130
this and writes to be o  not to be

296
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,600
this is the problem on four lines

297
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,540
clearly this has nothing to

298
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,760
do with xml from the syntactic point of view

299
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,220
and that is why I said

300
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,040
before the crafty of the neighborhood because

301
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,730
because those who know how to read an xml

302
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,760
from the point of view of the standard

303
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,690
dublin core are actually few and

304
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,149
therefore people when they see even if

305
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:47,260
the microsoft office files explode they do not

306
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,800
understand that it is not absolutely

307
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,110
standard but we look at the repercussions

308
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,940
on other things the brain and computer

309
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,250
for the brain these red for the

310
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,510
computer ff0000 then  libreoffice

311
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,790
writes it with color format also this

312
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:09,430
xml standard and then it is obviously the

313
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,390
number of the color or it

314
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,130
even fixes ski it writes it in three

315
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,200
different ways depending on the three software by

316
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,670
putting in it some tags that

317
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,160
are completely imaginative even

318
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,810
an RGB is invented when  we know

319
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:30,339
very well that that is not a rgb

320
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:35,620
leaves us to who is the power point which is the

321
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,740
name of powerpoint here  ndo was

322
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,110
acquired by the Texan company that

323
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,420
originally developed it fear then it

324
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,680
is not a microsoft product and so on

325
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,149
so this to give you an idea of

326
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:55,120
how xml was tortured by microsoft

327
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,250
office obviously with all the

328
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,260
interoperability problems that derive from it

329
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,529
because why  an engine that has been

330
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,140
educated like that of libreoffice to

331
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,769
read and write an xml done well

332
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,559
obviously is in a bad way when it

333
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,869
has to read it writes xml names which is

334
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:16,589
extremely creative also because xml

335
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:19,410
changes then in the meantime before I was talking about the

336
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,709
car of the Gregorian calendar calc the

337
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:26,249
dates  he writes them as a normal human being

338
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:31,860
excel writes them with a

339
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,639
progressive number from 1st January 1900 to

340
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,799
today however he adds to this

341
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,040
progressive number a 29th February 1900 which

342
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,759
never existed but which has been kept

343
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,970
for backward compatibility with lotus u23

344
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,970
therefore not even one  becquer compatibility

345
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,179
with excel but with another product in

346
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,779
this way so in theory I

347
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:03,569
will not be  he was born on 19 1948 but on 19947 the day

348
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:08,849
after 1st January 1900 but the

349
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:11,549
nicest thing and when I make

350
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:13,409
presentations at which they are present so

351
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:15,000
I always ask them about their

352
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,159
date of birth they obviously

353
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:19,319
answer me as if I answered 12

354
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,529
August  54 say calm down a moment if you

355
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:24,510
are the sel you have to tell me the excel number

356
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,789
of the date of birth because otherwise

357
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:28,649
you would use another software you would

358
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:31,559
simply shiver from the use

359
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,450
of a software that tells you that you

360
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,289
were born as I was born in 19 1948 well  none

361
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,630
of those from maio sotto obviously knows

362
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,539
his date of birth in excel format

363
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,250
maybe he knows it for those who in some case apple

364
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,440
study I tell him during the

365
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,450
presentation

366
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,010
anyway this is one of the examples

367
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,710
so it totally lacks compatibility

368
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,320
the worst thing that libreoffice to

369
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,690
be  compatible with excel introduces

370
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,289
an error in all in all the dates that it

371
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,929
saves in the office formats and this

372
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,730
does not only do libre office but all

373
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,980
softw  are that they save in the

374
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,250
microsoft office format

375
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,940
as I said before there is this problem of

376
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,440
mo of tip and maximum simplicity

377
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,820
the office should be ml maximum complexity

378
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,590
we make a comparison of this file

379
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:28,200
are 22 pages at a lorem ipsum or f

380
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,960
222 lines all  versions once

381
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,899
came out in 223

382
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:38,169
as you can see office goes from 1040 in

383
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:43,809
office 2010 to 11 thousand 6 cells 12.800

384
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:48,549
54 in office for macintosh 2011

385
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:50,370
but the cutest thing is that clearly

386
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,620
mylos users do not

387
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,450
want to miss anything so

388
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,279
they have collections  summer winter

389
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,429
autumn and spring formats as

390
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:03,129
you see one the same version of the

391
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:06,190
software if looking at the 2016 saves in

392
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,740
four different ways depending on the

393
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,659
season however it is fair I mean

394
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:13,480
why its leave the

395
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,149
summer autumn winter and spring collections only

396
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:19,059
to cucci and others  we also have it

397
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:22,899
with microsoft office users

398
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,279
naive reductions and all libreoffice developers

399
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:26,200
are brilliant all

400
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,179
developers  microsoft office are

401
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:29,799
pricks sorry plus incapable guests

402
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,889
because clearly projecting it is a

403
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:35,110
little different however the concept but the

404
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,539
reality is that all this is done

405
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:40,120
to defend a market that is still

406
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,639
worth over 25 billion dollars today

407
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:47,080
so office documents are made

408
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,970
to deceive  users and yet there is

409
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,710
a byproduct to this which is

410
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,240
security

411
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,509
the german government this is a slide of

412
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:00,850
a presentation made by six mantechs

413
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,830
commissioned by the german government in

414
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,700
2011 it noted that microsoft formats

415
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,629
were the most used in

416
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:13,600
attacks by

417
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,789
cybercriminals.

418
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:17,620
the situation has even worsened

419
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,750
because at the end of 2018

420
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,570
this is kaspersky sorry missing

421
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,789
the attribution never kaspersky lab itself

422
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:29,600
in the fourth quarter of 2018

423
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,059
even 70 percent of all

424
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:35,019
cyber attacks are done

425
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:39,019
through the microsoft office files and

426
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:40,669
on the other hand  you expect from

427
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:43,909
a company that publishes is available

428
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,729
on his site still today if you want it

429
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:50,769
but I have the original pdf a

430
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:53,409
manual on outlook in your client

431
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:56,299
practically how to handcuff your

432
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:58,729
customers and it is not a company that makes

433
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:00,950
support tools for law enforcement

434
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,869


435
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:07,580
therefore non-standard 2000 BC

436
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,710
no type of interoperability pseudo

437
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,220
standard 2000 after christ false

438
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,029
interoperability true standard or of f

439
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:18,769
always 2000 after christ true

440
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:24,320
interoperability i finished and i think i hope

441
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,950
to be true but you stayed in

442
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,799
twenty one minutes and ten believe 15 seconds

443
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,649
so very well i went that

444
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:35,809
i hope that  everything is clear I

445
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:38,599
am obviously available for questions

446
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:42,889
if there are any lives in the meantime we

447
00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:45,200
thank you very much also for having held

448
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,690
this project a little baptismal having

449
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,519
given a little further as the first ever

450
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,869
obviously there is still space for

451
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:56,509
questions and answers so who  he wants can

452
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:58,940
turn on video turn on microphone

453
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,190
or send questions in the

454
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,109
internal chat here or in the register of roms you are looking for

455
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:08,450
horde that of the east so maybe

456
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:14,049
you are already registered almost all and therefore

457
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,609
we do not already have the first question that

458
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:18,950
says we can have links document the

459
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:25,629
slides then then the slides sails I send

460
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,280
I have several versions this

461
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,110
I send it to you if you want I will also send you the

462
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,140
longer version  long that which is what

463
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,300
I normally do in Italian there is a

464
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,490
few more linking slides or

465
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,760
even now I would not share the

466
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,560
document much longer because it

467
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,260
needs a bit of background so there

468
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,180
are some passages that are perhaps a little

469
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,120
more difficult a  a little more technical then however

470
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,920
these slides no problem

471
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,990
I will share them and then you put them

472
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,040
where you want ok we will put them on the

473
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,950
project site which is temporarily all

474
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,960
of the east but if you go to the eastern range

475
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,690
and you will also find the history

476
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,870
of the  evenings the slides are connected

477
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,810
and as we are doing well

478
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,700
just to record if we can

479
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,670
record between the mechanics and the

480
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,150
video links to the videos that will be published

481
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,870
on the esc channel then there is

482
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,940
another question from max who says that you

483
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,590
think there only office then only

484
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,490
office is a horrid clon of microsoft

485
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,480
office is totally reverse

486
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,550
engineering as they are based in russia and

487
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,900
therefore do not respond to  to all the

488
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,000
limitations of reverse engineering that

489
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,070
there are outside of russia they have

490
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:02,400
created their own internal format on

491
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,960
microsoft office and practically clone

492
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,040
the drivers

493
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,310
for which the management of the formats in

494
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,230
some cases is better than that of

495
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,600
libreoffice but the problem is that they

496
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,080
help  microsoft to perpetuate the login

497
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,330
that is the big problem that is people

498
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,550
say I am more compatible

499
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,350
the problem is that we go out in this way

500
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,880
we go into a discussion field that

501
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,940
the wrong one that is I am compatible

502
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,040
with a non-interoperable format the

503
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,280
speech should be yes but you are not

504
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,410
interoperable i.e. you are compatible

505
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:49,000
with office formats but it's like today

506
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,049
using a diesel

507
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:59,710
euro 0 the car goes but produces an anger

508
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,330
of god of carbon dioxide if we do not

509
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,460
look to the future that machine

510
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,200
could go on for 20 years

511
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,989
the concept is exactly the same that is

512
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:13,539
office or microsoft formats are

513
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:17,759
polluting formats pollute

514
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,850
the ecosystem of users if users

515
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,489
were educated to use

516
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,450
standard formats  their attitude

517
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,009
would change completely they would understand the

518
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:32,499
advantage of standard formats of course

519
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:35,200
between going from a proprietary format

520
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,059
you have been used to for twenty years has a

521
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:39,210
standard format you are not used to

522
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,739
requires a bit of effort but

523
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:44,379
that's the point  we continue otherwise

524
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:48,639
use diesel euro 0 then we will die like

525
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:51,730
grasshoppers here we will not die but

526
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,820
clearly the costs of non-

527
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,850
interoperability are costs that go

528
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,519
are borne by everyone they are not borne

529
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:04,350
only by the undersigned of the single user

530
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,980
when the document is not visible

531
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,779
explodes it is not recoverable  so on

532
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:13,960
are costs for companies

533
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,869
unfortunately there is little documentation on

534
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,940
this  but here too there are some

535
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,950
quite interesting documents that

536
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,559
show how in a single sector in the

537
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:26,259
United States about 500 million dollars are thrown each year

538
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:29,980
on a single

539
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,759
product sector

540
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:36,970
then we have one last question

541
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,879
and then for the other thoughts that will

542
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:41,769
also be available via  email or in any case

543
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:47,609
it is certainly the question to give you how much

544
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:48,850
xml

545
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:55,180
xml of adobe Indesign then I do not know

546
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,020
the xml of Adobe Indesign but the

547
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,440
concept is that adobe Indesign does not create

548
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,730
standard formats so in theory it can

549
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:12,550
put xml that you want cml was born as a

550
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:18,790
standard to guarantee there for  being part

551
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,920
of a process towards

552
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,060
software interoperability however it

553
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,340
is not like all things it is not that it locks

554
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,610
the user then the problem of or of the

555
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,610
formal office and that are standardized

556
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,270
by iso the formats of Indesign not being

557
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,540
standardized by  none

558
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,370
i mean they can use in theory they

559
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,520
can do what they want

560
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,340
surely i suspect seeing that

561
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,590
those of and robbie have done i  The

562
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,870
sub number on the pdf which was a

563
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:56,160
great number i.e. the pdf up to version

564
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,140
1.7 which is the original pdf is much more

565
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,220
standard pdf 2.0 although they

566
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,820
tell us that it is more standard 2.0 because

567
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,130
they have eliminated the proprietary parts

568
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,720
the problem is that they have eliminated

569
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,450
proprietary parts that were documented

570
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,160
and introduced

571
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,220
undocumented proprietary extensions so

572
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,310
now you have a pdf 2.0 that knows it

573
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,040
is only opened by acrobat reader

574
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,070
and a theoretically non-standard pdf 1.7 that

575
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:36,490
is opened by the world and as long as iso as to

576
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,610
say it opens the cornucopia and  if he has it

577
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,920
filled in because here we are definitely talking

578
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,330
about money and we are in the hands of

579
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,130
scoundrels from the point of view of

580
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,550
standards clearly those who go to

581
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,630
lobby have seen what

582
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,540
microsoft did he said we do it too it

583
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,750
seems clear to me they did it when

584
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,080
john warnock who was the inventor of the

585
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,080
pdf has retired i have been

586
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,970
lucky in my life to work with

587
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:12,590
john war  nock in fact when he is

588
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,340
questioned he says I have nothing to do with the current pdf

589
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,960


590
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,500
I wanted something else but these are

591
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,010
the things that are not difficult to know if

592
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,160
you are not part or if you have not had the

593
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,850
good fortune to meet him during the  course

594
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:36,730
of your life is complicated
