1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,840
I was born as a technician but having

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,250
a certainty I got a bit bored the

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,440
technology is too complex and the

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,240
kitchen is usually found in people

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,030
happier than technology

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,889
so I will show you something that

7
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:17,990
comes from my Apulian destination because

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,409
precisely by staying in pavia it is  a trio 3 place

9
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:23,599
in the province of Milan even if

10
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:26,419
they don't know it from Prato where they only know how to make

11
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:28,189
clear soup that this group is

12
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:31,999
credible and the heavenly cake that is

13
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:34,940
heavenly by little so from my

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,550
Apulian side comes with the

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,760
sugary mangone that is this  what you

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,660
need here a pot pan better if made

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,620
of aluminum because you need to be

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,179
quick to heat up and cool down

19
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:56,030
this is what I use I put it

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,839
over spam

21
00:00:56,839 --> 00:01:00,350
the diameter will be 25 or 28 cm with

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,449
these it can do up to half a kilo

23
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:04,700
normally when  I was a little less

24
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,460
experienced there is a maximum of 100 grams

25
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,390
at a time

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,570
ingredients almonds these are three

27
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,710
ounces dry two duets of almonds and one

28
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,450
ounce of sugar in this  ta photo with

29
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,210
sugar there is no sugar you can see it

30
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,350
here behind a spoon so they are about

31
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,540
25 grams budget I don't like the

32
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,760
complication simple business I like

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,660
the twine so these are three

34
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,470
ounces of dried fruit and sugar priests

35
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,450
with a drop  of water as you can see

36
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,890
the water is low

37
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,600
when it seems to me too little in the

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,870
most methods and bonivento reminds me a little of

39
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,270
my Mantuan meta how I make the

40
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,530
sauce I boil the grapes for about 10 20

41
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,230
minutes but some say put half the grapes  and

42
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,660
half water and boil for four hours

43
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,000
the only gun if you add the water has to

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,280
wait for it to dry and it doesn't make much

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,900
sense

46
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,630
so in this case we have 2 teas of

47
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,720
almonds and a pound of beach the show is

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,060
even if it is not with  cher because if you

49
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,280
speak an Apulian of fireflies

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,680
everyone looks badly it seems to me that a

51
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,350
percentage is the right one so with

52
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,890
this situation we find ourselves

53
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,080
lighting a fire and this thing boils well it

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,569
makes a kind of infernal marble be

55
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,700
careful that the temperat  ura of this

56
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,030
object is well above the temperature

57
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,150
of the stadium.I use in fact with the pan

58
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,250
and a little oil or if you want to open the

59
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,110
sugar you can detach all the

60
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,720
components from the marley plates in one

61
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,830


62
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,450
go.The problem is that you have to rent

63
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,209
an apartment first to  then make area

64
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,160
that week so that the

65
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,030
stench passes anyway this manga in braking

66
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,200
very high temperature bubbles and and bubbles

67
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,500
again and bubbles slowly the foam

68
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,080
becomes clearer and

69
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,709
denser up to this situation here in

70
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:09,500
which it is probably the right situation

71
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,470
to make  see this thing here so

72
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,569
what happens I also hear

73
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,510
the audio you probably don't have

74
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,700
this situation of an infernal marble

75
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,170
that boils at absurd temperatures until

76
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,040
it gradually becomes more and more solid

77
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,540
and at this point we need to

78
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,630
start mixing in this

79
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,760
situation must be removed from the heat

80
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,860
with the whole because otherwise it becomes

81
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,750
crunchy which is another thing we

82
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,310
see dop  or because you have a few

83
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,760
minutes then in storage it is

84
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,609
removed from the heat and we find ourselves having to

85
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:49,130
carry out this type of operation

86
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,140
which is to mix then mix with the

87
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,840
almonds on the fire and when you see that

88
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,420
it melts too much that you do the

89
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,000
liquid part on the  fund this must be removed from the

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,609
fire to collect in practice

91
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:07,340
I send them to make them a shoe then when

92
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,579
it is melted it takes off the heat to

93
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:12,739
collect the sugar and a little at a

94
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:14,390
time today it comes from four everything

95
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,600
is what

96
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,560
we all do and therefore yes  mix with

97
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,180
what's left is basically

98
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,490
this the first times I did it I

99
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,919
was left with a lot of makeup with a

100
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,950
minimum of experience comes this thing

101
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,479
here for which it lends even little events is

102
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:38,450
a setting that observes hammer and

103
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,610
chisel to clean the pan

104
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,610
or simply  water and

105
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,380
time factor because sugar dissolves

106
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,460
that water luckily and the result is

107
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,470
this photo but a little darker than

108
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,210
q  what it should be because I

109
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,760
did with photography it is not clear

110
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,330
that taking pictures while working is

111
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,710
just one thing always a so this

112
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,200
is a question is something that usually

113
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,710
square today took it

114
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,590
to a client because I went away

115
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,430
I kept it  some for me when you eat

116
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,330
mondello pleasantly this thing

117
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,470
are much better than those

118
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,250
found at the fair

119
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,780
in the sense that these things are

120
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,570
also bought in some way here be careful

121
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,150
they burn they burn they discover then

122
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,710
put they surface is

123
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,380
not possible even so that they reach

124
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,890
room temperature before  to eat them

125
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,860
after which one says something I do with

126
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,550
all this doubt here what do I do

127
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,060
for a long time white blue that I took it are two

128
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,580
ounces of sugar here in the background there

129
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,180
were two ounces of almonds this

130
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,010
shiny photo of being because it is a double

131
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,120
in this  if I personally prefer to

132
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,190
send them for the long time it was

133
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,110
a bit boring job because they must be taken

134
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,330
individually for less  not to give us a

135
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,630
demo once they made half

136
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,010
a kilo of macondo cutting boards so as to

137
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,710
cut in one stroke only 5 for

138
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,150
the long one you can also do it with

139
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,280
whole almonds or with chopped almonds

140
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,360
this according to personal preferences

141
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,700
to me brutally  like them this

142
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,880
way so what happens then that you

143
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,480
put everything still are the same

144
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,630
doses are 100 g of sugar for every 100

145
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,930
grams of dried fruit and an ocean of

146
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,160
water in this case we have already

147
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,550
added to the water so what

148
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,910
also happens this  photo with an

149
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,680
unfair right because I realized the

150
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,020
mistake before lighting the fire

151
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,190
the water looks like an era because you can only do

152
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,050
a kilo of pumpkin in a spoonful

153
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,980
of water

154
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,900
we don't really do that much but

155
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,390
we just need to get it done otherwise point

156
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,210
it is  just to wait another

157
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,490
important thing is to prepare yourself as

158
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,170
you can see here this photo there must

159
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,340
have been no wrong water misery behind the

160
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,620
parchment paper because when it is crunchy it

161
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,280
comes out  about 850 gr

162
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,160
adida from the aluminum pan must

163
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,590
be on the parchment paper otherwise

164
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,740
whatever in place one carbonizes it two

165
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,900
does not come off anymore then just put it

166
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,360
on a classic cutting board finish with it check

167
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,340
that you will eat plastic and sugar in

168
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,410
equal parts then carefully

169
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,670
prepare the surface to  start

170
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,980
here I exaggerated a little more for two ounces

171
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,590
in the end you can see it took me a

172
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,620
little less and it is once again a

173
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,200
thing that boils allnet boils and then it started it

174
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,020
will go dark and put the one says oh god

175
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,870
my eyes burn

176
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,450
this time  I'm dying oh my it's hot

177
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,290
on 28 hands co2 pot holders better 3 the

178
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,690
temperature is very high this point one

179
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,550
says ex q it's

180
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,130
not enough let's go on like this instead it's

181
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,910
nice dark no it's not enough here this

182
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,460
was enough I don't remember if it's the last

183
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,290
one too it's a  like reason a

184
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,270
liquid phase in which it is just a nice

185
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,850
dark completely liquid broth

186
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,370
who knows it burns the eyes a

187
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,460
horrible thing but currently to get the

188
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,140
c  good things you always need to make a

189
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,630
certain effort there is this effort of

190
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,740
reaching it

191
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,700
the beautiful thing is then this

192
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,880
is finally more or less the right coloring to

193
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,409
be good at not being able to even salt

194
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,320
a spoonful of this sugar but do

195
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,690
not care  a lot and at this point

196
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,050
you take it down you turn off the heat and don't take it

197
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,340
down the recipe cocer says with half a

198
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:55,910
lemon

199
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,420
because it doesn't stick on the lemon and

200
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,990
gives us that minimum of robinho that doesn't hurt us

201
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,320


202
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,270
unfortunately when I tried with

203
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,200
lemon  I always got annoyed

204
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,590
with lemon thumb so I do it with two

205
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,120
spoons which unfortunately we will sell at the

206
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,890
counter with a little encrusted with sugar and

207
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,810
filing them in the end there is a bit of

208
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,290
sugar even once the procedure is

209
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,810
hammer and chisel or water and how

210
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,490
long they count  always it is the result

211
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,870
is this

212
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,890
of this you do not see it is a full chopping board

213
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,720
plus a little bit about this

214
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,170
sheet taste hot and soft they were

215
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,350
terrible chorus if you try to detach it from

216
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,060
for  no it comes from a ridge you have a disaster in your

217
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,310
hand wait for the iris at

218
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,920
room temperature

219
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,089
but

220
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:56,329
if you are in sicily in puglia you put it

221
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,209
in a bowl and all happy if you are

222
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,939
in lombardy puts it closed because

223
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:05,149
it drinks water an evening with

224
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:07,459
some  friends I had my barter the cap with the

225
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,189
cap I put it in the middle of the table but

226
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:12,290
two hours of chat in which everyone

227
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,480
discharged it seems the cap was enough for

228
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,360
a kind of rubber half a finger is enough to

229
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,370
press on five because simple carla

230
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,180
a really horrible thing so

231
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,180
when it was temperature mind close it

232
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,120
if you live in an unhealthy place 6b letters

233
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,029
in a healthy place here I would say that to esc

234
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:35,649
the humid of those swamps dc to the tent

235
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:40,209
they say or eat immediately or if it closes

236
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:43,610
sterile and closed environment this is the

237
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,180
result of

238
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,309
the dishes  they are not standard they are a little

239
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:49,279
bigger than a normal dish these

240
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,410
are three ounces of dried fruit contracted

241
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,779
of sugar these are two ounces of

242
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,110
almonds with two types of tuk this is

243
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,319
u  n another list that the same thing and

244
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:02,980
I hope I have balanced the polytechnics

245
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,470
of the first presentation with a

246
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,689
presentation that I hope you will not look

247
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:11,360
at 2 because this already took

248
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,449
about half the expected time thanks

249
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,090
thanks

250
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,090
ruby here is the time to get ready and

251
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,860
brats emanuele sugary  I

252
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,770
started at 12 00 and I finished

253
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,710
12 and 12 so he said I'm afraid almost to

254
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,570
do it in real time except then to

255
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,130
position the camera etc.

256
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,230


257
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,390


258
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,920


259
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,320
and to pop it may

260
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,850
take a while so time is

261
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,130
still much faster than what it

262
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,480
seems to

263
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,420
find the first time if it gets bad

264
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,160
eat it alone and so the second

265
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,340
time it is better you can give it to

266
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,480
friends or follow this  politics I do a

267
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,910
lot of tests between the toucan it is bad

268
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,740
if there is a good ingredients I eat everything

269
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,600
myself and I don't know that no one

270
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,490
even I suffer because I ran out of

271
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,880
lawn once  thank you then let's see if

272
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,190
anyone has any questions if not we are

273
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,580
one also this time

274
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,160
well together with the next question is the

275
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,730
question that the next aiscat

276
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,910
says yes I surely then had

277
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,460
done on the chat I am more like a razor

278
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,340
than the ex is a  solo chat perote

279
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,300
the allegro male is a

280
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,820
90's rock the year I have a slow machine that

281
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,240
works well for the boxes the

282
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,650
debian package has a

283
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,780
default configuration that I don't like my

284
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,820
configuration of the built over the

285
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,430
years so that's okay

286
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,850
I demand my privacy only my choice

287
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,650
the window manager there is a question on the

288
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,140
chat

289
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:06,110
this was from a massive use

290
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,130
maybe you also do those on the chat

291
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,220
because I still feel clicks or

292
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,630
on the download it follows

293
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,880
not only because everything else follows if

294
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,850
you also feel not  necessarily if I

295
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,920
sing about shoes to munch a

296
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,020
friend of mine is an elite pastry chef that

297
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,360
pastry is practically chemical

298
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,880
so you have to do everything with sling bars

299
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,550
right programs how do you do

300
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,170
things eye

301
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,800
well I can only like you do I

302
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,500
miss the second half doing the things

303
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,530
I have

304
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:59,799
well in the east surely the faces then the

305
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,689
fools worried a tour in the oven

306
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:06,440
or many other good things  to do here in the

307
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,960
east because there will be if there will be the former

308
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,290
thing that still seems to me not quite

309
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,890
this is not not yet sure yes

310
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,950
everything then ruby and that we thank a

311
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,410
lot for this a little particular

312
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,660
will open the series of bulls in  he cooks with

313
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,880
ruby

314
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,320
[Music]

315
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,110
and then obviously if there will be

316
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,320
skyrocketing we are waiting for you with the role you cook from the

317
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,100
east

318
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,190
okay I heard meta but I guess

319
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,529
what was said

320
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:47,100
thank you all
