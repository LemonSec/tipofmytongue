1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:02,730
so when he asked me to do

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,319
something like this a first

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,870
word I said is here and a bit of visual

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,080
as a real term is contact rising

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,870
becoming a theme a bit of a visual

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,000
non-computer tail, I tell you that in the

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,369
next few days it will  it will be even more

8
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:19,050
there were signs even today

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,820
about regions that they would like to

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,850
pull back but I said yes and

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,369
the visuals but we can not like you and that is

12
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,260
as people we also say were

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,880
aware in fact we also saw it

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,410
in the title in the app  struct

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,840
geeks aware not to talk about a

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,790
theme and in any case challenging from a technological point of

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,260
view

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,600
the solution to face is not to

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,940
say no we do not do the tracking but

20
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,980
we find it in the best possible way or

21
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,539
let's sit down for the

22
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,280
best thing we know how to do

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,899
first of all  as human beings then

24
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,300
also as geeks and we find a way

25
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,840
to do it and safeguarding what

26
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,940
are of the things that we say in at least

27
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,609
in our country are a  fact

28
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,190
or civil personal liberties

29
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,099
privacy and so on

30
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,990
therefore I move on to this thing

31
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,659
so sorry if I go ahead and see

32
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,590
the bar below analysis reflections

33
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,659
for and against about different technologies

34
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,470
the first point is to

35
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,000
make a distinction  quite

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,920
important it will be very fast between data

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,130
information data substantially is

38
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,829
something that is raw i.e. a

39
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,229
typical example of data is basically a

40
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,189
couple road data from a hard disk or a

41
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,110
series of temperature measurements without

42
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,880
knowing where how when and why

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,590
the information something  more

44
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,549
important

45
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,530
and when we can practically give

46
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,640
a meaning to some data

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,380
also writing technically

48
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,600
human language is a given therefore we must find

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,189
written letters which are given

50
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,500
the information is when a theme is applied

51
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,049
therefore of the meaning to that

52
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,689
series of data  so this is the first

53
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,460
thing not to collect data to

54
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,090
get information in the cas  or

55
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,878
comite 19 miss of this we are talking about

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,949
and we are talking about a pathologist

57
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,470
therefore substantially from the epidemiological point of

58
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,750
view we have to talk about

59
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,010
a very specific thing we must

60
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,340
be able to understand

61
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,750
whether or not it is a positive infected person who

62
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,690
came into contact with someone else if

63
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,460
we discover  that a person to me for

64
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,220
example is positive but in

65
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,860
the last month I have been playing online and

66
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,930
have been barricaded at home it is not a

67
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,920
problem

68
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,300
the problem is if I had gone to

69
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,890
work, had gone to the grocery store and

70
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,550
so on

71
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,260
then basically  I have to do

72
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,680
this and then I need to

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,490
find what data I need to get

74
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,750
the information

75
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,880
let's go back to the previous version of the

76
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,560
contact so if there has been a

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,960
propagation something but not exempt to

78
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,200
also say that every time a measurement is made

79
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,240
that  is a bit of a scientist like

80
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,100
these when you do when you want to

81
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,020
get information you have to understand

82
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,690
the type of measurement to be done is really u  n

83
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,130
design when you do an

84
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,930
experiment I have to design also the

85
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,790
measure I have to do otherwise I don't do it

86
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,770
I do an example I don't need to

87
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,060
know the time of day

88
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,100
if I have to measure the length of the table

89
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,470
here we say in first order of

90
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,000
approximation it is something that  I don't

91
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,180
need one, let's say so

92
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,100
zealous as to want to take all the data in the

93
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,380
outline but to take a

94
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,600
table length you don't need anything other than

95
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,270
that length so in the context of

96
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,330
telling him in the epidemiological field as

97
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,120
I said before to trace for the purpose of

98
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,350
that  that we want to do then

99
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,330
establish if there has been contact with

100
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,180
someone and warn him go to test

101
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,270
and avoid that he himself carries that infection elsewhere

102
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,200
that positivity

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,480
what interests us is a measure and

104
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,850
it is not the time of day the contact place

105
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,040
is  closeness or knowing if

106
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,620
another person and I don't care where I

107
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,230
don't care when

108
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,209
we have been difficult in the last period of time

109
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,820
or as the epidemiology experts also tell us

110
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,490
about a meter

111
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,860
however a few meters between two people

112
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,810
this I can get it in two ways

113
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,700
mainly I can get it by doing

114
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,169
something a bit in quotation marks

115
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,780
resolved so practically I take the

116
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,480
positions of all the people and started to

117
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,030
calculating the geometric distance between

118
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,330
all the people part

119
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,130
computationally would be a disaster

120
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,200
when we can talk anyway it would be

121
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,300
a stuff equal to the number of users for

122
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,830
the number of users minus one of everything

123
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,120
you only have to and therefore we talk that

124
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,610
computationally it would be quite

125
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,110
wasteful completely useless to do so

126
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,900
or you can do different ways and

127
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,720
here we are talking about the various various

128
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,250
techniques which, moreover, have also

129
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,740
come out a little more or less in the

130
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,310


131
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,910
public debate regarding going to

132
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,440
verify and obtain this data or this

133
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,680
concept of closeness and therefore we

134
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,450
will see there are the approaches po  more inefficient

135
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,250
not even harmful to the ra  i the inter va

136
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,280
privacy and from others where it is constant to

137
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,020
have some risk because the walls are

138
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,930
not free from risks or from possible flow

139
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,730
imperfections let's see what

140
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,280
these scenarios are and also see how

141
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,220
the solution of

142
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,440
good such as  the one certainly the

143
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,090
best in the relationship between hosts fur

144
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,770
ripa that has not had with trento

145
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,110
looked out on the old public a

146
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,160
few weeks ago when they said

147
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,140
40 percent of people but I remember

148
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,140
that spiritual and that of the favorite

149
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,810
of surveillance lovers

150
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,540
just have one  excuse direct

151
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,340
romanist

152
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,040
excuse me after we have for the person

153
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,160
who would have microphone on sorry here is

154
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,890
perfect place no I thought something

155
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,330
worse I said I said something

156
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,160
very serious it is precisely that via

157
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,310
cellular network is practically one as they

158
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,800
say rivera who pirates like

159
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,600
mass surveillance  absolutely loved

160
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,700
it is easily achievable

161
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,010
already infrastructure is ready

162
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,710
enough  calling the telcos that have the

163
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,160
network, that is the cellular network, telling them damage

164
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,190
to localization data

165
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,690
from a regulatory point of view would be a

166
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,400
bloodbath I would like to say

167
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,750
because legislative devices already exist

168
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,550
but they are made on the mandate

169
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,110
of the judiciary for the location

170
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,540
of people in the field of  give us bla bla

171
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,460
bla all the things we know as a

172
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,340
wiretapper and therefore it would be

173
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,050
really terrible stuff to do it

174
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,440
would be extremely invasive

175
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,220
of the personal sphere because it would not be

176
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,020
optional that is having a cell phone

177
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,060
would not lead to being treated

178
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,160
but the final data would be the most interesting data.

179
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,020
fact that it is not

180
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,080
for nothing but it would not be

181
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,470
useful at all for the purposes of contact racing in

182
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,240
the epidemiological field,

183
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,200
speaking of a few meters away and the

184
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,970
data via cellular network is a given

185
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,700
that approximations of more or less 100

186
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,310
meters someone 50 is fine in

187
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,770
urban area but in an already extra-urban area

188
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,390
where they also thin out  and the number of

189
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,960
cells are even more cells also are

190
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,790
clowns than the cells and it becomes a

191
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,740
precision it becomes extremely lasko

192
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,630
so knowing that people are in the

193
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,360
same cell that measures km let's say it

194
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,910
would create me a number of

195
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,100
an incredible number of false positives

196
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,260
would only be in my opinion  a great

197
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,040
deterrent

198
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,840
is now there but it would have absolutely

199
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,310
no value to obtain then

200
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,460
the information that derives from the point

201
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,650
of view of the racing contract or

202
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,930
go back to the contact networks go and

203
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,940
warn them limit what is an

204
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,540
outbreak do not let it start at all

205
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,490
then  this we say to their athletes

206
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,230
under immediate would have a very

207
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,670
simple realization they

208
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,280
could have done on that day after it had

209
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,190
been decided time to adjust the collection systems to po

210
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,490


211
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,960
the second day situation via

212
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,299
gps app this I have not checked

213
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,030
very well somewhere it has been

214
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,400
used  perhaps he thinks the kitchen was used

215
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,880
ie side to make us all the position

216
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,370
of the  given via gps then gps glonass

217
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,690
that such constellations such leo

218
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,780
viabilities we have large data of great

219
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,910
levels of accuracy now we are about 5

220
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,800
meters something less in the open field

221
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,840
in excellent situations with all

222
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,510
systems of a device that sees all

223
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,720
the localization systems

224
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,230
global but obviously some

225
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,690
contraindications has first of all that it is

226
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,420
unusable or would create unreliable data

227
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,480
indoor spaces

228
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,550
very ugly interior spaces or in particular urban environments

229
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,410
such as the canyon effect for

230
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,940
those who know it therefore very

231
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,130
narrow streets high buildings there is limited visibility

232
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,680
of the sky and  therefore also the

233
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,660
number of satellites would be

234
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,370
particularly intrusive because in

235
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,130
any case we are trying to know if

236
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,470
another person was nearby

237
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,840
we do not care if it was at

238
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,240
that person's house because I am his lover or

239
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,670
because we were doing something but we are

240
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,410
interested in knowing  from the point of view to the

241
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,970
point of view of public health

242
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,970
only c  he was therefore

243
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,530
practically close and requires a

244
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,490
collaboration anyway from the

245
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,320
user the generalization through

246
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,460
accelerates a little that is already going

247
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,080
too long localization through

248
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,390
immune apps this is a system the prix

249
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,580
of a pact between population state or

250
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,770
an app is created  that it must be

251
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,860
easy to use, that it works and that it

252
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,990
only collects the information that is needed

253
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,270
or the proximity between people not where

254
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,010
not when not because

255
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,110
absolutely nothing so only that

256
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,150
portion of data the easiest way to

257
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,450
do it via say bluetooth so

258
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,820
basically the exchange of codes

259
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,800
univocal that are ephemeral and therefore

260
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,400
change continuously

261
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,920
each one I go on every 15 minutes but

262
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,260
because soldiers are technical quarrels I do not know

263
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,270
how much these have been set here

264
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,080
there is an exchange of reciprocal announcements there

265
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,260
I am here I am here at that moment

266
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,480
when then everyone there  evening he comes home

267
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,690
they have a list of people he

268
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,960
came in contact with and he comes with  Faced

269
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,520
with a list provided to the

270
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,580
National Health Service of those of these

271
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,580
completely anonymous rand on ice codes

272
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,470
that have tested positive

273
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,870
now in my cell phone in my belly my

274
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,820
cell phone this comparison between the list

275
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,180
of people I met and that

276
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,850
of the positive ones results in  goods

277
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,490
within Homeric informals we

278
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,160
will see what the procedure will be because they are

279
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,050
rationalists to have come into

280
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,380
contact with a person who was then

281
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,750
positive so here do a little quick

282
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,570
because we have told

283
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,590
everyone this in these days so the system is

284
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,790
decentralized the comparison between the

285
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,490
list occurs within each

286
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,630
mobile phone

287
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,980
there is a risk you will hear about

288
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,870
some newspapers for the site there is a

289
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,590
vulnerability that this paparazzi attack

290
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:01,120
is inherent in the protocol over the months the

291
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,130
type of tracing that has been done

292
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,160
in making it decentralized the list  of the

293
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,880
gt positive results is for by design

294
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,130
it is not possible to make otherwise public

295
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,800
so it can e  to be used to do

296
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,820
something with it

297
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,010
this scenario deserves more time but

298
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,620
if you are looking for a little tapestry in the park or

299
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,110
here I leave the link here a lot

300
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,640
or we keep it at the moment on

301
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,550
guitar there is after a lot of suffering there is

302
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,220
probably a good lapin code

303
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,160
something is missing from the back end it is true but

304
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,960
basically it has to do little

305
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,120
but there are the two

306
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,950
important themes which are those of the water

307
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,650
being of the android one so for those who

308
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,430
want to send it to see it can also go and

309
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,450
learn something from the point of

310
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,230
view of the apps

311
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,510
to the  beyond what can be in

312
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,180
immune ap1 the rela mobility can

313
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,890
run on the mobile phone then we see

314
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,200
at the moment it does not work I will also explain

315
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,040
why and there are obviously this

316
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,680
apple suggested it was particularly

317
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,700
intelligent the thing to go and

318
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,270
see a little leisure  one of those that

319
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,370
are not a lot of those that had

320
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,210
created a little more attention was

321
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,910
this one to remove this library

322
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,170
as it would allow u  n access to the

323
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,570
position even if with low granularity it

324
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,580
is true that is within a file

325
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,230
this file

326
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,390
this amount this free android

327
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,990
location location manager perfect

328
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,600
this 8 99 rightly makes them run

329
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,630
writes something probably had not

330
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,150
read everything about the new plans to

331
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:48,450
make bluetooth  low energy has three films

332
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,510
released by the people and in fact

333
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,520
one of the developers responds saying look at

334
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,320
this that must be in addition to must

335
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,700
be active because even bl the use

336
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,370
of b with bluetooth low energy requires

337
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,980
this stuff here whoever does this check and it

338
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,410
was right and documentary  if you go and

339
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,589
check but persevere is diabolical

340
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:13,650
we know it and therefore practically in

341
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,180
this 8 99 it is commendable to review and

342
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,459
open skis but also not to give opinions

343
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,370
but it has inherited I'm sorry a little

344
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,200
scientist inside so me miss

345
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,730
using this library could

346
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,040
lead to following  attack with

347
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,589
malicious code executions a

348
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:34,200
terrible thing without a line of code e

349
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,810
say he is sure he replies again the

350
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,350
nice the good developer I think if

351
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,279
he explains it well from the band school and

352
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,560
in the end obviously sorry I got

353
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,600
the reference wrong even if parties so

354
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,329
let's say

355
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:51,989
in the end they are also resolved in a

356
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:54,790
timely manner this also interesting if

357
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,220
you go to  see this stuff from you the up

358
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,319
surely won't work them will succeed

359
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:02,049
this notification in a toast in the

360
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:04,629
enough part of the application and notifications of

361
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:07,209
inactive exposure

362
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:08,829
have opened it a few people so it

363
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:11,379
was opa was one of these

364
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,959
but rightly laughs manor forst

365
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,959
we know it  always of the rhythm absolutely

366
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,699
and in the reins it was clearly written

367
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:22,389
that that function is activated by

368
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,989
google canvas allows on those on the deed

369
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:28,329
only when you have been approved from the

370
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:30,369
point of view of being a governmental

371
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:32,350
therefore substantially there is also this

372
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,199
second step that applies  google and caio

373
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,040
they also apple pardon in their respective

374
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,009
operating systems to validate who is

375
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,809
using the nu  where functions implemented

376
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,389
for contract racing via bluetooth it

377
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:52,149
is already valid to that if it is

378
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:54,339
recognized as the national team for

379
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:56,559
contact racing so let's say about this

380
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,480
I think they have some technical times I

381
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,759
do not know at what point they are and this is a

382
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,230


383
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,879
very nice reproducibility on reproducibility  because

384
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,009
practically when one has a software

385
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,629
you see it many times in the download

386
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:12,910
other than 5 meters but when one

387
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,040
tries to restore it to recompile it

388
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,489
will never come out but the same ash itself

389
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:20,110
then there are claims procedures

390
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,029
to say look if you withdraw it

391
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:24,220
as we did it with the same chain

392
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,699
same compiler distro and so on

393
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:29,799
you will get the same developments from this is

394
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,629
a nice thing to do it should be done

395
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:33,779
in general on many software products i

396
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:38,259
go very fast and steal a minute and

397
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:40,269
some news for future generations

398
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:41,860
who had not spoken the things we

399
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,649
knew how to do instead in my opinion is one

400
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:46,720
of the beautiful things that would have been

401
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,220
oppor  tuno to do even in parallel

402
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,689
with an act that is

403
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:52,600
immediately needed was to use some

404
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,489
new technology we always talk how they

405
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:56,199
always pay that decades old stuff

406
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:58,449
but let's say that now in the IT field it is

407
00:16:58,449 --> 00:16:59,889
starting to be

408
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:01,839
particularly used and it would have

409
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,020
been appropriate to test it or one for

410
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,539
example to use what these

411
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:09,490
I don't explain if anyone wants to make

412
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,339
another episode and use 01

413
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:14,169
Russian logic you can go and see them there is

414
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:15,970
a page on the pc pedia del taken

415
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,740
this diagram which is beautiful because it

416
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,109
allows you to do some checks even by

417
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,609
centralizing things probably

418
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,898
though  research should be done without

419
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:28,388
having an information discourse therefore

420
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:30,130
practically with all technologies and

421
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,909
all one if it is an area of research

422
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:36,639
on these 09 purpose where you can

423
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,799
do tests without having

424
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,539
the information available in this case

425
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:42,190
there probably could have been

426
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,779
some use

427
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:45,290
the second

428
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,210
that I am accepted  are the fiom orphic writing

429
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,270
this is already

430
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,850
in use in a few years in the medical field is very

431
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,040
much a daughter because practically I can

432
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,670
upload my data to the cloud and

433
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,120
do operations from the cloud in the cloud

434
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,740
on my data without these being

435
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,080
decoded so I  I can

436
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,450
operate operations one could it as the

437
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,340
product of distances what I

438
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,890
need on encrypted data without

439
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,960
ever having given it clear this is very

440
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,090
interesting because if you remember what

441
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,490
morimoto said he should compute

442
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,620
distances but he would need the

443
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,660
positions of the people who  it is detrimental

444
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,970
to people's privacy to know where they

445
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,650
have been but instead an audio system

446
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,860
dead condominiums I can tell me and mario

447
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,710
we have been and lucia have been close

448
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,810
we have been within 30 centimeters of each

449
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,550
other but without knowing where if the

450
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,160
knowing when to  something

451
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,460
interesting here too is a

452
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,500
recent technology then I found someone is already in

453
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,870
unsuspected times had  precisely thought about

454
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,630
the use of water

455
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,630
morphic cryptography to compute the

456
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,060
proximity and then make clusters and in the

457
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,850
field of social networks such as talking

458
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,560
about social networks of the ubiquity of

459
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,290
mobile phones and how to go and find

460
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,090
how close people are without

461
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,830
going to invade  their privacy so

462
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,540
there was a publication was a good

463
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,730
starting point to do it I'm very

464
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,310
fast on this there are these are the

465
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,830
references I think I did a

466
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:21,040
roundup perhaps a little confusing but

467
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:32,710
ok thanks a lot to note that thanks layer

468
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,700
d '  gold for having you accept only small

469
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,860
we are tonight in short there is the space

470
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:47,860
left in the right minutes and there is

471
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,340
space however for the columns and therefore I

472
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,070
invite you as he used to write questions in

473
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,520


474
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:01,340
our chat then less see them ask

475
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,900
[Music]

476
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,800
in case of telephone with the moment the

477
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,120
answer I do not know does not seem to me so

478
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,000
take it with a grain of salt there is a check

479
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,120
from that point of view so there

480
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,190
should not usually be checks  are

481
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,950
if the smartphone is rotated well something

482
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,320
is forced so

483
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,360
unless I foresee it in the app

484
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:34,360
it is not there so I do not know on mobile phones that

485
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,490
are not android so what do I know all

486
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:41,280
line and joyce or others who do not  have

487
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,810
let's say they don't come their own

488
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,120
android trend and released to google if

489
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,520
there will be the availability of the t ae that

490
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,030
have been implemented later on

491
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,470
everyone in the last update

492
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,470
everyone has arrived matteo tells me of a

493
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,950


494
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,620
certain foreigner who is however and  this type of

495
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,330
app for me is absolutely not a

496
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,010
problem like you who are tracking

497
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,790
more now being only on this server

498
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,920
or on google drive where I made the

499
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,200
presentation to repeat there is a trade

500
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,150
off as always

501
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,970
how many the cost benefit ratio what

502
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,370
am I  objectively sacrificing to the

503
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,510
limit I am sacrificing the fact that I

504
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,420
have been close to someone anonymous

505
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,730
that it is difficult to derive who can

506
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,430
be substantially

507
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,510
perfect therefore a loss of lib  I have to

508
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,400
say infinitesimal freedom compared to what

509
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,260
could be the well-being of the

510
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,430
community then they are personal choices

511
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,490
so much so that it remains personal but from

512
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,350
shared technical not even being able to

513
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,810
say today as someone but of hamas and

514
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,840
then truly open code if there is good

515
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,720
will  to do it you hear the code

516
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,440
you check then wanting to be

517
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,010
pedantic and also what because it will be

518
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,770
on the stores and at that point I have to say I

519
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,240
see it difficult to do

520
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:20,050
something else under provision

521
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,450
no it is not just a

522
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,130
practically bad predisposition and allows to

523
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,180
of the apps that have

524
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,980
the decree allowed I haven't seen it well

525
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,870
yet but google practically has to

526
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,260
enable that act for you and had to do a

527
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,060
filing yes definitely

528
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,300
and to make it work and make me

529
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,240
use those more on 32 it comes out well

530
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,010
all those who currently have the

531
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,800
version 6 maybe even something before

532
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,090
in the end they made but from version

533
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:49,990
6 of android

534
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,230
then it is about everyone that is but asp

535
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,760
ttate that I see even if I can

536
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:04,210
show you settings it seems on

537
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,750
settings

538
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,080
here it is

539
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:18,450
let's try to loosen the brightness a little

540
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,030
wait let's see if you see

541
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,530
here they are notifications related to the co pid

542
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,300
and now I already have it installed as you can

543
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:36,900
see in its enabled so you

544
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,850
can not  to do and therefore it is always its

545
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,960
setting look for copit or

546
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,640
contact something and there is already on

547
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,950
everyone well other questions

548
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,450
andrea if the problem that you must always

549
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:01,120
keep active and bluetooth correct then

550
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,030
other questions about the percentage

551
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,860
of people who will install we talk about

552
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,150
the  60 percent because it is because if it is

553
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,060
useful using this number that

554
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,910
is said I feel like saying that

555
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:20,170
the effectiveness is proportional to the number of

556
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,540
people I just don't feel like saying a

557
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,810
different figure and certainly

558
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,180
that it is not the line  grandmother who all

559
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,620
day at home does not create a problem for me

560
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,300
so also searcher iula rhone and

561
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,660
ready that not android now oeste but

562
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,030
does not move from ca  knows not to the problem I

563
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,510
hope that the use I believe if these 60

564
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,220
percent but also 50 percent are

565
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,320
the people who move every day and

566
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,560
that for work or social reasons

567
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,590
bragging about seeing someone is more

568
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,170
useful than giving  a number between

569
00:24:53,170 --> 00:25:00,330
show m ok

570
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,670
yes absolutely yes

571
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,320
I repeat that is already that for example in the

572
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,060
new where I work everyone

573
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,950
probably has it a day when one a

574
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,050
should be positive it will

575
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,300
benefit me and vice versa if it is

576
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,840
positive the people who work

577
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,580
me it  they would have therefore both imagined there

578
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,409
will be a patchy behavior and

579
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:26,270
that is it could be that

580
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,429
we have mentioned two cells eighty

581
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:29,570
percent of people have installed it

582
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,429
other places where there has not been a

583
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:35,059
strong perception of the pandemic

584
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:38,330
where it will be installed that is  if

585
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,090
i don't want them in sardinia sardinia

586
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:45,049
very low author good i am

587
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:49,400
happy for them they will have 20 per cent

588
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,500
of installations it is not so much

589
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,200
serious problem  tourist flows

590
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,760
will go and people will go to Sardinia

591
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,559
probably they too will have the

592
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:01,070
right need to want to be

593
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,169
sure that there are contacts take

594
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:05,059
this let's say it's not very technical and

595
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:06,890
go and see how these

596
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,390
interactions on numbers will be
