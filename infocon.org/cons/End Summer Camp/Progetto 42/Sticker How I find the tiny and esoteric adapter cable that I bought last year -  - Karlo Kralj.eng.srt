00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,859
[Music]

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
um

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
space

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,320
let's switch to english and

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,879
i just made a small introduction

6
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,239
of you and the project so

7
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,920
here we go hi

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,280
uh i used to i was living out of a

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,640
backpack before

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
now i have more more space and more

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,079
stuff so i got stuff

12
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,520
i had to figure out a way to organize it

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
all because because i couldn't even find

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,800
things in my backpack

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,040
and this is what i came up with i have

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,840
these stickers

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,400
with numbers on them uh

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,360
yeah and i put the stickers on on things

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,520
like well that's not a good example um

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,200
like here's my keyboard it has a sticker

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,840
on it

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,720
and then i recorded my catalog where the

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,200
things are

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,119
but let's um yeah we can start with the

25
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,000
keyboard

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
so this is number three zero

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,759
four one

28
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,279
we can say um

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,200
oh

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,200
well let's do it this way sticker

31
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,399
we're gonna say three zero four one is a

32
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,880
trace

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,000
keyboard

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,040
now i can um stick or scan

35
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,520
and this lists everything in my catalog

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
and one of the things is the atreya's

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,599
keyboard

38
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,760
i i usually alias um

39
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,319
k k to sticker so i can do k scan

40
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,360
instead

41
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,720
and also i don't have to write out the

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:36,560
full command so i can do ksc

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,800
okay

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,280
that's not so interesting i i can

45
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,920
catalog

46
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,840
let's do another thing here's um an lto5

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,239
tape

48
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,440
ltl3 tape um

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,480
maybe you can see yeah and

50
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,000
i already put a sticker on this it's

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,840
number one one six zero

52
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,159
okay but um the whole point is that i

53
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,519
can find my things and if i just have a

54
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,519
list of things that's not so helpful

55
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,080
well as i think of my things things can

56
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,400
be inside of things

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,720
so this this tape here

58
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:33,840
well it's in box number oh

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,200
oh what was that

60
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
one one two two

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,000
do you see the sticker when i do this do

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
you see the number

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,360
yeah we can see good so

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,000
we're going to put the

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
okay we have the tape number one one six

66
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,439
zero

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,080
and it's going in box number this

68
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,840
this is box number one one two two

69
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,600
ah so i had not actually listed box

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
number one one two two

71
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,160
let's also do that

72
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,840
um this is a

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,880
these boxes are really cool they stack

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
and they nest

75
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,240
that's why they're called stack and nest

76
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,919
containers i

77
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,560
turn them around

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,080
how's that

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,120
okay now i have three items in my

80
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
catalog

81
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,000
um but there's also this one is flat

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,040
there's a hierarchy

83
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,400
yeah um i can do

84
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,638
uh

85
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,520
okay um let's do it

86
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,759
this way first i'll put both of those

87
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,320
options

88
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,440
okay this says that we have a box

89
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,600
number one one two two and inside of

90
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,960
that

91
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,880
is this number one one six zero

92
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,000
and you know we could put something

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
inside the tape

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,840
sort of we could say like um

95
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,800
i hope my spelling is correct

96
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,560
yeah it's correct okay

97
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,880
so what i'm doing here is i'm going to

98
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,840
say we're going to

99
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,280
add is that

100
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,520
oh good um we're going to put some

101
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,960
videos inside the tape

102
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,840
this push command does a few things in

103
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,240
one

104
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,800
it creates a new item and it assigns a

105
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,160
number

106
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,400
and because i didn't give it a number it

107
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,840
assigns a negative number and i use

108
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,440
negative numbers for things that don't

109
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,039
actually have stickers on them so i

110
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,199
i can't put a sticker on the data inside

111
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,039
the tape so instead

112
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,000
i um give it a negative number so now

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,800
when i do

114
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,120
the same members command i can see that

115
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,400
i have the backup

116
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,080
of the project

117
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,360
videos in

118
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,800
in the tape in the container

119
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,120
and i can have a lot

120
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,319
like now let's say

121
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,759
i have a lot of stuff in the database

122
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,280
now um

123
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,080
now i want to look up the backup so i

124
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,720
can

125
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,599
um i can use the pick command to search

126
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,240
for 42

127
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,120
and then i can

128
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,520
well that doesn't that doesn't do

129
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,240
anything

130
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,280
but then i can scan

131
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,639
scan that and then it'll tell me okay

132
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,160
yeah i do have that

133
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,720
and then i can locate

134
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,960
it tells me exactly the position

135
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
um and i can do it verbose so it tells

136
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,960
me all the

137
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,800
descriptions so now when i'm looking for

138
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,000
my data back up i say

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,759
okay the backup is on an lto3 tape

140
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,240
that lto3 tape is inside this container

141
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,080
and while i could also say this

142
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,280
container

143
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,840
um it's on a cart

144
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,199
this cart i don't have a number for the

145
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,319
car but i could say um

146
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,840
so i can

147
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,720
yeah yeah so now i know that i have

148
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,960
i'll do the other way i'm looking for my

149
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,159
video backup i i need to go

150
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,360
to the the cart then on the cart i need

151
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,800
to find number one one two two

152
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,880
and then inside that i have my tape

153
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,200
but i also have some other tapes in here

154
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,680
let's add them to the system

155
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,279
this is number one one five two

156
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,480
so we can say um there's actually a

157
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,800
concept

158
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,839
before i get there let me just summarize

159
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,519
what we've done so far

160
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,519
items um the you can pretend the data

161
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,120
structure is this

162
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,560
an item has a description a number

163
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,399
and a container number so this item is

164
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,399
lto3 tape

165
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,720
that's its description its number is one

166
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,080
one six zero

167
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,800
and its container number is one one two

168
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,040
two

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,519
in fact it's a little more complicated

170
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,120
because you because you have there are

171
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,800
instances in classes

172
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,760
um and the user interface you only

173
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,600
interact with instances but

174
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
in the back there's classes and that's

175
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,360
helpful for a reason you'll see right

176
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,240
now

177
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
so now i have my lto3 tape

178
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,360
um i can um

179
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,360
what's the command clone

180
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,800
clone one one six zero one one five two

181
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,839
okay now i have two lto3 tapes

182
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,320
and here's the other yeah and they're um

183
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,959
they're they're in different places

184
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,360
still um

185
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
but i let's this way might be a bit more

186
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
clear

187
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,720
but i can move them to the same place

188
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,800
okay but the other thing is since

189
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,800
they're um they actually share the same

190
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,519
description

191
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,160
so if i change the name the description

192
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,720
of

193
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,399
uh lto3 of the 1152 to like

194
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,200
um in a

195
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,079
plastic case

196
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,160
now they both have the same description

197
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,399
i can also give it dimensions

198
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,120
um

199
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,120
so i pretend everything's a box

200
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
in this case it is a box but you have

201
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,079
things that aren't boxes like this isn't

202
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,279
that boxy

203
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,200
but um there's in a box

204
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,519
as as far as sticker is concerned an

205
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,240
item has

206
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
inner dimensions and outer dimensions

207
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,279
um actually let's start with the um

208
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,640
let's start with this box

209
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,360
the outer dimensions of this box let's

210
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,399
say it's something

211
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,839
like i don't know 30 millimeters

212
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,480
i'll get two units later let's say it's

213
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,959
45 by 30

214
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,640
by 20.

215
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,959
um

216
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,000
oh that was the wrong one i meant to do

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,839
it with uh

218
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,920
and the inner dimensions we can say

219
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,720
they're 35 by

220
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,440
25 by 16.

221
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,360
16. ah shoot

222
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,240
outer is that

223
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,920
inner

224
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,000
okay now we'll add the

225
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,120
dimensions of the um

226
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,720
the inner dimensions of what you can put

227
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,560
inside the outer dimensions is what it

228
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,519
takes up

229
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,880
you can't put anything inside the tape

230
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,120
drive so we'll just say the outer

231
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,320
dimensions of the tape

232
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,519
are something like ten by ten by two

233
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,320
okay now um

234
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,440
we have a cool feature

235
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,480
what is it fits

236
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,600
okay well once i've specified

237
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,040
um the dimensions of

238
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,560
five two and one one two two then i can

239
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,920
run

240
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,160
fits and we'll find boxes that have

241
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,720
space for my item

242
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,079
and it will consider that

243
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,719
for example um

244
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,760
it'll consider that it needs enough

245
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
length and volume

246
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,279
it'll consider what else is it also

247
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,839
consider what else is in the box already

248
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,399
um yeah

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
did that dimensions thing make sense i

250
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,959
feel like it was kind of confusing

251
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,360
yeah it makes perfectly sense

252
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,320
cool uh let's see what else i should

253
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,800
talk about

254
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,959
okay

255
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,079
amy now i i started working on this

256
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,079
um or initially i just thought about the

257
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,440
data structure for like a year

258
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,639
and i i cataloged my stuff the catalog

259
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,320
was kind of like

260
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,440
kind of like this um i said something

261
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:31,839
like one five two

262
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
hmm

263
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
yeah and this is already really good

264
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,360
because in vim

265
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,279
or whatever text editor i could search

266
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:59,839
for oh yeah let's put the data back up

267
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,399
uh

268
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,160
yeah so when i'm looking for the videos

269
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,000
i could search for video

270
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,440
and then i could see its number negative

271
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,199
one then i could search for

272
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,399
um container number one one five two and

273
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,600
see that's it and then i can look for

274
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,800
its container

275
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,560
and i could trace all that but it was it

276
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
was also so it worked

277
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,079
um for for when it wasn't

278
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,399
it worked when it was a relatively

279
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,240
shallow hierarchy

280
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,959
um so actually

281
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,120
oh actually

282
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,680
and more on that later what was good

283
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,560
about this though is

284
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,160
because i didn't have any software to

285
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,639
maintain i could try out new things like

286
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,759
i had for a time i had an idea of um

287
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,320
it was borrowed from

288
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,759
and i could say this was borrowed from

289
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,519
number like one one four

290
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,920
four and i don't know one one four four

291
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,079
could have been

292
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,239
like

293
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,040
um alex mike my friend alex i don't know

294
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,000
um and i decided i didn't like that

295
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
feature but i was able to

296
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,320
to um try all this out now one problem

297
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,040
with this was

298
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,720
it was annoying to do queries that were

299
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,480
along hierarchy so i didn't actually do

300
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,199
it this way

301
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,279
i would actually do something like

302
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,000
instead of writing

303
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,519
instead of having all this hierarchy i

304
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,560
would really say something like um

305
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,839
like this

306
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,599
and also

307
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
uh

308
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,839
and then as i so i had to migrate all

309
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,040
this to my new system

310
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,959
and as i was doing this i realized there

311
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,079
was some some

312
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,520
commands that were just useful to have

313
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,799
like i wrote the commands for them i

314
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,799
kept them in the whole system so

315
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,480
if you ever did it started out this way

316
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,760
you'd have those same commands

317
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,119
and i was thinking this because that

318
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,319
explains some of the

319
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,240
the other things i was looking at here

320
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,439
so

321
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,199
um another thing we might want to do

322
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,840
which one should we talk about

323
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,679
so suppose i had that i had

324
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,280
oh it's frozen

325
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,200
do you still hear me yeah

326
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,720
okay you are not frozen

327
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,000
and uh it's okay everything's okay

328
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,080
and i have like three minutes left yeah

329
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,720
okay so maybe i'll uh so i had some cool

330
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,200
features

331
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,799
for that i thought that was a nice way

332
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,400
to do things i'll just run through a few

333
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,679
more features and then comment on

334
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,720
politics

335
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,480
um another thing i can do is attach

336
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,240
images or whatever i can

337
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,440
so i can say what do i want to do

338
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,039
i don't know well it's not relevant but

339
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,799
just as an example

340
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,720
so that and then i can

341
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,840
and actually there's a this this is like

342
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,799
very

343
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,160
well tuned to um if i want to scan

344
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,720
things

345
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,280
so they're all like oh they're all these

346
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,799
little features that work out well

347
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,919
for um cataloging things um i guess i

348
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,440
shouldn't go into all the details

349
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,480
um but yeah so i was doing this

350
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
originally it was just for me

351
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,000
um and then i noted uh

352
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,080
thing i noted was it's really easy for

353
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,240
me to find things a lot of other people

354
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,160
like i'm around a lot of pretty normal

355
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,000
people not hackers nowadays which is

356
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,679
kind of new for me

357
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,720
and a lot of them use amazon prime and

358
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,400
i never understood why people use it

359
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,080
because it's so expensive and the stuff

360
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,039
isn't very good

361
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,960
but now i think i understand now i think

362
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,320
one of the reasons is because they don't

363
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,600
have their own inventory management

364
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,960
system so instead they

365
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,480
outsource that to amazon and so they get

366
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,440
these disposable goods instead of

367
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:25,919
whatever

368
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,000
stuff they find on the street or get in

369
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
bulk or whatever

370
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,480
and uh i think it'd be cool if we or if

371
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:32,799
we

372
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,720
if we would uh maintain our own

373
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,640
inventories then we would um

374
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,679
not have to have the centralized

375
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,039
internet retailer where we get things

376
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,320
from or i don't really use it but yeah

377
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,320
and and like then you could

378
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,520
you could trade with your neighbors you

379
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,960
know um

380
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,400
let's see another another um

381
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,600
another thought i had while i was making

382
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,360
this i always want i always cared that

383
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,000
it'd be very um

384
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,760
a way it diff differs probably from how

385
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,159
retailers do it

386
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,080
i always care that it'd be easy to

387
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,360
install because

388
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
that's like otherwise i won't use my own

389
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,360
software and that it'd be

390
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
robust to failure in different ways and

391
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
in particular

392
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,120
um in this case it needed to work

393
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,960
without electricity

394
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,159
so i have a way of of printing out um

395
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,640
yeah i can print out the

396
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,120
and you know because printers never work

397
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,000
i have a receipt

398
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,120
printer and i can send this to my

399
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,918
receipt printer

400
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,039
[Applause]

401
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,840
i should

402
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,879
yeah so there's the printer i'll do it

403
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,559
again

404
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,760
yeah and this has a

405
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,280
um if it's like a search engine but it

406
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,640
you know

407
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,400
it's a paper so we call it an index the

408
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,159
so you can look up you can look up the

409
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,840
word you want here

410
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,080
like i can't read it

411
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,120
um stack video whatever

412
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,200
and then on this other section well you

413
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,640
can you can run the command for yourself

414
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:28,880
and

415
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,559
see how it works um

416
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,320
yeah uh okay

417
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,280
i guess that's time

418
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,280
okay we are perfectly in time over 21

419
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,480
minutes so that is

420
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,039
our standard just um

421
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,320
one note and one question the note is

422
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,400
that this system could be useful also

423
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,159
for aquaspaces

424
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,200
that's the reason why we

425
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,840
somehow decided to present this on the

426
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,559
projector

427
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,440
particular and the question is about

428
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,200
the license

429
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,320
and this is a free software of course

430
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,919
i yes i i need to put the license on the

431
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,679
software so that you're sure of it

432
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,440
i still haven't gotten around to writing

433
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,000
it i'll do it properly like fsf says and

434
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,520
put it in every single file and

435
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,200
put the license just the right way but

436
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
uh affirmative new public license

437
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,400
okay and if you can write down

438
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,080
some quick reference about where to find

439
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,720
the software

440
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,240
there okay so i believe

441
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,440
we have everything and a big thank to

442
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,919
you

443
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,799
carlo to uh participate uh for

444
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,840
participating

445
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,000
in uh projector currently talks

446
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,080
thank you
