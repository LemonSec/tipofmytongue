1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:03,210
perfect yes yes yes yes perfect perfect

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,790
then it's

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,950
basically fine in the end oh well we

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,389
had some setbacks due to

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:10,460
traffic

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,500
etc. etc. then onion mail is a

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,550
mail server simply made to

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,689
work on the tor network but

9
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:23,340
basically you don't lose the

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,840
ability to communicate  with internet users

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,560
at exit nodes which at this

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,830
moment are every mail point info and mx

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,920
thor point yz which practically take

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,050
care of taking messages

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,910
arriving from the internet transfer them to thor

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,559
and vice versa quite

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,370
transparently uses

18
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,149
file system encryption is  practically all the

19
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,620
messages that arrive in the box are

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,090
encrypted with various

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,750
cryptographic algorithms such as various times aes 256

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,690
hc 256 and serpent and then it seems to me even

23
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,939
if then there is also a passage of rsa

24
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,430
directly with an asymmetric key

25
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,830
for each user account so that  if

26
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,260
server is hacked there is

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,030
practically no possibility of having

28
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,830
private keys eg  r go and read

29
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,140
the users inbox which not

30
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,549
even the system administrator can do

31
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:21,869
unless he goes to modify the

32
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,820
source etcetera etcetera obviously you

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,159
can go up to a certain point the

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,619
funny thing is that all the keys

35
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,479
of the server depend  from the

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,610
main server key of

37
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,369
course it uses ssl behind thor and

38
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,020
the funny thing is that the

39
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,090
server keys are not on the server they are

40
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,740
calculated and every time the server

41
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,079
starts they are replaced so to speak

42
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,490
changed like

43
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,159
this you have practically other

44
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,960
servers that are connected  in the networks of

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,540
each e-mail that have part of some

46
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,700
functions when the mail server

47
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,470
starts with a password or with other

48
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,149
systems that the administrator decides they

49
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,369
go to negotiate functions on

50
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,229
other servers that it serves originals does not

51
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,360
know and then reconstructs the key and

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,560
then  these functions

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,899
basically die can be recreated

54
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,729
or destroyed through a

55
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,590
self-destruct certificate which is u  n type of

56
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,920
external certificate

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,930
for which substantially if the server

58
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,840
is stolen, seized tampered with,

59
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,819
the system administrator without having

60
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,230
access to the server can issue the

61
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,720
self-destruct certificate by

62
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,130
destroying the remote functions and thus

63
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,750
the server keys and typically making it

64
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,520
difficult to

65
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,100
read substantially because it does not

66
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,630
there are more keys

67
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,220
another thing that has been implemented in

68
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,770
every e-mail 2 is the certificate of self-

69
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,180
destruction of your

70
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,190
mailbox for example without

71
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,959
having access you can destroy your

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,730
mailbox because then you can determine

73
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,500
if your mailbox is also  mail to the

74
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,360
remote keys the only problem of the

75
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,830
remote keys and that obviously

76
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,510
there must be other servers is a whole series

77
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,549
of things for which if half the network falls

78
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:53,080
obviously with the

79
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,790
self-destruct certificate you have to create other

80
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,730
remote keys and so

81
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,970
on luckily we did not have

82
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,610
huge problems using this

83
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,230
system why not  n they have taken

84
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,330
down most of the servers yet and therefore

85
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,680
we have not had any problems of

86
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,739
this kind yet there are about 50 and

87
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,840
servers that are using onion

88
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,720
mail of which about ten server

89
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,400
servers that are public so

90
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,680
practically can be accessed through  an

91
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,090
eden service of thor there is a

92
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,370
website one registers after which he

93
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,930
uses any e

94
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,709
-mail program configuring to the server and

95
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,810
typically login and password like all

96
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,310
the only thing you have to do connected

97
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,940
via thor the funny thing is that

98
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,170
when  you do the registration of

99
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,090
course an address that your

100
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,280
name at 16 characters onion dot

101
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,959
and this is the address you have

102
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,730
inside the tor network

103
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,380
but those 16 characters are

104
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,239
bad enough to remember there is a protocol

105
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,900
for which it is negotiated are servers is

106
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,730
also managed a potable email address

107
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,250
so to speak that practically

108
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,250
the same login or with some

109
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,829
higher number if someone has it  used here a

110
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:05,440
little different at the exit node

111
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,850
in this way to a

112
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,859
transparent and usable address which is then

113
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:10,720
verified through everything is called

114
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,430
signatures through the various

115
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,410
simply serves the network the

116
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,560
funny thing is that this system allows you

117
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,000
to use practically any e-mail

118
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,130
as if it were a normal one with the only

119
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,570
difference that you have to connect them on thor

120
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,130
so it is no longer the problem of the 16

121
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,540
karat

122
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,250
ill.mo nyon which are quite

123
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,840
annoying and then quietly

124
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,480
communicate with people that on the internet

125
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,300
the inside of the server is done  in this

126
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,190
way here all the encryption is done

127
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,930
on different tree systems that

128
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,490
depend on the main key of

129
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,890
the remote key server and of

130
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,630
course on the users' passwords

131
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,410
and so on

132
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,290
every data on the server is saved based

133
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,040
on ash everything is reached via

134
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,530
the exits  so you once aimaro

135
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,960
server should recalculate all

136
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,580
ash backwards to redo all

137
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,850
steps each file  each message is

138
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,620
broken up into very small files that

139
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,510
are in turn critical various keys in

140
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,980
turn salted in turn

141
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,020
dependent on previous years with a

142
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,430
system that avoids collisions

143
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,730
even there is a situation that is

144
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,130
called a dark disk for which you have a

145
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,960
name  of file which is a

146
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,120
unique identifier that can also be made with

147
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,330
any byte is a consecutive number

148
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,190
that therefore the piece of to fail in the

149
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,500
inbox is even stolen with

150
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,020
this system and the block is encrypted with

151
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,090
an asymmetric key in this way the

152
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,160
server knows the  public key and can

153
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,840
add files when

154
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,910
new messages arrive but cannot read them

155
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,950
because he does not have that key the

156
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,360
key was there the user the key is the

157
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,090
password that somehow encodes the

158
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,190
private key to practically read

159
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,630
the mail messages  electronic

160
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,030
in this way if you seize servers they

161
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,190
can get only some

162
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,960
information such as which server and so on

163
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,830


164
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,160
ov  then everything is encrypted

165
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,130
unfortunately due to the connector it

166
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,380
stores the files in the information

167
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,030
still possible to obtain the

168
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,950
private key of the day service but from the

169
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,840
next versions we are working on

170
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,270
using the thor control port

171
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,040
that allows you to do leeden service

172
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,080
so to speak to  hot is a function that

173
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,090
basically allows you to connect to

174
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,460
thor in local building to highlight

175
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,470
visco this key and he knows it so

176
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,670
you no longer need to save any

177
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,010
file in this way the keys of the day

178
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,630
service are saved inside the

179
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,430
server on e mail and you do not know which

180
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,100
server you have taken in hand the fact

181
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,260
this is also working to move all

182
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,750
the specific configuration data of the

183
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,580
servers

184
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,930
inside the encrypted files dion e

185
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,699
mail and put all the servers in the same

186
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,680
directory that all  'appearance so to speak

187
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,449
of various numbered directories connect

188
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:42,949
various overloaded files of arbitrary length

189
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,240


190
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,530
then there is a system that changes the date

191
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,479
of the files u  n system that creates files and

192
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,430
destroys them at random is a system that

193
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,110
changes files a system that increases keys

194
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,740
and so on

195
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,990
this process is used to avoid

196
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,490
forensics being done inside the

197
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,750
content of the server obviously it is not a

198
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,069
perfect system  so it is not to be

199
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:02,629
considered the panacea and it is still an

200
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:03,919
experimental system so to speak

201
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,259
when then the 2d on hermes version was

202
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,610
complete we will have a system that will

203
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,219
finally be let's say the definitive one

204
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:11,569
but now even with the

205
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:13,729
let's say beta version

206
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:15,050
things are going a lot  good because for

207
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,180
example on the server I laugh because the server

208
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,550
that manages the club show we have like

209
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,979
20,000 users and I frankly think I

210
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:23,960
have 20,000 users I would never have

211
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,370
gotten to doing an experiment

212
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,349
the funny thing that other

213
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:29,479
servers also have like numbers like that

214
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:30,979
so a pretty thing  I will go

215
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:34,129
perfect then of course going to

216
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:37,879
see the sum of various servers so

217
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,370
we are more or less the then practice  nte

218
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,199
other two servers do the large

219
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,449
amount of users and the

220
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:47,440
funny thing that instead on other servers

221
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,550
we managed to find out through the

222
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,259
mailing list yes I know that there is a real

223
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:52,610
list of system administrators

224
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,099
who exchange information we

225
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,319
have run the request  to use

226
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,789
the statistics to know how many users

227
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:00,680
there are how much was used in short

228
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,029
if you know if it was worthwhile to continue

229
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:02,719
the project

230
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:04,879
given the numbers it became

231
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,800
interesting also because eighty

232
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,360
percent of users at best using

233
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,919
e-mail and then there are  interesting things

234
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,349
like you go to see the

235
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:13,940
pgp keys of those who have union

236
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,250
mele they have name and surname in real with

237
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,909
each to the doctor oh well give everything thor that

238
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:21,949
makes anonymous but in reality you go with

239
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:22,610
name and surname

240
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,110
well actually the spirit of each a

241
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,719
mail would be to use top

242
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:28,580
encryption etc. to ensure

243
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,259
constitutional rights actually

244
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,669
you could put the stran one as well  or even

245
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:33,320
come aside because by the

246
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,549
time you have an e-

247
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,140
mail address you are no longer anonymous 6

248
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,230
that e-mail address

249
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,110
anyway the funny thing is that these

250
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,549
things here should

251
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,950
somehow make it more difficult to capture

252
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,660
the metadata from  part of our application

253
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,280
however there is a whole system torro

254
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,260
breaks the bales enough on this you

255
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,640
have to be very motivated to go to

256
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,590
tread the one after which the servers are

257
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,120
clicked on them so it increases

258
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,280
greater security and then we

259
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,720
always tell the users that it is  mandatory

260
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,830
would be pd

261
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,360
in this way you have practically

262
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,920
chopped lemay so even if they were to

263
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,350
crack the server rack arts the

264
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,480
mailbox with 10 thousand things then

265
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,690
in the end there is typical and thor and here you have to

266
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,310
create a lot of things let's say that you are

267
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,800
all  inside an email to matryoshka that

268
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,360
can give you a little more security

269
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,060
so to speak then in principle there are a

270
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,180
lot of functions some

271
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,710
pos addresses  The electronic mail of an e-mail are

272
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,290
divided by type so fourth is

273
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,910
an e-mail address give

274
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,070
e mail knows exactly what any name

275
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,140
is is a new one of a user those

276
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,850
that end up lists are mail in the

277
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,530
list because each mail supports  the

278
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,240
mailing lists those that are

279
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,820
onion are the old systems that

280
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,560
were used when there was not yet the

281
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,660
possibility of registering the name at the

282
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,670
exit nodes the possibility of

283
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,080
using the new user point

284
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,820
the address of 16 characters strut or at

285
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,440
north exit when not

286
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,790
protocol still existed we

287
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,990
still talk about old stuff

288
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,780
but it can still be done then there is another

289
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,660
type of message that are the point ap

290
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,270
the point apple are basically the

291
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,190
bots that know they are used to make auto

292
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,440
responders services and things like that

293
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,930
after which there is  is a snail server which is

294
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,460
just a hit inside the server

295
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,290
where the user can send mail

296
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,780
servers and make requests everything

297
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,430
that  you can save you can

298
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,140
also do encrypted with pgp because it server

299
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,510
to its keys and then there is yes I know why

300
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,250
the system administrator you can

301
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,750
check the system administrator

302
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,480
can identify the server and especially

303
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,950
if you do not have [ __ ] to put the  16

304
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,960
characters point ronin you can put the am

305
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,420
point onion which for the system

306
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,800
now means myself that is to say the

307
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,810
same server substantially therefore

308
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,430
there are also very

309
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,110
easy addresses with which users can

310
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,910
contact the system administrator if

311
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,160
something happens or to the server  if they want to

312
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,480
do something like for example there is

313
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,830
someone who breaks the bales for

314
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,880
spam

315
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,590
you put him in the anti spam list and the

316
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,330
server from that moment on that address

317
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,680
there can no longer communicate with

318
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,839
because there is an anti spam list there  what

319
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,399
can be done at the user level

320
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,510
what can be done at the server level

321
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,230


322
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,610
you can also define I want to exit

323
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,100
from the other node I want to use this

324
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,200
address that o on in  ternet or use

325
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,550
this other address that I bone of the

326
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,010
internet on 9 output or I want to

327
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,350
destroy the name that or on the internet

328
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,089
create another you can do it

329
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:11,440
safely are all the functions

330
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,600
you can do through the server including

331
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,130
you can ask for the guide and it will

332
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,870
return you  back all the guide you can

333
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,580
ask for the identification of the server

334
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,230
I see it says all figer pente

335
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,600
certified etcetera etcetera signed

336
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,160
with its public key gpg and all

337
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,300
the rest

338
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,950
or you can do many other things then of

339
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,240
course the

340
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,560
sysadmins also have further things

341
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,320
to do the  log substantially

342
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,970
are not identifying for the user

343
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,279
because at the level of every 10 minutes

344
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,320
some coins are changed such as

345
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,149
everything concerning each subject

346
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:42,430
is changed as usher fifth is the

347
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,550
subject n 0 0 1 n002 after two minutes

348
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,589
another thing has changed  that you can

349
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,420
set serial mail to change the

350
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,970
clock each e mail change then

351
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,190
in the sense that it does not have the same time

352
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,779
system to avoid knowing the

353
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,279
time zone where the server is located

354
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,380
we can establish that every certain time they

355
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,360
change forward by a minute or two

356
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,400
minutes if you exaggerate you risk making

357
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,839
delusions so it is better to leave it as

358
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:05,260
default

359
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,209
so basically you could

360
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:08,770
receive a message  and maybe that it is

361
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,180
a few minutes early and a few minutes late with

362
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,529
respect to the bull

363
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,240
because everyone mails what it does

364
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,029
then of the server and changes it so

365
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:17,709
that you cannot know the time zone and

366
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:18,459
so on

367
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:20,080
another thing it does  analyze

368
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,330
the message header removes all

369
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,070
the classic headers re you see the

370
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,480
rest that let you know where the message comes from

371
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,209
or type user agent for example

372
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:30,040
or something like that

373
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,959
in some cases in pgp messages

374
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,029
also remove version because in some cases there is

375
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,500
for  example version if you have the

376
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,970
version that that specifies that

377
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,589
etcetera he changes with another

378
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:40,570
version substantially so you

379
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,829
can't even know that  cabbage

380
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,839
operating system ai and on which

381
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,370
operating system pcp is using on some

382
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,290
versions it is possible to know the

383
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,550
operating system the architecture everything else

384
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,649
via persia then this is

385
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:52,750
substantially changed things that

386
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,730
can be activated deactivated on the

387
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,970
user profile always asking the server

388
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,069
the funny thing  is that it has a whole

389
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,779
system of federated servers that

390
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,759
occur among themselves part with a

391
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,350
list of servers that are trusted then

392
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,329
through a protocol they verify the

393
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,250
ssl keys between them and verify

394
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,240
each other

395
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,949
then there is a parallel system

396
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:12,720
called network noise  basically if

397
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,430
a server fails if something happens that

398
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,360
shouldn't happen

399
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,189
there is practically a list in which

400
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:18,480
all the information

401
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,399
concerning the fake arrives for example

402
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,629
when there was the attack on the store a

403
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:23,819
few years ago I don't tell you the

404
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:25,259
casino it is  happened on that list

405
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:27,569
we said ok happened the world or the

406
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:29,639
system that works happened next  they and

407
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,720
absurd stuff

408
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,100
the fact you can know a lot

409
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,660
of things when they fall leader service

410
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,740
when they are reachable

411
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,990
when they are not reachable which noda

412
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,519
and a half that is breaking the bales

413
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,209
etc.

414
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,500
in fact on version 2 we have

415
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,850
implemented classes that are going

416
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,379
to deal with the

417
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:45,600
thor management to see this then he manages to

418
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,550
know I could not reach

419
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,949
the server because in version 1 ok

420
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:51,360
I could not the idea service did not

421
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,149
work I do not know in version 2 it

422
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,800
tells you ok leeden service and game or

423
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,750
service lines not  it is reachable because

424
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,310
such and such knot thor has broken the bales

425
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,379
to tell you so he changes the circuit and

426
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:03,389
tries again and all stories of the kind that

427
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:04,649
we are are still in the process of

428
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:07,589
processing various mario stories in short, it

429
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:10,470
is a pretty nice gadget that

430
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,199
should be more or less simple  to

431
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,600
use for users some servers i have

432
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,160
even seen they used

433
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,180
captchas

434
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,680
and they are quite groups  which were

435
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
still the first version because the

436
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,709
first version is completely textual so

437
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,720
there is text hunting and some

438
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,040
are still using it others have

439
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,689
disabled others have the images

440
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:29,550
have tell me when in three plus two to

441
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,240
tell you and then you have passed these things

442
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,920
should be able  be usable with

443
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,899
thunder uil told the bird in just

444
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,069
turbidi will reactivate the

445
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:39,930
thunderbid autoconfiguration because it

446
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:40,889
seems they have temporarily disabled it

447
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:42,149
because there was some

448
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,139
security value

449
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,029
practically it also

450
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:46,410
supports autoconfiguration so

451
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,000
once you give it the login and password you are

452
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,439
you on thor he does the autoconfiguration

453
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:51,809
with contending him on the net the answer already

454
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,670
all right

455
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,800
klose is the best program to use

456
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,660
also because with chrome and you know log so

457
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,189
if with connection torch that

458
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,689
maybe unstable you see what

459
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:02,430
happened thunderbird is a bit  one year it

460
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,860
will be his problem

461
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,569
and so okay his android can

462
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:09,310
be used with k 9 never  le orbo

463
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,810
quietly or any other

464
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,220
e-mail program would like to

465
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,930
use the important thing is to

466
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,550
always use the encryption of the e-

467
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,170
mail because yes there is an e-mail

468
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,079
behind but not counted they are e-mail

469
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,189
contacts on the same because the

470
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:22,660
final actor is always the one who does  the

471
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,269
most important game actually what

472
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:27,069
else can you say the project is still

473
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:30,129
under development and there are interesting stuff

474
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,649
also regarding a bit of statistics

475
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:35,290
on the various servers for example this they

476
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,579
didn't want to give me the numbers but

477
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:38,230
they only gave me the  things are

478
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,329
the trend of the use of the server

479
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:41,589
day by day

480
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:44,379
these are practically the bandwidth of

481
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:47,079
use of the various servers and here there is

482
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,740
practically a large use of non-

483
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,389
mail and foo the one that is

484
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:56,649
used the most and therefore there are several  there

485
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:58,269
are so many that we have been

486
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:00,819
set up by various volunteers and of

487
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:03,550
course too soon on a computer on the

488
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,319
server then also put two or three

489
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:07,180
servers but it is better  I don't do it

490
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,009
another piece of advice that opens an

491
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,110
exit node you have to know what you are doing

492
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,639
because how to have a double thor exit

493
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,209
and above all and above all do not put

494
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,550
users in it, that is, exit sound is a sort

495
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,009
of router where messages come in and out and

496
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,860
you do nothing else  objectively other

497
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,420
information can be found on an e-mail

498
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,389
info point is a bit ugly he was

499
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:30,250
fine sooner or later fair they wanted

500
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,379
time to fix that too the

501
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,029
funny thing is that it is a project that is

502
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,439
going very fast I can not

503
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,480
keep up with it always but anyway every

504
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,589
so much I saw that there are

505
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:40,829
collaborators something you can do

506
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:43,209
other related projects that there

507
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:45,490
were nt human more than it was a project

508
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,379
that basically took the ben

509
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,089
service and the real one directed towards

510
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:51,490
another in service was used

511
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,309
at the beginning in the  early versions of years

512
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:56,110
and mail to hide exit nodes in

513
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,819
the end we avoided doing it

514
00:16:57,819 --> 00:16:59,110
basically because being

515
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,540
routers  useless to put a gadget

516
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,459
that acts as a router at the tcp level to

517
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:04,449
get a gadget that makes you go

518
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,490
beyond the smtp level put the final one

519
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,799
you have solved the problem so much that

520
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,270
once they find that they have

521
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,699
nothing they have no users have yes shop

522
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,490
okay  thanks another thing that you are

523
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,569
basically doing

524
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,720
the use of the help text files

525
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,849
there is a command called roulette

526
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:26,040
this sends the word

527
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,079
roulette on the subject to the server and it returns you

528
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,790
to the help file with all the

529
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,500
explanations on what it is  'it is a doctor

530
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,660
had used all the functions

531
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,800
the funny thing is that

532
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,570
the system administrator can

533
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,490
determine how many files places of this

534
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,990
type and users can register

535
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,310
this type of file the

536
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,350
one on which it is registered by default

537
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:48,240
type the message of the  the day that is

538
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,420
basically when

539
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,050
you log in

540
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,510
you can receive the message not when

541
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,040
you are not logged in so as to avoid that

542
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,380
you fill up the box with p

543
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,850
so that basically you have

544
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,980
information like tomorrow there will be

545
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,130
maintenance the server so and so from

546
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,410
day to day it may not work

547
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,900
or various stories in short, tomorrow it

548
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,940
will happen we update so it

549
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,070
may not work from to

550
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,900
another interesting thing is that this

551
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,120
system  use to connect as

552
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,880
user pop3 and you will say pop3 because not

553
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,490
imap and there is a very specific choice pop3 has

554
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,990
been chosen first of all because

555
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,760
because the user connects it saves

556
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,380
messages on his system he leaves

557
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,370
nothing on the server

558
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,110
so you need to stay clean  it is

559
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,820
basically once you

560
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,650
seize servers it is possible that there is

561
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,160
as little data as possible that they can

562
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,630
say they have information about users

563
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,490
the other thing is basically that

564
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,660
using pop3 is also easier to

565
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,390
implement of course but the

566
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,330
funny thing is that even if you read

567
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,070
the message  è do not delete at the end

568
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,750
of the section those you have

569
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,270
downloaded he deletes them c  on white

570
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,640
deletes them with trouble for they were small pieces

571
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,120
of fi

572
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,280
also changes the index so hello there

573
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,230
is nothing more

574
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,960
temporary files are encrypted and the funny thing is

575
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,090
that every ormail always works like

576
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,890
onion and that's why they are called

577
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,660
e  mail is there when I send a message

578
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,000
from the sender to the recipient the sender's

579
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,920
server cota to the recipient's server

580
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,250
there are no intermediate steps

581
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,050
the message is transferred in

582
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,910
real time if something goes wrong but an

583
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,530
error arrives on the mail client there is not  that

584
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,090
you save the message there and after they send them it

585
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,160
does real time try not to

586
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,320
use the disk because it can try not to

587
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,790
use the ram pickup or so as not to

588
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,110
leave a trace

589
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,490
the only one you save to the message is

590
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,890
square from the server of  exit send

591
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,800
the message out because maybe there may be

592
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,570
one of those servers on the other side that

593
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,720
there is the little speech that does not immediately receive

594
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,640
the white message and wants the

595
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,230
message to be sent back after ten

596
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,210
minutes to see if a  gadget that makes

597
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,230
spam

598
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,640
about spam onion mail a

599
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,650
lot of spam filters that can

600
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,840
be activated or deactivated use

601
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,760
the spam dns lists

602
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,920
uses various things that can be

603
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,110
activated by saying

604
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,790
and if you want you can also activate something

605
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,410
like this when a

606
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,750
message arrives and  mail from and smtp you the

607
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,600
server what to do away from stp smtp

608
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,150
on the contrary on the sender if the sender does not exist

609
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,950
closes the connection just

610
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,640
6 spam

611
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,840
you can also activate things of this

612
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,390
kind however in terms of

613
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,640
network use and rather expensive here usually

614
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,920
me and  thick is not activated and can

615
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,920
only be activated single output other

616
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,260
funny things that there are about this

617
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,440
gizmo which just loves

618
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,750
support principles that supports keys

619
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,120
up to 16,000 384 bits

620
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,190
so actually if you are paranoid

621
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,900
you want to communicate with server I want to

622
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,850
create a mailing  list and the list of

623
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,980
users are these and you can send it in

624
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,870
pgp and he creates the manley for you states he creates

625
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,150
the mailing lists p  to something precisely

626
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,820
list at sign is the name of the server in

627
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,310
which it can also include users of

628
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,900
the internet but the list apples do not

629
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,850
support the crazy protocol of which you

630
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,530
are a user of the mail list

631
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,050
on the internet will have to do list point to

632
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,390
liszt point 16 characters  point nyon

633
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,710
so okay you do what you can

634
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,230
honestly there is not a great use of

635
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,610
apples in lists other than that of ssis or

636
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,920
for another thirty melilli the

637
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,320
funny thing that you can know you could

638
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,780
know are mail up to  1 to 180 the

639
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,280
number of users the number of sails in

640
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,380
lists but from the next version it

641
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,240
is no longer possible to know why there is a

642
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,850
contraption called fu rami de is

643
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,860
a contraption that runs together with onna e

644
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,080
mail substantially a thread that every

645
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,400
time  something is blocked

646
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,470
dislocated something breaks the boxes a bit

647
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,740
ago creates fake messages that you have

648
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,080
gp fake messages where p and q are not

649
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,910
prime and therefore you cannot decree it

650
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,049
because it does not exist or other things and does

651
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:46,640
some simulations of stupid things like

652
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,010
the password and stuff like that then go to

653
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,260
see the ram of the gadget you find

654
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,880
sensitive data and maybe you are finding

655
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,799
pure mid and you find asymmetric keys

656
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,780
maybe you are finding framid

657
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,940
and you find 9 but maybe all crap

658
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,250
and then  create files rename files

659
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,090
etcetera etcetera

660
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,270
on the next version of the project is

661
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,039
the idea was to create a system

662
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,100
that interfaced between the activation

663
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,320
through a remote server the

664
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,419
real remote key server and

665
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:15,890
even interaction with the hardware

666
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,470
by doing  several cycles so that if

667
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,789
the hardware can be seen on the tarot

668
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:22,669
sin noticing ever you put the

669
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:23,990
different passphrase that you are in

670
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,820
order not to activate the server but

671
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,980
that other or the same thing you have done

672
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,309
on a function on the remote servers the

673
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,049
server could  be the one that

674
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:34,700
activates right or activates a server

675
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,190
let's say clean or with other things or stuff

676
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,059


677
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,830
so you can basically hide

678
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,419
a server  inside another do some sort

679
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:43,850
of shorthand inside the system

680
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,580
to make it a little bit more secure

681
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,110
the other thing you are working on is the

682
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,880
backup server the backup

683
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,190
servers follows original server goes down would be

684
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,559
original part backup server with

685
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,900
des services sorry in which server tour

686
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,690
you would have thought of hijacking are you

687
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,460
sure you have hijacked that server

688
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,200
but if the idea service still works and

689
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,490
you don't have the keys to this thing in

690
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,039
hand and these are the little things

691
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,110
that are being worked on for the  moment is

692
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,039
all

693
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,620
and this is basically the progress

694
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,090
of the project we have about 25,000 30,000

695
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,650
users who are using this

696
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,510
stuff here according to the statistics that

697
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,490
have been provided to us, eighty percent

698
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,799
of users on average use it every

699
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,200
day begin to see

700
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,760
facebook profiles that  not e mail year every email

701
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,660
point info or mx3 etcetera etc

702
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,790
the funny thing is that if you look at the

703
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,140
output logs

704
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,270
now they are encrypted in rsa  to tell you

705
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,680
about the new version so

706
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,240
basically it is no longer even the

707
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,280
right to see the logs in the new

708
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,810
version the logs are broken up into

709
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,850
little ones that are overwritten where

710
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,380
practically every file and a single

711
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,870
line of logs that are randomly placed so

712
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,410
bye is a bit  burdensome in some ways

713
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,480
but in reality they do not mail server

714
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,540
that smells so many stuff is not so

715
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,890
heavy to make it

716
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,810
work unless you do not want to

717
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,940
do it on purpose by setting the

718
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,130
framid module and that the one that produces [ __ ] to the

719
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,290
maximum and this  Libyans hear use me 90

720
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,940
percent of the range in [ __ ] and

721
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,720
write

722
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,810
like 30 files per minute and then sailing

723
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,520
becomes then but oh well you are

724
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,590
hurt you and then where is it if you wanted to

725
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,510
do it with the six for paranoid and then

726
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,130
always a computer  it will become a

727
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,620
sieve it's your business in short the

728
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,060
funny thing is that in any case the problem

729
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,310
is a bit with the graphic in has so a bit

730
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,920
ajax a bit that or that but

731
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,290
in short it was done more than halt  ro to

732
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,530
bring the average user closer to

733
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,430
cryptographic systems nice enough even

734
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,040
for people we say are not too

735
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,440
experienced so I think it has had a

736
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,600
good success among non-expert people

737
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,129
in short o and that's

738
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,520
all action 2 when you think it's

739
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,650
version 2  I think it will be operational and

740
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,110
next year in beta because

741
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,150
there is already a version 2 that is running

742
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,670
but practically remember it has been re-

743
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,440
engineered from scratch and also many

744
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,970
other things have been done practically

745
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,710
from scratch while maintaining compatibility with

746
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,890
the existing songs if it wouldn't be a

747
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,230
bloodbath of course the

748
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:33,940
funny thing is that to make servers 2

749
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,160
you have to create a series of fictitious servers

750
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,200
a parallel network that communicates with each

751
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,570
other make us trams c attack it to

752
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,060
see if it reads after it has been passed

753
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,490
at the call al colabrodo he says ok we have a

754
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,650
beta version also because we are

755
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,480
this water project has been going on for about

756
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,820
two years sorry there is an anthracite gray clio

757
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,790
from sp  host that he parked

758
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,920
in one way I move it I arrived

759
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,550
almost immediately it lacks for that

760
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,560
if there is a w on the plate and my

761
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,760


762
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,700
rest assured ok for take away immediately from even a very

763
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,160
fast question using it

764
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,200
combined with another email then to

765
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,940
send email  and also receive

766
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,700
the internet with and then you lose look at

767
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,230
the sending of the e-mail message

768
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,410
is about

769
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,070
fifteen seconds

770
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,560
the funny thing is that when you are

771
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,260
on the client seen that the mail in

772
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,080
real time July is away from the tractor  bull

773
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,790
about fifteen seconds depending more

774
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,930
or less on the length of the

775
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,000
then oh well if you find server tori

776
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,370
stuck it will take even more

777
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,130
15 30 seconds is the message index

778
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,800
basically the beta or better that you

779
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,650
can and thor that communicates through between voice

780
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,770
you do what you can, however, for

781
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,570
the e-mail it is acceptable for

782
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,490
that tour, maybe you just need to set the

783
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,350
longer time out but this

784
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,470
also makes you like the second one  or you clip

785
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,220
any e-mail program

786
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,860
at the longest time out because the network is

787
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,979
the

788
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,890
right one you remembered times they

789
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,870
changed they replaced klaus miley it

790
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:14,010
seems with goose ice yes yes yes yes little girls

791
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,780
much better much better surely

792
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,010
because at least we are

793
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,690
going to  thunderbird autoconfiguration and

794
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,070
we are no longer jogging to use an

795
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,080
absurd wizard but the user can easily

796
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,360
do with thunderbird and who cares

797
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,700
basically it actually became

798
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,630
even better because practically

799
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,790
the wizard project was a hyper experimental thing it

800
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,110
is absolutely a

801
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,770
bun and the funny thing that much

802
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,540
he tags much better one

803
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,550
less problem to manage and basically

804
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,970
we made a more direct registration in

805
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,770
fact there is web page

806
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,140
etc. etc. of course there are some

807
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,330
things to fix again for example on

808
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,800
web registration because for example the

809
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,240
best thing to do to register

810
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,090
sounds  e mail today is to have an e-mail with

811
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,570
principles to send a message to yourself  rver

812
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,460
onion mail

813
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,630
the wing 16 characters dot nyon with user

814
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:09,570
the username practically on the

815
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,360
message modes as the message body a

816
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,880
pgp key send and use to the

817
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,530
small pg encrypted message your

818
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,350
user account information without

819
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,000
even having to go through the web

820
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,370
having everything perfectly encrypted

821
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,320
this is the best solution that the

822
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,179
first version of the inscription the one

823
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,130
on the web and for the hummer who are not

824
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,700
able to tell you also why then now

825
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,740
we will have to see what

826
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,490
the websites want to establish for ssl rescue

827
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,440
why epic fail put ssl  because then the

828
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,480
certificate is not valid but with the

829
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,590
new version it will be able to have a

830
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,330
certificate that will be the same

831
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,920
as the thor key so we will have to see

832
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,620
what they will establish as tor the auser the

833
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,280
best thing is to do it via pcp

834
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,990
questions well let's

835
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,820
raise the curtains exposed to the machine
