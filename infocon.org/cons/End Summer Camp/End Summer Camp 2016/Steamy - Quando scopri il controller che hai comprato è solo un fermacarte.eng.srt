1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,540
ok welcome now we will have a talk esteem

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,460
when you discover the controller you

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,639
bought is just a paperweight and it is with

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,110
great pleasure that I want to introduce

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,360
this speaker because he sent me a

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,910
very nice fantastic bio she

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,519
honks to head

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,010
I want a hole yo the comma old

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,810
as if it were 0

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,840
I want premature comma mascetti as

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,290
if it were 72 etc. etc. continue

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,890
you can very well imagine how but it

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,050
is not a supercazzola chance because this

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,260
text is a

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,190
monicelli program and it is a l word il monicelli and

16
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,460
this in my opinion says a lot about the

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,739
presenter who  so we have

18
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,719
our applause an applause to our

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:05,090
me who will talk to me now please

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,440
ok

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,250
good morning we are about to embark on

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,560
an adventure in the world of

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,600
usb device reversing

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,810
first of all those who have no idea what it is

25
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,960
I esteem

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,850
ok estimate a

27
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,950
video game distribution platform one  of the

28
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,979
most enormous and lately they have also

29
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:50,520
started to produce steam machines that

30
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,750
use linux and their plan e  ra putting

31
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,110
a sti machine in every room with a

32
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,500
sofa the problem was that most

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,300
of the games on steam are for computers

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,400
are made for computers

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,590
so we needed a controller that would

36
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,959
also work with video games

37
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,440
designed for keyboards and mice which resulted in

38
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,650
loft in controller that this

39
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,970
gizmo here is a little different from let's say

40
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,950
the standard controllers it was released

41
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,040
in November 2015 they have already sold

42
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,840
half a million pieces which are not

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,530
very few it was designed for the ati

44
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,019
machine designed for

45
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:45,019
keyboard and mouse games as well as by  and controller

46
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,310
otherwise that also an interesting design

47
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,989
for use for media centers and control

48
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,459
various things that could be

49
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,680
controlled as by arduino raspberry or

50
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,240
what as input to two touchpads

51
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,630
an analog stick the classic ab

52
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,310
xy buttons a nom button select and start the

53
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:15,270
bumpers these  the triggers and something a little

54
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,750
different

55
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,010
cheerful are not very common as keys

56
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,920
no that is a gyroscope an accelerometer

57
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,850
that make the thing i  Interesting

58
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,710
especially for media centers to do

59
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,760
antani directional things unfortunately

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,590
once I got home I

61
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,530
realized that it is a paperweight because it is

62
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,380
the only way to be used and

63
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,460
start steam open on the machine which

64
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,970
is practically impossible on raspberry

65
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,730
for example  because it weighs but figure is

66
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,690
the only way to configure it and using

67
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,670
estimate b chart mode which has been designed

68
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,390
to be used from a sofa and

69
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,400
therefore with a controller but if you want to

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,390
use the controller from a computer you will

71
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,280
find an interface with giant buttons

72
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,240
in  face and it is a way of configuring it

73
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,760
that is quite nonsense and returning to

74
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,010
the paperweight discourse what

75
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,920
they call lizard mode or when you

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,870
attach the controller to a computer

77
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,440
without a team it makes it behave that a

78
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,450
strange mixture between the keyboard and a

79
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:30,810
mouse

80
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,790
so it is perfectly useless as

81
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:41,610
controller now having bought it

82
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,680
having spent some money wanting to use

83
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,300
a I would have had to find a solution

84
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,580
already  made that it allowed me to

85
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,050
use it or just do it myself the first

86
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,780
thing I found was a

87
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,030
project written in python in

88
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,650
very horrible code it only works on linux and

89
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,390
after spending a couple of hours and

90
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,220
trying to understand what he was doing

91
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,229
to read  controller I

92
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,670
realized it was completely wrong

93
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,400
so let's press the buttons antani told

94
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,720
you there is no configuration file

95
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,060


96
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,130
but an ep ai to write the daemon

97
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,760
map to whatever you want but justin has

98
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,670
a configuration file of his which is

99
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,130
saved when  the configured of the big

100
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,210
fish mode and there is a whole community with

101
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,470
katie from the configuration files already

102
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,930
made so not being able to read a

103
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,270
configuration file to the team becomes

104
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,710
double the work because you also have to

105
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,880
risk having fun with the muffins you

106
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,640
need not that it is

107
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,090
the second one has been practically abandoned this one is

108
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,880
very cool instead it is written in ge

109
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,780
reversing is slightly less complete than

110
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,450
what I did and it works s  only

111
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,050
on linux

112
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,660
the writers daemon more always only on

113
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,100
linux it is wrong for the

114
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,530
gyroscope the accelerometer which

115
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,850
made me waste a lot of time to

116
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,580
get it right there too the

117
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,870
configuration files incompatible with that

118
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,340
of steam which makes it useless and

119
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,780
still a bit irritating the fact that it was

120
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,810
nowhere to be found in search engines

121
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,570
looking for steam control on google it

122
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,370
was precisely that in python a

123
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,310
stuff like three lines of north ds that

124
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,660
did nothing

125
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,200
I come the same and then after a month that

126
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,490
I started working I  found this

127
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,860
that was practically already done so by

128
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,590
now I had wasted my time so what

129
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,190
can you still do to make a tree it

130
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,010
takes a sniffer because you have to read

131
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,830
what goes between the controller and

132
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,910
your computer

133
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,590
I what I did not know that wired that you

134
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,780
can  use as a sniffer using usb

135
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,760
world which is a lot of stuff

136
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,610
and we also need something that makes us

137
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,380
readable the protocol that passes

138
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,680
over usb we could have used  are wired

139
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,040
but it became a bit complex then seeing

140
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
what I was doing compared to the

141
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,110
program I was writing and

142
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,220
obviously a lot of time to waste

143
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,970
served because now moving on to the

144
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:36,030
implementation part if I find the terminal

145
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,100
then

146
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,600
so

147
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:59,479
where are you now for a moment

148
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,710
you would see the open apple

149
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,919
go  well right

150
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:49,850
using wireshark and attaching team

151
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,139
to the controller

152
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,749
the first thing you notice is that it starts

153
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:57,670
reading 64 gbyte packets

154
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,350
which already tells us something that will be there

155
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,970
is very true how much is the basic size

156
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,359
of the packet

157
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:33,839
about how do you

158
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,439
do it  i can do it i know

159
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,700
because in the other door he comes to tell you

160
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:35,140
there was an escapement i know we

161
00:10:35,140 --> 00:11:04,199
can do this too

162
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:17,060
ah i understand what it is ok i made it

163
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:24,940
found alone i found that the bass that

164
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,690
both ports are on  same

165
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,890
low

166
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:33,170
ok now as you can see this is the

167
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,450
packet that arrives from the

168
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:43,250
controller every second which explains us

169
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,410
that this must be the state of the

170
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,250
controller so inside there is  everything

171
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,820
that is holding down in the controller

172
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,320
now damn I would need the ather or

173
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,930
inter

174
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:14,839
I do this but you can see that there is a

175
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,260
number that grows and

176
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,670
if you notice now there are two bytes

177
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,820
so we can already understand that this is at

178
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,680
least

179
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,390
a short in  little indian if you

180
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,330
waste another 30 minutes, you will

181
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,780
find that it reaches the end

182
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,410
so it is an int

183
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,200
little indian another thing you can

184
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:58,510
notice is that that number is

185
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,670
also present when you press a

186
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,000
button which is important that is there  indicates that it

187
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,790
is a sequence number of the package sequence

188
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,870
that is coming to

189
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:22,600
us I can do it thanks also thanks to the first

190
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,090
button but very nice if you notice now

191
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,880
pressing a number of buttons you see that

192
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,290
the only field that starts to change

193
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,080
this here and pressing them all

194
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,020
transforming the decimal injured into binary

195
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,300
you immediately notice that it is ab so

196
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,910
we have a map that shows us which

197
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,920
button is pressed if you like the

198
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,520
most there will be the various bits marked for

199
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,900
each bot  tone then simply a

200
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,550
matter of putting yourself there pressing

201
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,890
every button try to understand if there

202
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,870
are clowns who actually press

203
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,760
more things for example by touching by touching the

204
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,430
touchpad and a large number arrives

205
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,140
there that is absolutely not a beat only

206
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,120
this means that there are more

207
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,430
related events  to the touchpad

208
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,910
then

209
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,870
this is the final b but after

210
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,400
losing a top you can see that the pad

211
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,310
ah yes to the touch that the click that the various

212
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,070
directions

213
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,130
there is also the stick the stick touch which

214
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,660
does not make much sense but unfortunately there is

215
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,490
a trackpad  which does not have the

216
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,760
directional buttons instead this is the pad

217
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,420
this track and the other buttons that

218
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,740
were quite easy

219
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,470
now doing something a moment more

220
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,860
complex or by touching the pads we can

221
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,380
realize that there is a column that

222
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,990
changes very intensely

223
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,340
so we can understand that that  we are

224
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,410
interested in the position of

225
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,690
the finger on the trackpad and we can

226
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,910
also know that they are necessarily

227
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,380
two numbers since it is an as  if xy and

228
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,340
we also know that they are signac because the

229
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,670
center is zero go up is more go down and

230
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:11,110
less then we have already found where

231
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,330
that is the trap has the other same speech from the left

232
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,930


233
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,030
the triggers these back here are really

234
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,420
interesting because in addition to  giving

235
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,880
the state of pressure presses

236
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,440
also gives a partial of how much the button

237
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,050
is being pressed

238
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,270
what is even more interesting is the fact

239
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,380
that there is another 16 bit field

240
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,320
instead of 8 which in theory tells us the

241
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,880
same thing but with more precision

242
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,730
now if you connected wirelessly the

243
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,880
controller that movie would not be

244
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,680
there I don't understand why it doesn't make great sense

245
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,550
how to sign them controllers no

246
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,650
actually the opposite when wireless

247
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,099
shoots you instead you almost notice when you try

248
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,310
a button it's an input only when

249
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,780
you let go of it  another comes with wireless

250
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,329
and shoots b thousand thousand at the same time

251
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,129
so it's just stupid

252
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,450
once you find the buttons it

253
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,310
is all the rest

254
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,730
the only thing missing is the  gyroscope

255
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,050
and accelerometer and these are a bit more

256
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,010
badass

257
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:55,010
because now you will see for this is

258
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,360
the only thing you can do is find

259
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,750
out something very useful

260
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,670
look remember how much stuff there is

261
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:11,260
ok chemistry sky

262
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,620
behind magic a lot of stuff  now at 0

263
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,230
which helps us greatly is another

264
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:37,030
for strange things seen controller now

265
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:42,190
we know that the gyroscope tells us the

266
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,040
position in three dimensions and therefore we

267
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,770
need three axes instead of two so

268
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,140
we are looking for 24 bits

269
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,150
we also know that if the control

270
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,300
stands still the gyro should stay

271
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,629
still

272
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:06,910
so we can see that this is more

273
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:15,910
or less stationary and if we lift things

274
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:21,070
up they specifically go up this if you turn

275
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,320
like this and it's just a matter of wasting a

276
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,740
lot of time trying to understand each

277
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:33,850
axis which is not easy because  clearly

278
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:39,570
gyroscope fluctuates and being sin and

279
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,430
ebay numerini it is not that they go in the area

280
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:47,610
around 0 1 2 they go from 0 to ff

281
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,680
because clearly this is how the

282
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,430
numbers marked the accelerator work  ometro same

283
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,690
speech

284
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,040
only that it is much more difficult to

285
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,840
verify because you still have to start

286
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,170
a jerk to do is to understand which of the

287
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:06,450
assists you are running very strongly

288
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,340
now one of the tools I wrote to

289
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,100
help me in this adventure is a

290
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,830
rast library that does things  very

291
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,159
nice

292
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:29,080
but this this the the colors are

293
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,360
made to help you understand what the

294
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,620
hell is going on this is the

295
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,559
sequence this is the range of the

296
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,940
state of the buttons these are the triggers

297
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,230
this is the pad that and the other is here

298
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,309
we have the  gyroscope the

299
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:53,740
blondest accelerometer of su tool is that

300
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:59,200
this is the typical husky table

301
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,769
they use in rfc and produces it

302
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:03,659
automatically

303
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:06,870
now targeted with cable tv that if not

304
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,289
you understand a tube

305
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,850
yes maybe if you disability that the sensors

306
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,790
the water is easier to understand what is

307
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,600
happening

308
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,520
already transforms you into a big but pre in

309
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,620
binary to understand which buttons do

310
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,960
what that is the division already in

311
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,950
conversion from binary what to its

312
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,640
n  cute humor and many other blonde things

313
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,860
that still allow you to do

314
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,180
an incremental protocol analysis

315
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,460
because you find out something you have the idea

316
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,020
a nice color the freight from how many big ii

317
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,690
from the type and you find your beautiful

318
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,800
flying vision of what  it is

319
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:22,039
the code a bit awful but you should

320
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:26,779
understand that the input defines a

321
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,169
field to give a name and it is a type

322
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:32,419
nyland ianes and it is a style and so

323
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:35,989
on simply go over the

324
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:37,820
buffer you got there it makes your print

325
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:46,279
fly one more thing  interesting seen

326
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:50,139
controller is the fact that the two touchpads have

327
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:53,869
what is called high

328
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:56,749
definition feedback which is a lamp

329
00:22:56,749 --> 00:22:59,719
that doesn't mean [ __ ] but the point

330
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:03,009
is that instead of being normal vibrators

331
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:05,779
that we all use during the

332
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:11,779
night they are like things that rotate  like there

333
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:14,779
was a pirlo and they turn like this and then give them

334
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:17,959
the distance is the path they do

335
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:22,129
which produces a tactile feedback you can

336
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:26,259
do the doodles wanting another

337
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:34,309
very nice thing is the following s  and I can I

338
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:36,049
have to do something to turn this on it is

339
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:40,489
not enough to turn it on just how it goes from

340
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:46,639
that let's see if I can turn it on it makes

341
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:49,700
a little music ok this thing has no

342
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:55,429
speakers which advises us that we

343
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:59,049
can do very old things

344
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:03,909
or

345
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:08,330
we can transform it for example one

346
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:19,099
musical instrument those never go away go

347
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:20,149
away

348
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:22,599
but holy [ __ ]

349
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,680
here now surely you will not hear

350
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:36,040
about one will come are one or two hands hold me

351
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,400
microphone in this very

352
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:49,930
dangerous way no yes now wanting to have a

353
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,240
bit of skill you can play many

354
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,930
songs because the feedback is  two

355
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:02,590
which implies that it is stereo

356
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:06,580
ok and also implies that we can really

357
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,310
humanly have two octaves of

358
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,860
precision and we can make many

359
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,990
songs as well as it is clear that there are

360
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,820
sharps because they are important

361
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:23,050
there is everything is a serious instrument is

362
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,340
something that  is I was working on

363
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,800
tonight I could not finish it is

364
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:37,740
the final ante lization if god wants it

365
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,520
is off

366
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:10,740
we have this raspberry with new

367
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,790
corner

368
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,740
keep this in mind because things will happen

369
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:57,559
ok wait what you want

370
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:03,179
tetris talks about cyan escapement

371
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:09,029
again and i know no i'm still ahead

372
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:28,399
so this is i know

373
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:39,119
i left something open

374
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:56,850
somewhere we do things we can before i

375
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:02,850
found these games is playable  the

376
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,169
music comes directly from the

377
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:20,399
controller and nothing 5 minutes so if

378
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,200
you have any questions to ask him over tell them

379
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,580
are the vibrators turning in a circle

380
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,429
times have three parameters you pass them

381
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:36,330
the anpi cud for the period and the game

382
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,489
then simply you run them the

383
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:41,960
correct frequency and  makes the note

384
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:46,830
exactly the same speech other

385
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,580
questions also really stupid even at the

386
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,479
relate seen with four minutes

387
00:28:53,479 --> 00:29:04,190
nothing until then the music and it must be done

388
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:08,309
and I did not do it all because I did not have

389
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:12,619
time start again from there

390
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,590
if you come to the cup of rust I will

391
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,850
show you  protruding maybe

392
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:28,189
let's not trust we play so you can do it
