00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,790
I am marco ditri

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,640
today I want to talk about the internet of

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,600
things

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,840
what is it

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,160
that which implications above all

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,020
practical for those who buy things from the

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,300
internet and something connected

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,019
to the internet of things is a

9
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:26,449
very generic definition

10
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,880
also each each to their own I

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,610
have chosen this it is about

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,070
massive machine to machine communications

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,129
i.e. objects that have sensors that

14
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:42,780
acquire characteristics of the

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,600
environment it can be the temperature

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,260
how much gas has passed in the pipe

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,840
who has passed by wearing an NFC tag

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,730


19
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,860
or actuators

20
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,989
I turn on the air conditioner I open the door

21
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,719
of the house

22
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,520
something that  changes the state

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,589
of the environment

24
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,510
these objects have connectivity

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,380
that makes them accessible in some way

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,850
via the internet to their owners or to

27
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,610


28
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,580
a third party or to the whole world if

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,720
they are not built very well

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,909
from these premises in theory

31
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,360
a business model should be built  that allows you

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,000
to earn the

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,790
internet of things is not an internet

34
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,759
special  and it is that piece of internet

35
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,460
that serves that not that is

36
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,500
used to manage communications

37
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,299
between objects instead of between objects and

38
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,810
people

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,630
there can exist

40
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,490
internet of things devices that also

41
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,259
interact with humans for

42
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,560
example a mason dash and

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,810
a small  button that you can buy

44
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,080
for a few euros you put it at home and

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,480
when you press it orders a specific

46
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,209
product on amazon its main purpose

47
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:15,069


48
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,590
is to a in this object to a let's say

49
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,980
a user interface that with which the

50
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,860
public people interact but

51
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,170
the  its main purpose is to talk to

52
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,359
amazon to do something

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,760
another object

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,650
that is part of the internet of things

55
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,769
somehow it is a cellphone

56
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:42,739
more or less we all have a cellphone

57
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:45,260
per se because its reason for being

58
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,160
a connectivity is the internet and

59
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,670
a whole  series of

60
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,670
audio video sensors trivially, however, knows the

61
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,489
mobile phone knows where you are at that moment knows

62
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,380
how you are moving knows in what

63
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,049
position respect  or to you the environment

64
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:08,540
maybe vnc interacts with other

65
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,690
more or less smart objects maybe less

66
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,209
smart bnf they simply tell us who they

67
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:18,489
are if they are smarter they can

68
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,200
give more complex information they

69
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,930
can establish a dialogue that

70
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,299
could also be an exchange of

71
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:28,150
money for example

72
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,579
a  object of this kind allows

73
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,819
liveblogging which is the recording

74
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:37,970
of one's activities everything

75
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,440
I do

76
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,170
is recorded and then comfortably I

77
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,540
see it again if you have seen black mirror

78
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,760
you know what I am talking about if you have not

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,139
seen it fix it because

80
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:54,049
in our community we say that  deals

81
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:56,870
with extremely important issues

82
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,079
and it is interesting to note that the

83
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,569
person who produces the data buys the mobile phone but not the

84
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:05,150
person who analyzes them

85
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,569
himself my mobile phone instead of making my

86
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:10,610
beautiful video recording etc. that I

87
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,540
keep aside and look at myself calmly

88
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,370
generates a whole series of data  for

89
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,978
example where are they right now who

90
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:22,900
has passed by me and

91
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,320
uploads them to the cloud

92
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,979
for good  fice of some service

93
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,080
maybe

94
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,610
owned managed by whoever sold me

95
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,080
the mobile phone in this

96
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,410
case my data is generated by me from an

97
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,750
object that I paid for but they

98
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,720
end up in someone else's systems with

99
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,000
whom

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,280
I will have some kind of contract which

101
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,460
however  it is all to be seen how much my

102
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,970
favor is with these data then what control

103
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,639
will I have

104
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,800
these data once they come out of

105
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,380
my availability obviously they are

106
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,740
accessible to any

107
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,690
judicial or even extra judicial action

108
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,460
by a national state

109
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,830
so we return to the popular topic in

110
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,330
recent years  and of mass surveillance as

111
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,320
long as the data generated by my

112
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,449
things internet of things which is not

113
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,250
necessarily the mobile phone the

114
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,560
thermostat in my house knows when I am at

115
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,310
home if it tells google googles

116
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,840
when I am at home

117
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,849
if the united states government asks

118
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:36,889
google when i'm at home the

119
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:39,440
united states government drinks tell them and the

120
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,419
united states government can

121
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:45,280
bomb me with a drone eg  impious

122
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,300
aid at all costs

123
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,810
in recent years there are

124
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,180
many people at many companies have

125
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,510
tried to sell objects aid of

126
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,120
all kinds a little beyond what is

127
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,430
common sense

128
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,880
would suggest a little beyond what are

129
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,850
the actual

130
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,600
demands of consumers now  if

131
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,550
we are here we say that many of us

132
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,530
certainly like

133
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,270
technological gadgets that

134
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,210
said if my washing machine speaks

135
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,820
wifi and this is not a

136
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,970
hypothetical cohesion the high-end washing machines

137
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,360
of samsung speak wifi

138
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,650
what do i do what use

139
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,250
it warns me when it is finished  washing

140
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,000
ok

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,410
and then if my toaster speaks wifi in

142
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,590
as

143
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,990
right

144
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,120
if my this bread speaks wifi in

145
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,430
some way and improves the quality of

146
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,010
my life

147
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:01,040
if the light bulbs in my house speak

148
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,610
wifi some other protocol then

149
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,720
intermediated by an object that speaks

150
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,880
wifi

151
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,000
that what problem have I solved if I can

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,790
turn on the bulbs with my mobile phone

153
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,280
what I have gained

154
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,200
surely I know what I have lost there are

155
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,140
in this chain  to a bunch of objects and

156
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,600
services that can break prevent me

157
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,650
from turning on the lights in the living

158
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,050
room so in my opinion it is important to

159
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,330
ask yourself in front of an

160
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,120
internet of things object

161
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,920
what advantages it brings

162
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,880
what advantages it brings to me

163
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,280
who is the real customer of whom  I am his customer who sells it to

164
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,390
me

165
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,980
or his customer is the one who buys my

166
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,890
more or less aggregated data for which I who

167
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,900
buy a wifi bulb a wifi thermostat

168
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,650
a wifi washing machine am the customer

169
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,980
or I am the product

170
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,560
despite having paid to take me

171
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,850
home  a concrete object

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,430
always online

173
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,390
the beauty is the problem with these objects

174
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,220
is that they

175
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,650
are part of the internet

176
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,830
in this way

177
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,900
you have the opportunity to have in

178
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,230
your daily life all the annoyances

179
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,960
and things you hate about the internet

180
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,980
pervasive advertising for example there is a

181
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,620
television from a rather

182
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,640
well-known manufacturer that after a while it was put up for

183
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,220
sale started showing

184
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,510
advertisements on

185
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,810
your home screen  data generated by these

186
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,150
devices can be sold to

187
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,240
third parties

188
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,650
here once they are sold to third parties

189
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,500
the problem of mass surveillance comes into play

190
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,390
these third parties

191
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,970
may be obliged sometimes

192
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,340
they simply do it

193
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,780
willingly for money but they may also

194
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,850
be obliged to give this data  to

195
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,840
someone here you would not want

196
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,600
the intrusion security problems

197
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,230
typical of the internet

198
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,000
any object that is on the internet is

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,210
constantly under attack from people

200
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,030
who generally do it for a living and

201
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,870
are very motivated to break through your

202
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,410
object whether it is the mobile phone, the PC or the

203
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,360
washing machine to earn somehow

204
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,480


205
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,080
and unlike facebook which

206
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,330
provides you with advertising in exchange

207
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,010
for your data and photos of your

208
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,550
cats, you pay for these things at least

209
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,370
with traditional online services there is a

210
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,710
bit of this do ut des I give you

211
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,750
everything  the whole story of my life or

212
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,340
at least the whole story of my

213
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,620
life that I want to publish if s  am a

214
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,990
person a little bit aware and in

215
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,450
exchange you give me a platform that

216
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,190
allows me to see the photos of my friends' cats

217
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,160


218
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,800
to decentralize these objects but

219
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,810
at this moment there are

220
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,360
objective technological limits if my

221
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,530
washing machine speaks wifi or a normal

222
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,830
connection  to the internet

223
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,170
presumably indeed in Italy

224
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,999
certainly with excellent approximation

225
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:40,350
I will have a probably dynamic ipv4 address in my house

226
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,480


227
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,869
that changes depending on how my

228
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:49,769
connectivity provider runs

229
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,319
if I have more than one ip device in

230
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,609
my house I will have to have more than one ip from

231
00:10:56,609 --> 00:11:01,209
game signals  force an act is necessary which,

232
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,959
however, has the

233
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,709
essential effect of breaking the

234
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:09,249
end-to-end connectivity the object the

235
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:10,779
washing machine I have in the house the

236
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:13,239
air conditioner I have in the house

237
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,089
cannot be reached from the outside except

238
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:16,829


239
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:20,589
when it is they who connect to a

240
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:23,199
some object external to my

241
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:27,970
home network that will act as a meeting point

242
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,749
between what is in my house and the other things

243
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:34,029
that  they want to talk to him that

244
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:36,009
my mobile phone could be the

245
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:39,549
browser on my pc or the cloud service

246
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:42,429
of the supplier of the person who produced

247
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:44,519
the object who

248
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,199
wants to access this information to

249
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:50,699
provide you with a service of some kind

250
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:53,319
this is a solution of this kind

251
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:55,360
to the obvious  disadvantage that introduces a

252
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,790
single point of failure

253
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,639
if this online service breaks down and

254
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,769
all online services break sooner

255
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,829
or later there is little to do

256
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:08,199
I will no longer be able to connect to the washing machine

257
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:11,100
at home to do things

258
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,649
if there is an object outside  my home that

259
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,329
receives my data this data

260
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:19,059
will be out of my control and

261
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:22,329
will be accessible to others if there is an

262
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,939
object from outside my home that

263
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:29,110
mediates my interactions with

264
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,629
internet objects that I have at home

265
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,939
if it is not  very well organized

266
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:39,789
means that whoever controls this

267
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:42,689
external object who accesses it

268
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:46,570
event possibly without my

269
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,160
permission without the permission of whoever

270
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,770
manages the service can control the

271
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,530
washing machine in my house does not know for what

272
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,780
purpose but I am sure that there are

273
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,060
gentlemen in russia and ukraine who

274
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,800
are already studying us and will find a

275
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,770
business model on this too

276
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:06,580
the solution to avoid nats and one is

277
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,450
well tested at this point  and ipv6

278
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,140
will be discussed in another talk today

279
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,350
another benefit of ipv6 is that it

280
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,660
allows me to have

281
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,680
more than one logical network in the house very easily because

282
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,230
if your just decent provider

283
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,530
won't provide you with an ipv6 network it

284
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,030
will provide a certain  number to stay low

285
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,520
256 ipv6 networks that we say are more than

286
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,370
enough for any

287
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,710
normal home in this way with a

288
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,500
router access point home modem a

289
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,050
minimum intelligent that is not

290
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,000
science fiction there are already devices of

291
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,839
this kind can manage more lan in

292
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,170
my home lan also wifi  obviously with

293
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,110
different levels of security firewall

294
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,860
dragon the other to segregate the

295
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,420
devices I don't trust which

296
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,339
should be all those

297
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:12,040
I don't have  access to sources and

298
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,200
possibly speaking that are

299
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,410
controllable by third parties from external third parties

300
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,260


301
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,150
how to decentralize once we

302
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,190
have re-established end

303
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,140
to end connectivity

304
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,420
in any case this does not

305
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,450
completely solve the problem

306
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,490
I should generally have an

307
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,530
internet of things devices, however

308
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,930
intelligent  they have

309
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,300
rather limited computing capacity maybe they

310
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,610
speak wifi but they have a few kilobytes

311
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,680
of ram

312
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,420
very slow processors that can

313
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,180
receive commands to do things send

314
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,790
information but cannot provide for

315
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,100
example a

316
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,259
modern application accessible through my

317
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:58,569
browser generally need some

318
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:01,149
intermediate object

319
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:04,480
there are such things both

320
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,470
amazon with co and google with hub but

321
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,959
very recently they have tried to

322
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,899
launch services of this kind

323
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:16,509
that aim to aggregate what

324
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:18,430
are the internet of things objects in

325
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,310
my house and then provide ways to

326
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,970
control them coordinate them

327
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,540
we also think ban  to a situation of

328
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,639
smart power grid in which I have

329
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,480
appliances that coordinate

330
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,639
with mine supplied the

331
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,889
electricity distributor in my city to

332
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:42,250
decide maybe the washing machine starts in

333
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,470
half an hour because at this moment

334
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,399
there is a peak of load  in exchange for a

335
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,930
ypsilon less the current that

336
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,860
will consume the problem two problems

337
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,630
meanwhile there are no standard protocols

338
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,709
for which each

339
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,220
manufacturer of

340
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,810
internet of things bulbs rather than

341
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,149
toasters will adopt its own protocol

342
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:09,490
that does not interact with the hubs of

343
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,560


344
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,949
others until now  who

345
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:16,209
started selling objects of this

346
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:20,290
kind is a big

347
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,990
cloud service provider precisely amazon and google there

348
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,810
are no bigger ones so they do

349
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,870
n't actually have an interest in

350
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,870


351
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,699
decentralization decentralization that is

352
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:35,560
centralization is not essential

353
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,439
for many things to turn on  my

354
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:40,180
light bulb i don't need i don't

355
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,870
need a cloud service that analyzes  i when

356
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,449
the hundred e makes me graphics or

357
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:49,329
what are all things that can be

358
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:51,250
done safely inside my house

359
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,910
but providing it through a cloud service

360
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,399
allows you to create a walled garden

361
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,959
that

362
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:02,350
binds me binds me to this producer

363
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,750
on the other hand have services  cloud

364
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,179
that aggregate data allows you to

365
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:10,689
create new databases that

366
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:13,559
can provide

367
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,150
new information that was not previously

368
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,669
available

369
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,289
allow us to discover new things about

370
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,169
ourselves about society in general allow you

371
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:26,709
to create new services and

372
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,900
business models that did not exist before and  they

373
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,570
were not possible due to technological limitations

374
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,770
problem related to centralization

375
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,799
when I buy an object a refrigerator

376
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,289
a pan

377
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:44,909
this

378
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:47,650
will continue to work even after

379
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,330
the manufacturer has stopped selling it

380
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,880
cells in the house the power connection

381
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,760
works fantastic

382
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,039
if there is no more technical assistance

383
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,919
for the  my washing machine

384
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,720
will surely exist in my city of

385
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,669
craftsmen  ians who will be able to

386
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:05,950
repair them so that this economically

387
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,169
makes sense even many years after the

388
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:11,080
manufacturer has stopped producing and

389
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,559
selling an internet object but it

390
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,950
loses all or part of its functions

391
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,150
when when I pay attention not if when

392
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,429
the cloud service through which it is

393
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:26,280
managed

394
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,870
did not work.  because temporarily

395
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:34,110
broken or because the manufacturer stops

396
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,659
managing it because this thing costs me I

397
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,990
buy an internet of things light bulb

398
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,659
for 15 euros

399
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:45,610
and a led light bulb

400
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,580
will reasonably last me 15 years on

401
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,860
who sold it to me but by now they didn't sell it to me

402
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,620
expect more money from me

403
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,010
and not a particular incentive other

404
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,580
than simply to maintain

405
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,640
the image of a company that you don't

406
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,370
care to

407
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,230
continue to support online services

408
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,730
that allow me to

409
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,059
turn this light bulb on and off here is a who

410
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:15,790
it has a clear economic problem of

411
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,010
incentives that somehow should

412
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,100
be solved by either decentralizing

413
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,710
or finding a way to go about it  these

414
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,390
online services are

415
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,060
economically viable until now the only way

416
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,010
we know is that these online services I

417
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,260
resell in my data to someone

418
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,720
and it is not hypothetical issues

419
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,280
for example revolver is a

420
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,370
domestic system of orchestration

421
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,290
centralization of services etc.

422
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,390
produced by a '  company that was

423
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:52,030
bought by nest of google alphabet

424
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,070
last year

425
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,080
after which

426
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,250
google decided that it no longer wanted it no

427
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,560
longer had an interest in supporting

428
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,410
this product

429
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,950
a couple of months ago it ended it shut down

430
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,380
the servers that manage it who

431
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,140
bought it  this ram object is found a

432
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,240
design paperweight at home it is

433
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,210
totally useless it has no possibility to

434
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,460
modify it to use a

435
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,530
third party service because it does not contain

436
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,690
free software it is not documented its full

437
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,870
are documented

438
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,550
so the commercial models if I

439
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:35,440
buy something I take it to  house and it

440
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,030
works until it breaks until you

441
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,580
count if it breaks it continues to have it

442
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,620
repaired until you decide  or maybe that

443
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,960
it is no more energy efficient

444
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,760
than a modern product and then I

445
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,080
throw it away

446
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,850
you buy an internet thing two

447
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,930
possibilities I buy the object and this

448
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,620
speaks to a cloud service that I

449
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,540
will continue to have for free as long as the

450
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,840
supplier the producer of the object

451
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,250
will want to support it alternatively

452
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,110
I buy a cloud service that gives me

453
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,030
free or political price in some

454
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,610
object that uses it then I will pay a

455
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,590
recurring fee for this

456
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,880
cloud service and I will have some object at home

457
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,270
that uses it let's go back to da mason dash

458
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,850
actually I bought  first of amazon I

459
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,710
bought the ride

460
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:36,129
the amazon and amazon bring me things home

461
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,559
to encourage me to buy things

462
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,519
with the minimum possible friction gives me

463
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:45,009
for a negligible cost a button that

464
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:47,889
I press it and tomorrow I get home

465
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,409
the sand for the cat  or what I

466
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:54,809
wanted to buy the detergent etc.

467
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,509
we should find some model

468
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:02,279
that allows those who sell items

469
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,080
internet of th  ings to support

470
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,479
cloud services

471
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:09,899
on the other hand it is a bit complicated to

472
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:14,019
convince consumers that if they buy

473
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:17,169
an internet of things refrigerator

474
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,450
for the life of the object they will have to

475
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,309
pay something because it continues to

476
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:22,289
work

477
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:25,389
they are not used to it

478
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:26,909
and right and wrong

479
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:30,279
is a matter  that will need to be

480
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:33,909
socially debated at the level of

481
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:36,549
people involved in

482
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:38,820
sales marketing certainly not a

483
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,859
question I have an answer to today

484
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:47,679
the extremely important related problem

485
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,090


486
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,759
I bought a refrigerator

487
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,919
I want to modify it to make it

488
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,629
colder the warmer it lights up  in a certain

489
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:57,629
way it has stroboscopic lights

490
00:22:57,629 --> 00:23:00,340
inside and I do what

491
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,479
I want with it

492
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,639
I bought a car

493
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:06,729
I want to put the special muffler that

494
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:09,639
makes me rattles and mine until it is

495
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:12,849
approved and the state does not tell me anything

496
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,149
I can do it freely

497
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:16,710
problem

498
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,909
eventually I will have  of

499
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:22,090
warranty problems assistance with the person who

500
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,129
sold it to me if he brings it to him a  repair

501
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:26,940
to him if I take it to an

502
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,950
independent workshop they will be able to repair this

503
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,830
object even if I have modified it

504
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,830
are matters between me my mechanic

505
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,149
if this object but inside a

506
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,949
software that a proprietary software

507
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:44,720
I have not bought this software

508
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,539
maximum purchased a license  for the use

509
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:50,390
of this software but typically of

510
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,429
this software not us sources so

511
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:54,230
I don't know how it works

512
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,000
I don't have the right to study and

513
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,330
modify it which for a software is a

514
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,549
rather big limitation because

515
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:05,230
maybe this software has bugs

516
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,390
that I would like to solve  before

517
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,299
the producer does it as long as he wants to

518
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,840
do it maybe I want this

519
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,390
software to have the blue interface instead of

520
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,429
yellow that the producer does not

521
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:21,620
care to make this change because

522
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,350
only I want the blue interface if

523
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,539
it were free software I could do it

524
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:29,240
easily you can  paying someone to

525
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,320
do it for me is not free software

526
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,110
in europe we have a little advantage

527
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,289
perc  hé there are laws that

528
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:41,299
allow us to reverse engineer

529
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:43,580
the software for these purposes

530
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,370
in the united states instead

531
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,169
there is the ems and other countries and

532
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:51,080
unfortunately other similar laws that prohibit me

533
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,230


534
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,270
from modifying this software if this

535
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,030
software has technical measures that

536
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,850


537
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,860
prevent when I lose control of

538
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,559
this software I also lose control

539
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,159
to repair this object for example

540
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,299
Tesla cars have a very

541
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:16,039
series of software inside that in

542
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,650
controlling every aspect

543
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,090
if I do not have control of this

544
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,340
software in practice I do not  I can

545
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,900
repair so I must necessarily

546
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,130
rely on the manufacturer for each

547
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,789
technical intervention

548
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:34,309
lyautey depends on the software if this

549
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,020
if the manufacturer decides not to

550
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,169
update the software anymore

551
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:43,299
I can not do anything for which I

552
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:46,669
propose this idea an aid object

553
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:49,990
must have software that is free and

554
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,679
modifiable  from whoever buys it

555
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,080
also

556
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,929
for lyautey the speech is extremely important

557
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:02,059
security that the only

558
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:05,210
moment in this presentation in which

559
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,919
I will touch it because we could

560
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:08,990
talk about it for hours about the security problems of

561
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,360
internet of

562
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,210
things objects that we have already seen so far

563
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,120
in general any

564
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,780
computer device that will have security problems

565
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,830
and  it is quite inevitable

566
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,659
given that the state of this

567
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:30,700
industry is the only known solution and

568
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,860
patiently once the security problems have been identified

569
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,409
solve and

570
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:37,750
update them

571
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,100
you go back to the point where

572
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,740
someone has to do that, that is, someone wants

573
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,899
to update these

574
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:50,780
software if not  the manufacturer does it I have to

575
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,000
be able to do it myself

576
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,559
these updates obviously must

577
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,950
be automatic you cannot rely

578
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,200
on the consumer's goodwill in quotes

579
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,690
to update the firmware

580
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,370
of your refrigerator so that it

581
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,710
is not used to send spam it must

582
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,440
happen automatically we have already

583
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,440
seen this extensively  problem with

584
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,860
all modem routers  that

585
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,980
are supplied by manufacturers

586
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,730
more or less bug-filled generally more and

587
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,380
if they don't have an

588
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,149
automatic update mechanism they will remain

589
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:29,270
bug-filled throughout their life which

590
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,820
is a problem for those who buy them but it is a

591
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,700
public safety issue because a

592
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,669
router that a promiscuous server open

593
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:42,770
on the external interface will

594
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,049
obviously be used to create

595
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:47,570
reflection amplification attacks that

596
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,370
are a problem for the rest of the

597
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,549
internet, not simply for those

598
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:54,890
who refer to that object that is stolen a

599
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,600
little bit

600
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,659
moreover if only the manufacturer

601
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:05,090
of the  'object can release

602
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,549
software updates this

603
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:09,470
completely controls the secondary market

604
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,400


605
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,770
let's go back to the tesla example

606
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,110
if

607
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,090
you no one forbids you if you own a

608
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,220
tesla car from selling it the problem is that if

609
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,960
you buy a second hand tesla car

610
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,370


611
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,080
you have not bought  the

612
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,690
software license is not transferable there are no

613
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,390
laws that oblige you to make

614
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,280
the l  icence of a software

615
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,100
for which you have bought a

616
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,410


617
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,910
beautiful car whose software you cannot update

618
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,300
that sooner or later will be updated

619
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,060
the only way to do it is to contact the

620
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,060
manufacturer who will ask you for a figure that

621
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,970
we do not say makes it cheaper to

622
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,850
buy a car  new but this thing

623
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,180
is not invented tesla if I buy

624
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,210
a router from cisco if I do not mean if I

625
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,100
buy a second hand cisco router

626
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,250
I have not bought the ios license

627
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,120
then I have to contact cisco to

628
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,010
buy the software license

629
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,140
this router

630
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,090
problem cisco will take a huge amount of

631
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:17,060
money to sell me the license because I

632
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,950
did not buy the hardware at the same time

633
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,550


634
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,980
it goes back to the question of commercial models

635
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,450


636
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,990
at this point if I buy an object

637
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,590
for which I do not have the software

638
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,270
it suits me it really suits me

639
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,850
buying it

640
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,890
might make more sense to rent it

641
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,110
so maybe if it breaks

642
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,760
it will be replaced under warranty by the

643
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,940
supplier

644
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,620
after a certain number of a  nni the

645
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,040
supplier can

646
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,240
replace apple tree because he will have

647
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,580
organized economically and

648
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,040
technologically to do it so

649
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,350
I could have some advantages I could

650
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,150
have some advantages

651
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,420
the producer of these objects who will have

652
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,900
instead of a

653
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,480
one-off gain a gain that lasts

654
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,750
for the entire life of the object

655
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,440
this is what tesla would like to do

656
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,450
when you buy a tesla car you are

657
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,280
not really buying the batteries

658
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,879
there is a much more complicated speech

659
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:28,220
when you buy a paper book to

660
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,499
give a related example that is not

661
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:32,299
really internet ortiz but it poses the

662
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:36,470
same problems you can do with it

663
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,509
what you want you can lend it

664
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:41,629
give it make confetti if you bought an

665
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:43,029
ebook

666
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:45,740
you bought the license to read

667
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,610
those books already copying it can be

668
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:52,179
technically complicated

669
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:55,970
most likely you cannot sell it

670
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,220
probably you cannot

671
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,789
bequeath it someone this is also a

672
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:04,399
rather important question that

673
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,549
until now has been raised little for mot  there

674
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:10,669
demographic in the next few years it will start

675
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,980
to be relevant that people

676
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,249
will inherit a car

677
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,779
but not the software that makes it work

678
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:19,610
as we put it will

679
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,379
need to find a solution to these

680
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,139
points could be a more

681
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:28,220
or less fair solution for the consumer is a

682
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,490
question that will go  studied

683
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,840
if there are any questions I am at your

684
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,639
disposal

685
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:37,399
this presentation will soon be

686
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:39,590
online on my site that you can easily find by

687
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,139
searching my name with

688
00:31:42,139 --> 00:31:45,860
google thanks google otherwise here there is also

689
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,460
a small humble essential bibliography

690
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,090
a very useful twitter account that

691
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,059
every day  offers you examples of

692
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:58,789
internet of things objects of questionable quality

693
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:00,100


694
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,159
and some articles in which these topics

695
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,230
are dealt with

696
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,119
if there are any questions they are available

697
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:10,299
