1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,859
usually i do the presentation

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,750
introduce in turin enter now i

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,740
'm on the other side how did

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,540
this talk drama start try it ok

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,520
then not on facebook i asked you

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,800
matteo no please come for a

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,580
talk eg

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,199
and he yes sure tell me  what to talk about

9
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,119
okay I'll think about

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,039
the crime one day to write the abstract

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,009
of the po that we have fixed a little bit

12
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:37,860
the reread is cool and difficult I do it

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,719
only if the profits he said willingly

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,879
and so here we are you really know that

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,379
with women on  works better than with

16
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,399
the climax of the boar room and so

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,899
in reality I did not want to talk to you about very

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,910
difficult math stuff the hour is tied

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,800
at the bottom in a nook in a corner

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,600
so at least he has also learned to

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,879
pee in the right positions on

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,640
encryption applied to privacy

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,030
in reality we noticed while

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,790
we were talking that you often see parts

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,729
of tracing online, they are

26
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,939
usually old claudio with a bit of the world

27
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,920
then you see aside in m  ezzo di mancante

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,180
you are probably missing the last 8 9

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,030
years of online advertising because we are

30
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,640
stuck with cookies ok cookies are bad I

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,200
delete the cookie I delete the history they

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,720
no longer chase me online I'm happy

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,560
ok

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,430
here is mine is called the shots is called

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,470
fingal first part that  of explanation

36
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,850
of which to then understand what you want to

37
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,369
do he is called fingerprinting happy

38
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,850
what you don't know what you think you know and

39
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,100
what you are sure you know obviously

40
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,710
wrong as ciro the slides go forward

41
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,009
china and go back he works one

42
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,500
slide at a time exactly sorry  you

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,939
keep going one at a time when you

44
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,940
get to the bottom you stop

45
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,080
great now you've seen this a

46
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,610
few people both a few plugins that

47
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,500
do this when you travel on a

48
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,300
website shows you the king cole

49
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,160
that every time you freeze

50
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,200
around the net you will find a series

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,820
of tracing writings that are used

52
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,310
for advertising and so far if not me if

53
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,050
you missed this part r  we go

54
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,390
back and come back as well in 2001 when

55
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,250
claudio started talking about it we'll meet again

56
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,820
after trekking profiling profiling

57
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,050
advertising advertising more or less

58
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,930
contextual to what you do not

59
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,060
so much because the advertiser

60
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,730
loves you and wants to give you better advertising

61
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,890
but because they discovered after so many  years

62
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,650
that strangely if you don't give a

63
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,200
[ __ ] about the topic they are

64
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,180
advertising you don't click if you don't

65
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,190
click they don't have a click free

66
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,720
that is they don't have the click on the

67
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,850
advertising if they don't have the click on the advertising they

68
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,670
don't take  money

69
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,140
so if they give you stuff that you don't

70
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,180
like you don't click they don't take

71
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,630
money ok here we are

72
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,910
the other one normally says block the

73
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,950
tracking because if I delete the

74
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,260
cookies or new cookies with the new

75
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,910
cookies I no longer have the  'identity and unskilled workers

76
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,100
at regular intervals I clean and

77
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,959
they know nothing about me except what is

78
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,840
inside the cookies and each cookie

79
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,610
is different so long trac  started in

80
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,920
a different way for each cookie forward

81
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,380
from here a series of analyzes such as this

82
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,910
that shows you where the new influences

83
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,640
in your data around to show

84
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,410
claudio why his stuff

85
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,380
shows you in which jurisdictions

86
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,840
I actually think I'm browsing a page

87
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,580
in which jurisdiction instead

88
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,580
my data ends so the tracking data

89
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,700
ok go

90
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,130
on so we know everything we have the

91
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,680
solution we understand how

92
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,850
the tracking works we are happy 11

93
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:02,120
material so the solution is to kill

94
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,160
the cookies after we have killed the

95
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,910
cookies

96
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,540
we are happy and happy now great  a

97
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,250
moment sarcasm you should have understood

98
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,720
that there is no [ __ ] use to

99
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,640
delete cookies at this point if

100
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,020
you have not understood it means that I

101
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,440
was

102
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,660
sarcastic after a while in

103
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,450
reality you should have

104
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:25,030
noticed this thing much earlier because why

105
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,760
salvatore aranzulla  you ke

106
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,320
kazzo joke of that photo I made it I

107
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:39,740
swear to god it also took a lot of

108
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,370
know  Doing by sending warnings to the various

109
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,560
newspapers that used it the money I

110
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,330
take ends up in a sort of non-di

111
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,010
in a profit year that you know well

112
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,660
because there is another prick where the other

113
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,460
cation of akimbo between the hello with the

114
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,510
hand

115
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,480
here it is  there that it has more or less the same

116
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,160
association

117
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,810
so in reality aranzulla has given a

118
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,340
lot to charity with its image

119
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,000
did you know hashtag did you know why to

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,260
put blue to make fun of me

121
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,390
because you will have seen around now that

122
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,160
almost all advertisers are

123
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,960
taking countermeasures for  a di block

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,670
i.e. you block

125
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,900
the advertising and the site gets angry if

126
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,580
you put a di blocks you make varicose the

127
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,380
site gets angry it blocks etc.

128
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:31,160
then go if you delete the advertisements

129
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,830
the market gets angry correct

130
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,730
go if you delete the cookies and the

131
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,710
treatment and scripts do not

132
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,320
nobody gives a damn but from scratch you

133
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,260
have never seen a website that says

134
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,770
bad jerk colon cookies are

135
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,050
necessary to go on to ria

136
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,790
balance cookies but you haven't seen

137
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,660
one

138
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,540
ok suggestion ask yourself some questions

139
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,200
give yourself some answers

140
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,310
this is the market attitude

141
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,260
towards the activist's efforts to

142
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,180
block the train online tracking

143
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,600
ok is the same as the dog owner in the

144
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,010
moment  where the dog bars the

145
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,570
shoes you know that the most

146
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,310
accredited theory is that the dog eats

147
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,500
shoes because you put your shoes on

148
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,660
before you leave the house and therefore does not

149
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,849
want you

150
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:30,649
to stay at home and therefore rosicky and eats your

151
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:34,099
shoes ok that  who manages to be a

152
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:36,020
puppy by eating my shoes to

153
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,599
prevent you from leaving the house is

154
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,539
exactly the same thing that

155
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:42,860
the activist can do in

156
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,719
blocking advertising to block the fact of

157
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:51,199
being profiled 1 to 1 ok 3 assumptions

158
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,449
about which  almost

159
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:54,979
everything you find at indian

160
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,770
blocking anti profiling script blocking is based

161
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,379
and the assumptions one that the

162
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,740
cookie is the sine qua non

163
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,619
necessary for pr  to ofilate in your

164
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:08,419
online path and therefore to

165
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:09,889
profile your consumption habits

166
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:12,979
the second is that the cookies contain the

167
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,389
data we cookies do not contain the data

168
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,099
but the cookies are the necessary part

169
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:18,589
to put your historical

170
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:20,839
browsing data with your identity and

171
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,699
therefore having the navigation history

172
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,529
so without any who is there undermining the

173
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:27,319
cookies planing the cookies all the

174
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,749
history that I accumulate is

175
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,279
no longer expired so I no longer have history

176
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,079
historical part about you

177
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,680
the third supposition is that the rests td

178
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,279
data are  different buckets that is the data

179
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,800
of facebook are of facebook the data of

180
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,269
twitter are of twitter the data of the

181
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:45,589
corriere della sera are the corriere

182
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,209
della sera the data of the advertising

183
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:49,819
manager of google that is doubleclick are

184
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,219
of doubleclick that is that everyone has to

185
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:55,219
put on a trekking with different  in fact

186
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:57,079
you see a lot of tracking when

187
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,149
you go to do that [ __ ] in the morning to

188
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:01,309
get the profiling data the

189
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:05,479
implied  è there is no interpenetration

190
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:08,899
between the individual buckets inter are all

191
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:14,629
three digs ok cookie the cookie is

192
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,459
everyone's enemy no the cookie is used

193
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:19,159
to track the subtitle which was

194
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,869
a couple of balls but it seemed

195
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:22,669
excessive to me to put my slides so I

196
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,240
don't  I put this is one of the various

197
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,099
hardware based profiling systems

198
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,889
you can find the little online

199
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,159
the mouse movements recognize with an

200
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,599
extreme reliability in percentage

201
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,659
the user to the

202
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,390
inter who is behind the computer at

203
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,750
that moment even through thor

204
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,400
calculate that it is not  it must

205
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,620
be a perfect science nobody gives a

206
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,360
damn about

207
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,190
your name and surname at this moment,

208
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,230
however, it is interesting to have habits tastes

209
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,020
consumption mainly intentions

210
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,110
purchase intent the thing the goods that cost the

211
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,760
most in the advertising market as

212
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,470
we will see  first in the art of reality in

213
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,040
bing is the intention to do something

214
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,290
i mean i am going to change the

215
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,050
car and then i massacre you  and I

216
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,560
shatter your balls with advertising

217
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,470
linked to another vehicle or

218
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,360
different payment options

219
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,240
I make a lease that does it rental

220
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,510
things of this type is not the only one there

221
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,090
are dozens of them how to use for example

222
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,400
light sensor the light sensor for

223
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,200
even map the size then

224
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,330
because there are related papers they are

225
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,220
wonderful to map for example the

226
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,110
size and the number of rooms

227
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,690
in the house and therefore get

228
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,210
information on income strangely if you

229
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,640
live in a 75 rooms

230
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,740
you have a higher income lives in a

231
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,760
studio apartment that  what but corradini on

232
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,030
mistake but these technologies rightly

233
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,290
only serve to find

234
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,000
a unique identity from the person who

235
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,800
surfs he does not give a damn nobody

236
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,530
can associate name and surname to those who move

237
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,840
the mans in this way right

238
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,300
will not be important it is true he does not give a

239
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,570
damn  but it does it but because it does it in

240
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,610
reverse your name and surname your

241
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,070
identity is one of the parameters that are

242
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,370
used  to make recon syle

243
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,400
understand different buckets different

244
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,750
things you do after you have deleted

245
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,460
the cookie is for all this it is not

246
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,170
cookie based none of this and

247
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,890
gloomy based ok you arrive you have your

248
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,290
nice cookie delete the q you

249
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,690
feel them thatcher of e  has deleted

250
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,480
the cookie names trace no longer any

251
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,080
quagmires go to the site that

252
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,930
fingerprinting the

253
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,430
display part and viri is playing

254
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,310
exactly the same cupids before

255
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,390
exactly identical no

256
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,040
there will be different but inside there

257
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,780
will be hot oils which is exactly

258
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,370
the same

259
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,790
ok it is not  a new thing in 2010 I

260
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,900
think the very

261
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,050
funny toy of the ever cookie was released which

262
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,420
saved inside the academy 5

263
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,030
data storage flash gen system

264
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,040
tried to retire you on the same cucchi

265
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,950
did not work and above all it did not

266
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,500
work and was recovered by

267
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,990
that but why browser problems

268
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:28,250
you review these were theoretical this

269
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,450
is true silver poor's

270
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,170
profiling technology  of background noises and

271
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,900
especially the insertion of

272
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,850
television programs and

273
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,190
applications of a

274
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,360
particular inaudible frequency on websites that allows you to

275
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,930
associate a browser with a

276
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,870
mobile device in the same room with a

277
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,930
television program in the same room

278
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,660
with a radio station in the same

279
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,360
room for  an appliance configured

280
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,920
specifically within the same

281
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,490
room with a very funny thing every

282
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,990
time you return inside the

283
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,330
same room you are re-attached to the

284
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,060
identity and univocal that you use

285
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,680
there is a beautiful paper now the

286
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,970
federal trade commission has said that it

287
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,320
does not  it was beautiful so they modified a bit

288
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,760
but it is a

289
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,040
commercial application this is not

290
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,470
a potentially

291
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,330
exploitability technology that is not a shelf product

292
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:29,900


293
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,610
it is called silvio burro

294
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,230
a tui create sixteen edition but marketing

295
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,530
aid to cross device identity if you are

296
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,850
looking for it  online trekking

297
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,340
try four mo activist [ __ ]

298
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,130
lto good who try to avoid it if

299
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,370
you are looking for cookie everlasting the cookie

300
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,470
you find her and pouf proof of concept

301
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,420
if you do not have the correct gameboard you

302
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,240
do not find what the market calls it and

303
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,740
you will find a lot of funny things

304
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,970
about new terms that you have never

305
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,910
heard today cross  device identity is the

306
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,590
new but because we are interested in cross

307
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:16,600
device identity sasso yesterday cross

308
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,730
device trekking isin cookies we do not need

309
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,780
what we need unique and

310
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,970
recovered in a thousand different ways that

311
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,460
allows you to trace the cookie is

312
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,310
a means that for now is

313
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,340
temporary is a convenient way to save

314
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,200
this data because it is convenient because

315
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,970
normally the calls to the other data

316
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,990
are paid

317
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,650
so if I have to get

318
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,830
hicks user profile I have to buy a service

319
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,700
that makes me pay for each col if it makes them

320
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,950
pay for every col me  it becomes

321
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,440
uneconomical to do it every time and

322
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,750
therefore too much away a cookie that has the sole

323
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,180
purpose of not tracking you track you with

324
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,250
a cookie plus a [ __ ] a  none but

325
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,750
the only purpose of making sure you have

326
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,870
a cache to pay ten times to

327
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,310
always get the same user

328
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:16,690
ok hugo cross device identity is no longer

329
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,990
only in the browser and the browser is in the app is

330
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,540
in the appliance is in the service applications

331
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:30,520
set top  box services websites in various

332
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,430
connotations because because because in

333
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,770
reality the problem was another it arises

334
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,110
with the almost noble intent

335

00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,269
different people for the website but in reality it

344
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:06,490
is not true I am  one person and therefore

345
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,649
I have to spend n times to do one

always have the possibility to

373
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,069
implement it natively so at least

374
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:43,509
applications can generate

376
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,319

of any gates that as you have seen they

455
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,880
hardly count for a [ __ ] if they

456
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,690
are cheaper which

457
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,370
is worth putting because I don't have to

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,180
very convenient because not to use them in the

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,620
that did nothing but

502
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,810
re-profile the person take in the

503
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,060
navigation the only ones and go must

504
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,310
recover there is already someone who does it

505
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,350
commercially this job what the [ __ ] do

506
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,030
I have to break my  tracing balls

507
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,410

513
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,680
playful parenthesis you pronounce it diem psp of aspi

514
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,140
but in reality you have to read it with

515
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,270
something called cookie sinking you

516
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,310
remember the third then there were three

517
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,570
things 1 cookies serve [ __ ] two

518
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,640
cookies year my preferences [ __ ]

519
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,760
3 each one must have his own cookie

520
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,380
because otherwise I can't profile

521
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,440
welcome to the nice world of cookie

522
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,070
sinking how does the sync between

523
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,950
supply and demand work

524
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,860
simple twenty cars to serve

525
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,059
you are having integration bay

526
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:44,450
sorry server  to server integration

527
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,970
bass so you don't see [ __ ]

528
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,450


529
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,870
ok don't block it script side played

530
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,419
with activist [ __ ] ok server

531
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:58,100
on server script a frequency cup of

532
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,929
fun put a pixel to

533
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:01,760
avoid this trip you have to do it again because

534
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,260
if you already have the  cookie set by

535
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,210
both parties you avoid having to redo the

536
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,389
sinking but once again cookies or

537
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:10,850
pixels in those who are not needed to give away

538
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,519
the more I talk to you to find yourself they are only

539
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,870
and exclusively to avoid making

540
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,730
calls having to pay them so if you

541
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,200
surf an hour and you see a thousand pages

542
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,299
I make a call and not a thousand calls

543
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:23,470
that cost me a thousand times as much

544
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,450
in an ideal world this still craxi

545
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,340
then there are all  the links then you can

546
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,100
go and study to see it

547
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,240
advertiser internet provider the user

548
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,710
who surfs in the middle we have the

549
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,289
exchange and that is the one who has to beat

550
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:37,970
the banner who doesn't know [ __ ] about me

551
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,820
because he never knows nothing has

552
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,830
my things inside  but only a banner on

553
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,970
the other side we have the

554
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,909
retargeting platform that sees not only where I

555
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:48,980
go to advertising do what you want to do

556
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,080
but simca sees that thing remains

557
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,820
and throws it out to me the two systems

558
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,700
theoretically according to the graph

559
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,929
we have was  beginning they should have

560
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,149
put me two different installations with

561
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:00,860
two different tracking to know

562
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,820
my whole story

563
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,710
no sys inc a non if they pass them one with

564
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,970
the other end of the g  iochi

565
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,889
vai 21 server to server is

566
00:25:09,889 --> 00:25:12,049
evil inps due server to server you don't see it

567
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:13,909
with games

568
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:17,000
I think

569
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,679
you can already see the next step if you understand

570
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,059
more or less how the fun step works

571
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:23,710
you see it is called da as

572
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:28,909
d '  age as a service that is we have seen

573
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:31,940
that I all the navigation my user

574
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,559
cookie lorito until he puts his

575
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:36,919
things china the to all his things profile

576
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:38,210
puts his things back

577
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,460
if we want we can agree

578
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,409
for a mutual interest and we can

579
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:44,269
pass cookies  things I know what he knows

580
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:44,780


581
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,520
from what I know I can actually

582
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,340
choose only one direction

583
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,820
the problem is that if I in the classroom do not

584
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,090
know [ __ ] about you who surf

585
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,070
we have never seen the first lap

586
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,300
you do on our system

587
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,030
I don't know [ __ ] I feel with him

588
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,910
telling me they would know [ __ ]

589
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,520
neither do you want to tell me that someone

590
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,870
made es so brilliant that he made a

591
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,630
central repository where users

592
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,260
placed being paid m  to send navigation data

593
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,060
and take money or

594
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,650
if necessary make a server call

595
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,590
to serve to retrieve data such as

596
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,890
an exchange data exchange that is a

597
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,240
system that has only the data does not

598
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,610
give a [ __ ] about sending you banners and the

599
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:39,110
means are userprofile database  int

600
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,750
here is where you have to say oh [ __ ]

601
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:47,660
right ok and it's wonderful and

602
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,790
wonderful because from my point of

603
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,800
view i have been seeing all the

604
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,530
people jumping around doing the activity block

605
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,300
this block this wood that and it's

606
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,790
beautiful and wonderful especially

607
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:03,639
for  the [ __ ] that then that you look and dc

608
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,640
and do a lot the fact of saying no they

609
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,900
will never pierce me because I am the server

610
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,910
updated to the latest passion

611
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,290
look at the face rhyme yesterday telli

612
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,140
when you tell him the cell phone sin

613
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,240
is the latest version of  fish those the

614
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,920
face that I do when they tell me I

615
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,670
block in or script I put noscript but

616
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,920
you want to tell me that how many of you know

617
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,370
a company called blue create

618
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,560
prefect earn  na more money than all the

619
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,940
companies you can think of except

620
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,620
google etc. and it was bought by

621
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,220
oracle

622
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,300
what blue does that is beautiful is the most

623
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,460
in my life if i ever go to

624
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,040
work as a state servant i

625
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,900
could go i could contemplate two

626
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,770
roads 1  the best ever real

627
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,860
what there are other iq tel

628
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,030
the investment fund of the n 6 for

629
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,600
strategic technologies is wonderful because

630
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,190
the enel if it is not that it tells you I come to you

631
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,810
and you give me straight son of a

632
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,650
[ __ ]

633
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,390
the sign I fill you  of arrows of

634
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,160
money the only thing you have to do is to let

635
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,680
me enter part of the data too and it's

636
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,020
a wonderful approach if I can't make it

637
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,090
there blu key for what does blue do

638
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,630
that first of all blue that is the

639
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,980
data service and it's wonderful  because

640
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,500
because from tesa currency the data is a

641
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,200
grace in all respects a classic and

642
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,390
shared between the user owners

643
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,020
of data and I remember the acronym but the

644
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,880
meaning was missing for a [ __ ]

645
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,460
the user in this not  enter the

646
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,770
platforms that have the data that

647
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,330
sell them to those who want to advertise not

648
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,400
on those platforms that's where you are wrong

649
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,270
ah how nice this works well

650
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,980
because then you give yourself banners I have never

651
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,720
seen an adisco banner mica they live

652
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,230
here they send you the  they give them because

653
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,260
because you have a handy repository so

654
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,820
are the official presentations there is the

655
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:11,100
pdf a handy repository of 30,000 data

you are horrible people here you

726
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:30,800
don't laugh anymore but you see it anymore because you

727
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,480
say okay but when the [ __ ] is the last

728
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,760
time I have  logged

729
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,520
in to the reserved area divided let me

730
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,380
inside never probably a pity that a

731
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,180
year or two years ago

732
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,850
your authentic shaun

733
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,310
uniform became mandatory you remember that now to play

734
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,290
the part so what do you do by

735
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,680
chance enter a payment gateway page

736
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,770
on the  divided site, however, where by chance

737
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,150
you put yours your code

738
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,340
then divided knows exactly your name and

739
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,710
surname and all your

740
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,170
spending habits etc. true by

741
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:11,360
chance you say it is true was another of the

742
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,770
moments in which you had to say oh [ __ ]

743
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:23,010
thanks of age

744
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:26,700
participate in the currency the data is a

745
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,340
consistency in step sell it

746
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:34,370
I can buy it I can increase it that is to

747
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,870
have a potentially anonymous data and

748
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,210
ask someone to recover it so

749
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,190
I no longer need to have my

750
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,410
network my script around my

751
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,160
things

752
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,830
do not  need more to need ron bloom

753
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,660
business marvel for which it may

754
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,370
be worth buying given but i can

755
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,350
call individual calls

756
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:58,200
within  a shared system already and now is

757
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,060
now we must understand that it is not

758
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,850
possible to go back when the

759
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,290
system is at these levels of

760
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,360
sophistication of fingerprinting the

761
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,909
fact of thinking that it is possible the

762
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:10,530
thing to represent your

763
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:14,190
digital life is a utopia end point the phase

764
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,050
ends  there the only thing that can

765
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,199
help us to really create a system that

766
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,460
has two two possibilities the first is that

767
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,730
it really is mathematically privacy

768
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:31,500
and in the time the first the second is we

769
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,929
are wrong but this more goes from da

770
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:39,719
to defeat there was  wrong

771
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,139
in attributing the value because the

772
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,850
owner of the data is not the

773
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,760
platform or blue that the owner

774
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,980
of the data is you and you within the

775
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,139
life cycle and within the cycle

776
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,370
of the value chain

777
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,149
you are not there now if not  you are

778
00:34:57,149 --> 00:34:59,670
paying for a service you are not

779
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,610
the user you are the goods for sale

780
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,620
welcome to understand what

781
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,430
currency they are evaluating you with

782
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,810
at the classroom rate then here of  etro

783
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,800
instead left you some stuff to go and see

784
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,870
a little what where how when but he passes by

785
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,020


786
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,690
then I wanted to start from a reflection

787
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,790
that he made precisely from those who know who is the

788
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,740
security officer of a sniffing

789
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,680
the cia investment fund  rightly I

790
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,410
would classify him as one of the good guys

791
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:41,609
even if he works for inter because he is

792
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:45,670
in my opinion a security luminary he is

793
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,180
very experienced in this field he is by no means

794
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,260
the all black hat sketch 2014 full of

795
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,300
bad people who work for good

796
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,619
people think naive exactly  he thinks but

797
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:03,730
critelli is there too he is 100 good

798
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,349
for works for those who work to understand

799
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:10,060
people think of me and he basically

800
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,570
made this observation that

801
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,090
more and more we are not in possession of our

802
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,250
personal side if I thought that when

803
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,619
we walk down the street  there is nothing

804
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:22,570
that prevents someone from taking a picture of us

805
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,790
then there is nothing that prevents

806
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,520
someone from measuring our pack

807
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,099
our our walk that even

808
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:31,630
some  knows that our heartbeat uniquely identifies us

809
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,060


810
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,220
when we are not giving at all

811
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,490
those other technologies that are

812
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,060
already in some airports if I'm wrong

813
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,619
so we are somehow losing

814
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,470
the confidentiality of the data in the

815
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:50,130
cia triad in the famous cia triad with

816
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,070
confidential files you integrity  and depending on

817
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,660
whether you are an engineer or not,

818
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,160
shaun availability but okay and then

819
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,960
what you can do now, in my opinion,

820
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,180
do what the

821
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,400
computer scientists do know or add a layer

822
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,089
of higher complexity and try to

823
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:11,950
somehow sin this

824
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,619
situation by trying to save goat and

825
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:15,960
cabbage

826
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,240
what I think we will see in the

827
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,160
near future is

828
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,589
a development of cryptographic solutions

829
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:28,869
that could be able to maintain the

830
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:31,240
confidentiality of our data and be

831
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,710
able to keep

832
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,160
all this service infrastructure in place and

833
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,799
that is now irreversible

834
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:40,390
then I thought I'd talk for a moment

835
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,180
about  three cryptographic solutions that

836
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:47,559
they are part of the

837
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,910
current research the handwriting wrapping

838
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,480
the first is the flormart king crimson where

839
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,270
practically it is the basic observation and

840
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,390
this we have been able to understand how to

841
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,130
develop insecure algorithms to

842
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,349
encrypt the data in transit

843
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:05,380
think of works ssl tls what

844
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,440
you want and encrypt static data on the

845
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,180
computer

846
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,680
missing a very important step in the chain

847
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,430
which is the encryption of the data

848
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,890
during the computation because it is

849
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,490
still not possible to do calculations on

850
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:26,140
encrypted data and in 2011 it seems to me

851
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,450
that the first cipher was proposed were the king

852
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:31,569
crimson who  it has a small problem it doesn't

853
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:33,640
scale very well so in theory it

854
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,119
works the practical situation is that

855
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,670
we can probably do two or three

856
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,680
operations on some encrypted data

857
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,990
what does this very practical example mean

858
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,779
suppose we have two or three

859
00:38:46,779 --> 00:38:49,779
and want to calculate the sum but

860
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:51,220
we do not want to do this calculation

861
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,339
we want to delegate the third party but not

862
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:56,020
my mind we do not want third parties to

863
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,150
have 2 and 3

864
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,329
ok what we do we have this cipher

865
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:05,020
we trusted 23 we send the encrypted data to the

866
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,440
server in the famous clown we

867
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,270
expect this to do the sum on

868
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:13,569
encrypted data the cyprian iris sends them back to us and

869
00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:16,920
we get the sum waiting for it

870
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,049
there are some solutions that not only

871
00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:21,869
the  floor nettles creepshow they are called

872
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:25,539
pass the graphics in crash on some

873
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:28,809
eight deaths that in trip you ca

874
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:31,660
n't practically do an

875
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,119
infinite number of blood on the data

876
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:36,849
the cabbages final publication so you

877
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:39,039
can calculate things like average and

878
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:41,259
variance not a lot though  it is already a

879
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:42,369
start

880
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:45,400
now talking to a cryptography pub he

881
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,049
explained to me that the figure

882
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:48,700
an african creepshow is no longer in fashion

883
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,890
so there are no people who research

884
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,329
more in this area

885
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,910
because it is very difficult basically

886
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,650
so we have to wait for

887
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,259
a genius to arrive again who  have the idea of the

888
00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:01,980
century and let us unlock the

889
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:10,480
difficulty in the giant fan sat the end

890
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,579
but [ __ ] in krypton was a thesis of

891
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:17,200
do  ttorato of a guy and ibm who made

892
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,740
the saab argue the thesis six months before it

893
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,499
is reread by the various

894
00:40:23,499 --> 00:40:26,019
academic professors they have reviewed but look that

895
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:28,089
there is your cipher is not full

896
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:30,970
orographic and this in panic in six

897
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,819
months has invented a mega trick

898
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:35,529
cryptographic perish not

899
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:37,150
actually having a chip is the first

900
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,720
cipher they died that creation

901
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,150
another funny thing is that

902
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,920
using quantum technologies you

903
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,869
can do something very similar to the

904
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:51,430
fluorescent morphic grip on then it is called the

905
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,499
e gate blind as a computation

906
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:55,480
delegator  how much a computer and the

907
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,349
concept is very similar but the difference

908
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:01,210
is that with these quantum technologies

909
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:04,630
even computation can be secret

910
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,549
and is linked to the server so the server

911
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:09,839
performs calculations that it does not know what they are

912
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:15,910
so obviously it is similar and is basically solved by

913
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,130
saying in  clear to the

914
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,900
server that data to be able to compute

915
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:25,089
rightly there is a project on pub

916
00:41:25,089 --> 00:41:27,000
that is called

917
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,830
and it is there that it implements these a  The algorithms,

918
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,740
however, are purely academic things

919
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,320
yet the other interesting thing

920
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,510
I wanted to talk about is multi party

921
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,210
computation as the problem to be

922
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:46,080
solved is that of a group of

923
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,620
people

924
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,630
suppose they are millionaires and

925
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,610
want to find out who is the richest person

926
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,550
among them without  reveal how much

927
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,460
money they have this thing is feasible

928
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,530
there are algorithms that allow you to

929
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,510
calculate the maximum of a function

930
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,760
any function on a

931
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,800
distributed set of data without making

932
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,980
all the participants reveal the data

933
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,790
totally is already used in some

934
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,820
countries of northern europe for  example

935
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,570
was used in normandy to try

936
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:21,000
tax evaders two different ministries

937
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,650
sniffed the multi party complication to

938
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,240
find my cottage basically it

939
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,340
was I will stay of education

940
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,460
ministry of finance and this thing

941
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,800
is now in scale it will work we can

942
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,510
make calculations very well

943
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,460
already exist  the first start-ups

944
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,800
dealing with this the latest technology

945
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,870
already I want to talk to you about is the assertion

946
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:47,130
the encryption which is basically very

947
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,140
simple we have a database we

948
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,490
do not want to have the data in our

949
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,890
database but we still want to be able to

950
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:55,530
do sql like queries and we

951
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,860
want whoever does which receives the data is

952
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,920
eventually  in possession of a

953
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,360
symmetric key decrypts the data and if it keeps it

954
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,150
does what it has to do

955
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,320
scenarios the application of you can

956
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,390
imagine a facebook without

957
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,180
facebook being able to have your data

958
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,420
there is a

959
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,859
presentation of the stars and go

960
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,290
the encryption made by the myth is not  more

961
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,630
maintained but they managed to get us on

962
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,900
a forum in php

963
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,260
so this thing is received the taj

964
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,839
mahal voters in my opinion if someone

965
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,150
would like to do it about it can have fun if he

966
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,339
wants to excuse meditating on it could

967
00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:36,670
do it

968
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,349
another thing new to talk about is the idea

969
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:42,230
of compartmentalization which however

970
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,089
rightly you tell me it doesn't work a

971
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:50,630
lot it doesn't work a lot

972
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:54,470
you have to see on which polenta

973
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:58,579
the problem is compacted

974
00:43:58,579 --> 00:43:59,930
compartmentalisation is

975
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,280
mainly given by the fact of how I

976
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,150
manage my bachs and that is if I give

977
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:08,020
bakhit buckets potentially separate databases

978
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,140
with the same people

979
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,119
currently there is no safe way

980
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,150
to make sure that the information

981
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:19,940
I store in a database

982
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,770
they are not fileable in a

983
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:26,180
perennial way and reusable I give you an

984
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,030
example stupid so at least you can understand

985
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:31,210
too

986
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:36,160
so at least I can and let's put it like this

987
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:39,890
until a few years ago the facebook heidi

988
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,960
that is when you had an application

989
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,940
or something like that when you

990
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,670
asked  the id of the facebook user

991
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:49,369
who used your application were

992
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:51,470
totally shared

993
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,690
what does it mean that if I

994
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,260
did the application man down won the

995
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,960
rubber giant ski nawa and you

996
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,839
register as an active user he will give me

997
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,520
his ideas at 0 0  0 79 his was 0 0 0 63

998
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,640
ok if nawa had made

999
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,380
an application with written give a

1000
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,589
huge matte rubber dildo  o and you

1001
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,630


1002
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:22,309
had registered again you would have had again 69 73 this thing

1003
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:25,290
had created had created a market

1004
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:31,470
but a thriving market of realities who

1005
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,860
simply wanted not to retrieve

1006
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,220
your data from facebook then let you

1007
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,270
use an application to get the

1008
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,190
permissions to recover  your

1009
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,960
data and reuse them but much more

1010
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,430
simply that they took your

1011
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,170
facebook ip which is

1012
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,240
found at the time also on the page

1013
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,370
that is they saw you comment somewhere they

1014
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,410
took our facebook has

1015
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,090
idea they went to someone who had the

1016
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,850
database said  give me data and if they

1017
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:03,510
memorized them ok this and this this

1018
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,280
market suddenly ended when

1019
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,760
facebook decided to give the unique

1020
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,070
and different ones for each application

1021
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,130
is unique and which is totally different

1022
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,870
from your iunika id of facebook is no

1023
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,550
longer your facebook heidi  but it's a

1024
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:21,540
heidi now if there is no

1025
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,760
way to get that

1026
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,350
information tied up  to an encryption linked only to

1027
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:32,880
you but you can again put the king

1028
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,890
match in the right ring of the information

1029
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,690
to the market currently on the most

1030
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,980
flourishing network but you do not do it only with

1031
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,540
your navigation

1032
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,580
the reason why facebook bought

1033
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,980
whatsapp is not because it was  a nice

1034
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,860
application with which you

1035
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,290
chatted already had messenger

1036
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:54,150
the goal was only and exclusively to

1037
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,770
have our telephone numbers and to

1038
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,600
have the interrelationships between your

1039
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,390
telephone network numbers and your

1040
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,790
agenda because everyone loaded the agenda

1041
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,160
because it is necessary to use  draft

1042
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,200
was necessary to help therefore the

1043
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,000
fact of having different budgets

1044
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,710
without having an encryption system that

1045
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:13,080
allows me to revoke access to

1046
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,020
my data 2 that avoids

1047
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,480
data caching is absolutely impossible

1048
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,730
which is the real one when we get to the

1049
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,320
real turning point  we will arrive when it is the real

1050
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,630
turning point of the mp that is of that stuff

1051
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:27,090
that in here saves to your data

1052
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,860
that stuff that can then dispense  re the das

1053
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,450
database service filled it it will be you it

1054
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,750
will be you who will authorize or

1055
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,820
revoke access to your data storage

1056
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,130
of purchase intentions against payment

1057
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,520
there is the real turning point we leave

1058
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,390
the other problem of

1059
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,820
compartmentalization that is in my opinion

1060
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,060
that on social networks  network getting different

1061
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,240
accounts for various social groups seems like

1062
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,860
a beautiful idea but in my opinion very

1063
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:59,040
impractical because if you try it

1064
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,800
because cyprus if you try you see that your

1065
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,190
social network does not have

1066
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,960
different social members overlap

1067
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,480
so you may have a

1068
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,610
friend  on a profile which, however, adds more

1069
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,380
and therefore is not something that

1070
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,910
can be clearly separated and therefore it is

1071
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:20,580
also useless in my opinion

1072
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,500
another criticism that can be made to

1073
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,660
this technology is that in any case, even

1074
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:28,110
if the data is encrypted, the meta data remains

1075
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,750
in any case  clear and this is a

1076
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,360
problem still without solution

1077
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,090
it seems to me nothing can be done because

1078
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:38,490
the connection logo when you are

1079
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:42,170
connected  how long the connection lasted

1080
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:46,370
necessarily remains clear

1081
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:58,049
in the meantime on the facebook group of

1082
00:48:58,049 --> 00:49:01,640
baits you will find the links to the slides

1083
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,289
sorry so I did not understand my

1084
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:06,029
unique identifier I have no

1085
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:08,039
possibility to see it because you only need

1086
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:10,140
another right server and in reality you can almost see it

1087
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,999
always because for the reason we

1088
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:15,359
said about caching it is almost always

1089
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,920
placed in a cookie

1090
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,599
but to do what to avoid that

1091
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:21,720
every time they have to recover it

1092
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,460
unfortunately often and willingly you

1093
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,910
do not have the unique true id never an

1094
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:29,309
encrypted version quarrels of unique this because

1095
00:49:29,309 --> 00:49:31,200
why  it is a few really

1096
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,210
parade people that is those who make

1097
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,380
parasites and a system of this type

1098
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,390
are people with wonderful colors underneath

1099
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,309
had made a series of

1100
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:42,660
decidedly malevolent writings that

1101
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,700
went to capture the

1102
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,029
profiling cookies and recover him unica.it

1103
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:50,880
therefore for  avoid this every almost

1104
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,220
every player working inside

1105
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,920
a mp has its own key and

1106
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,989
calls them  and servers on past servers with the

1107
00:49:57,989 --> 00:49:59,640
key to make sure that it

1108
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,619
is encrypted and that it does not have a reply

1109
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:03,809
again cross and it is exactly the

1110
00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:05,369
same thing that facebook did so

1111
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,440
anyway it becomes difficult for

1112
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,269
me to go to my boss's browser to

1113
00:50:09,269 --> 00:50:12,390
take it  the exact and are able to pay or

1114
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,460
pay also because normally in a

1115
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,279
case of rais inc if they use

1116
00:50:17,279 --> 00:50:19,229
something related to the audio or

1117
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:22,049
the mouse movements or the light you do not have the

1118
00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:23,969
same thing and therefore at some point there

1119
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:25,769
will be  a dyscrasia you can do it until the

1120
00:50:25,769 --> 00:50:27,420
last racing until the next racing

1121
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,729
when you have syncardia mind there is

1122
00:50:29,729 --> 00:50:31,650
a dyscrasia of some kind is the

1123
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:33,410
reason why among other things

1124
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:36,930
some propositions are said it seems to me

1125
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:39,359
not blue that the but of other providers you

1126
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,119
they say that they recognize users who

1127
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:48,109
use certain flat devices the patterns

1128
00:50:48,109 --> 00:50:51,479
I wanted to make a consideration, however, only

1129
00:50:51,479 --> 00:50:54,180
on the fact of being able to do this thing

1130
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,640
here, that is, to be able to revoke,

1131
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,000
let's say, one's own identity or  to be able to

1132
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,349
determine one of the expiration date

1133
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,960
let's say in this case I think

1134
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,609
the services will talk to us in the sense that

1135
00:51:05,609 --> 00:51:08,069
now we are the goods that they

1136
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:11,819
give us the facebook service all

1137
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,369
you want because in any case we

1138
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:16,500
make money and through us their

1139
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,210
opinions of the  money when

1140
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:21,779
we could revoke

1141
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:24,029
their possibility to use these data in December

1142
00:51:24,029 --> 00:51:25,769
they no longer have reason to end

1143
00:51:25,769 --> 00:51:28,170
those services exactly but in fact the

1144
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,660
game is not to recall it and still use

1145
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,400
scores with [ __ ]

1146
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,710
the game here is another game and to say

1147
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:38,099
I want to be in charge that is the agreements it

1148
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:39,809
is I who must give mine from

1149
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:42,359
my mp to another already there are systems that

1150
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:45,140
are trying to create a digital

1151
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:48,059
fingerprint knows that I can share

1152
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,450
and I give you this as a payment but

1153
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:53,849
participating in all that  which is also

1154
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:55,170
the part of the revenue stream at the

1155
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:57,059
moment we have, however, nothing else is to be talked about

1156
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:58,980
the market is drugged

1157
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,359
because in reality the king is the revenue that

1158
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,940
those who sell advertising do on the single

1159
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,490
user are orders of magnitude

1160
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,859
higher than what

1161
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:13,049
the user actually perceives so you have a

1162
00:52:13,049 --> 00:52:16,849
service that costs p nuts and that makes

1163
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:21,180
billions ok and above all if you then think

1164
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,579
about a survival income it does not call

1165
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:25,440
something of citizenship  of another

1166
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,799
type to a path in which in reality

1167
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:33,420
your power to be able to create work create

1168
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:37,259
income by working is extremely low and

1169
00:52:37,259 --> 00:52:39,839
tends to disappear but in reality you

1170
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,369
become the fundamental bridge because

1171
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:44,099
as a spender of that income without

1172
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:46,319
you the whole quaternary market

1173
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,779
advanced even more tertiary this

1174
00:52:48,779 --> 00:52:50,510
never quaternary advance

1175
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:53,750
works the gap between how much you pay for

1176
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,730
a service and how much they earn and

1177
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:57,050
that thing that would even allow you to

1178
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,510
recreate a sort of fair

1179
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,880
where among children digital citizenship income

1180
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,220


1181
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:07,940
if you receive it partly due to the

1182

fact  to give your data is actually

1183
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,900
set a consistent monetary value was recognized

1184
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,090
among various  player

1185
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:16,400
you would not have team has a single player who

1186
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,540
