1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,419
good evening everyone my name is tirano and

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,580
the first time i arrive at esc it

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,960
is a great satisfaction for me to arrive

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,509
here i work as mattia in digital

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,070
forensics and tonight i present

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,930
something about android i also

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,310
like iphone and us  let's have fun and mattia

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,289
pass us the various information on these

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,960
wonderful devices because beyond

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,520
the aesthetic part of the price

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,010
they actually have behind them there is a

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,590
lot of gini what we will look at

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,899
tonight will be the physical dow of an

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,300
android device one of the few things

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,910
that it will still be possible to believe in

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,340
these years because even this possibility will disappear

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,800


18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
the topic of this evening divided

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,699
into different parts or some time they

20
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,000
said so we will look at two types of

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,129
interesting devices on the market

22
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,449
we have the samsung which are mobile

23
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,049
phones  a little more distributed

24
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,299
within the

25
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,939
android and immediate operating system I chose the

26
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,869
tech media which are the microprocessors that are

27
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,869
found  we are in all mobile phones that

28
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,549
basically come from China

29
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,490
famous Chinese phones because the

30
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,729
mediatek gives the possibility to understand

31
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,170
what it means to do physical damage

32
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,740
so I took an example of the structure

33
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,619
of the memory of the technical media so

34
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,150
we can better understand what we are

35
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,729
going to go  then to do later on the

36
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:45,270
samsung we will install a let's say admissions

37
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,000
which is nothing more than a mini

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,369
operating system loaded in memory that will

39
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,280
allow us to do the physical dump of the

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,540
device

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,579
then the question is why I have to do

42
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,490
physical damage in the context of digital

43
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,250
forensics often and  willingly and

44
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,229
a magistrate arrives he calls you you go to his

45
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,610
desk he tells you this is a

46
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,179
telephone do

47
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,459
me a courtesy he extracts all the

48
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,260
information that is inside

49
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,720
you ask me what he says

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,129
anything that can be useful so

51
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:21,209
practically everything and do in  so that

52
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:22,860
this operation here does not

53
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,409
alter the content link of the

54
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:28,079
information there de  ntro that saying

55
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,579
this seems like a very

56
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:33,000
simple thing in reality it is quite complicated

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,799
because once you decide to

58
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:36,959
turn on the phone from that moment

59
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,540
onwards you are modifying

60
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,609
its content it

61
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:42,720
may be that you are making a

62
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,299
change to an irrelevant information

63
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,799
for the  'investigation but in any case it is

64
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,709
carrying out a modification of the content

65
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:50,970
then from what we invented

66
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,609
in the field of digital forensics

67
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:55,980
we invented the physical dump on these

68
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,950
devices for some you can still

69
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,940
make a physical acquisition or you

70
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,690
can simulate that the mobile phone becomes

71
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,650
a  computer and you start from a cd rom

72
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,709
which is basically nothing more than a

73
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,359
piece of program you start memory and

74
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,599
from that you run a couple that you can

75
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,489
go to write or inside an sd

76
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:26,310
card on the phone or you can

77
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,949
listen to it directly on the pc by connecting

78
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:31,739
the mobile phone has a PC having first

79
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,049
installed some software some

80
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,239
software from the developer suite of

81
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,699
a  ndroid we basically tonight

82
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,560
we will see this is all we are

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,169
going to say now that is if it is

84
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:54,060
possible to have the mood of the device

85
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,250
not locked

86
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,069
what it means and

87
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,680
android operating system works a bit like a pc from a

88
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,769
certain point of view and there is a  module of

89
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,230
which starts and then starts the kernel which makes

90
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,449
its various modules and

91
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,510
starts a graphical interface

92
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,599
here is the bootloader in the case in which in

93
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,250
our case tonight it is a bootloader

94
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,440
that we can manipulate that is we

95
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,849
can tell them not to start  the

96
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,919
operating system but to start another

97
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,320
thing called recovery because because

98
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,120
inside your phone there is

99
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,550
an area of memory that is destined for

100
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,740
the android operating system and then they

101
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,590
thought of putting another

102
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,660
another piece of  area where you

103
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,700
get inside the so-called poor man

104
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,350
that is a start of the device that

105
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,600
allows you to do some operations

106
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,480
usually by default allows you to reset

107
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,570
the phone  well if I am an

108
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,390
aspect of forensics I can inject

109
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,700
on that partition apart from a

110
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,800
recovery which then allows me to

111
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,140
copy the phone as if it were a

112
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,690
hard disk, it got the result I

113
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,310
wanted

114
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,590
ok so we

115
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,200
assume that we have a  bootloader with which I can

116
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,710
tell him my friend not to start the

117
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,480
operating system but via this information

118
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,340
this piece of code which is

119
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,260
called recovery

120
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,970
in our case the tools we will see

121
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,550
this evening are for media tech

122
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,240
we have the famous flash tools which is a

123
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,370
trivial little program is  instead for the

124
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,310
samsung or ding we must of course

125
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,780
inject a recovery that allows us

126
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,940
to do what we want and then

127
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,130
we must look for something

128
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,480
specific for that model that

129
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,640
usually fortunately some developer creates and

130
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,160
makes available we certainly do not go to

131
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,100
buy the problem of the

132
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,680
locked bootloader was born with with

133
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,900
the release of lollipop

134
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,270
thereafter in your android phone

135
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,440
you can decide whether to have the bootloader

136
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,630
locked less because someone has decided

137
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,540
to do this thing here for a simple

138
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,750
reason if we owe his

139
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,320
android phone to mattia and he

140
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,650
naturally put a code on us when

141
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,240
we wash ourselves we find the lock code

142
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,070
but if mattia has not blocked  his

143
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,220
bootloader

144
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,420
I can take care of another

145
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,490
code that is put inside the

146
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,350
fittings partition I start

147
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,060
with the recovery partition from that

148
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,980
moment I have complete control of

149
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,270
the

150
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,680
positive disk and I do nothing but

151
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,460
install over the  his mobile phone

152
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,650
possibly my operating system

153
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,000
I lose the data that is contained

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,190
inside but who cares in the

155
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,630
meantime I have the usable phone again

156
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,100
ok what they have placed

157
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,650
we make sure that if someone wants to

158
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,390
be smart and steals your mobile phone

159
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,270
he still can't reset it because

160
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,250
because he can't start anything

161
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,080
from the admissions partition ok

162
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
the question is but how do I do it  I

163
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,170
human being to understand if my mobile phone to

164
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,620
boot the bootloader locked or not

165
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,140
then the simplest thing to do one

166
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,170
enters the options the developer

167
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,580
in the advanced options goes to see if

168
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,130
bourlot locked or not or does a

169
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,260
very stupid thing to via the  mobile phone

170
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,580
in recovery you immediately realize in the

171
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,530
cover usually the forensic expert

172
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,700
immediately realizes that this is a recovery

173
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,750
stock there is an original recovery and goes without

174
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,770
general admissions goes to see

175
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,870
if it is written if the

176
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,300
bootloader blocked or not or  on

177
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,850
some models of phones says other

178
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,560
telephone operators you can visit

179
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,600
this code and you will get

180
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,280
information that tells you whether

181
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,140
your bootloader has actually

182
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,720
been leased or not clearly

183
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,000
the forensic expert what does the

184
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,760
forese expert do if he does both the mobile phone cannot

185
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,490
turn it on enter the code and go

186
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,020
inside to look because he has already tampered with

187
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,170
the phone the forensic expert what he does he

188
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,200
does it starts with recovery

189
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,910
hoping that it is a cover in an

190
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,630
original

191
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,160
so I have already done halfway through the work

192
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,680
or in the original cover selca

193
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,360
you have to understand if there is actually

194
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,590
an information that says if the

195
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,590
bootloader is blocked or not if the

196
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,570
recovery starts and there is no  absolutely nothing written

197
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,410


198
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,490
and very likely that your

199
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,460
bootloader is free so it is not

200
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,340
leased otherwise it is allocated it

201
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,150
tells you question is it is perched what

202
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,770
I do

203
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,040
then in 2012 the bike goes there who was the

204
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,150
first to send out

205
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,710
their own passion  of

206
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,100
android with the bootloader locked had

207
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,170
a simple a holy if mechanism

208
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,380
whereby according to the heidi device that is a

209
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,210
unique identifier of that

210
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,640
device that she loves a code that is

211
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,830
unique by throwing in something if

212
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,670
the boom was unlocked the oreal what

213
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,080
happened is  happened that someone

214
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,640
found the algorithm to be able to

215
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,310
identify this key from device 6

216
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,170
and sold it on the web

217
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,030
so what did you do you had a

218
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,330
perfect motorola did it  start in

219
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,720
a mode that allows you to talk to

220
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,720
the bootloader because the bootloader can

221
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,700
interact with

222
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,970
the human being in quotation marks it is called fast boot

223
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,760
asks him a question a very

224
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,980
sexy request there you ask the device and whose is

225
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,410
this is recovered  the device and you

226
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,330
went to a website that for a

227
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,370
fee set up the code and made you

228
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,700
unlock it elevate bourlot unlocked

229
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,410
or in some models very

230
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,120
simply you went to give a

231
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,840
very stupid command saying ok

232
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,240
bootloader unlocked type

233
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,070
open sesame and  some were unlocked

234
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,260
things have changed a bit now they are

235
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,390
all that the bootloader is

236
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,700
blocked you cannot recover with this

237
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,350
mechanism but you need to

238
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,280
find a bug to be able to unlock

239
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,860
at least album notes perfect the expert

240
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,830
sentence what does it does not have time to stall aa

241
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,220
look for the desks or ask some friends

242
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,010
if any ideas or take the

243
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,400
wallet no go to a site maybe

244
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,440
someone who recommended a friend and yes  buy

245
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,260
a beautiful black box substantially

246
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,690
of the boxes this one here the

247
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,110
box of the athlete 3x that supports

248
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,830
an avalanche of android is a small

249
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,560
connected box that is connected

250
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,710
to the mobile

251
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,170
phone which allows you to lock

252
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,760
that specific model of the mobile phone

253
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,240
what  ago uses only a

254
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,610
bug of that specific mobile phone model

255
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,300
to be able to

256
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,130
take possession and unlock the bootloader ok

257
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,890
and I personally have never tried it on the

258
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,920
s6 a colleague has used this

259
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,000
person this version of the box and

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,280
it worked perfectly the cost they

261
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,350
sell you the  box and then they give you

262
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,930
a separate subscription that every year you go

263
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,180
to rino worth 300 euros

264
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,610
here is 300 euros for a forensic expert

265
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,170
to do this thing here is a figure

266
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:34,010
that goes very very well ok so if

267
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,610
you have a bulldozer that is

268
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,760
desperately stuck  you can safely go

269
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,550
in search of a software in the

270
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,780
internet on the net if they are

271
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,610
ok perfect  or so I don't have this

272
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,090
problem

273
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,250
tonight we have a bully who

274
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,170
can make him do what I

275
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,150
want what we need a computer

276
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,460
in any type of computer where you

277
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,870
install the

278
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,870
developer tools for android sdk you don't need

279
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,570
to download the whole world  all the

280
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,730
package the developer only to the

281
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,360
sdk in particular you have to install

282
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,500
these these are let's say accessories

283
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,530
if you only install these without

284
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,620
having to install the whole suite

285
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,210
go and use

286
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,950
only what you need

287
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,950
after which this is the tool that

288
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:35,410
allows you to talk to the bootloader  and

289
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,850
then with the recovery

290
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,040
ok so this here is installed

291
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,650
in the pc and allows you to talk to the

292
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,410
mobile phone then you have to have the

293
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,360
mobile phone drivers if you use a mediatek you have to

294
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,190
use certain media

295
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,350
tech drivers if you have a samsung 20 st darus

296
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,310
the samsung drives

297
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,470
there is little to do after which you need the

298
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,220
tool to be able to flash in

299
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,529
commas  ette that famous piece of

300
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,450
memory which is called let's say recovery

301
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,350
no and for samsung we have either in or

302
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,200
version 3 now while for the tech media

303
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,460


304
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,180
we have the flashes on all this

305
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,110
naturally free which for the

306
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,150
foreseen expert is always a big help

307
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,470
this and i  added these slides in the

308
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,850
sense that if someone wants to try to

309
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,209
do it at home, here you know the packages

310
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,660
they have to use and how

311
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,160
to configure to be able

312
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,209
to automatically call the adb term

313
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:38,529
after which once you launch

314
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:40,779
these flash tools these audiences will

315
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,730
such a mask appears this

316
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,220
mask is very important because seen in this

317
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,250
way it says very little

318
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,750
one of the characteristics that

319
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,920
media techs have is that they do not know how

320
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,500
this

321
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,410
flash tour tool is structured

322
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,880


323
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,190
several phones that mount

324
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,590
these types of microprocessors so

325
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,080
you have to give a diagram of how

326
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,080
the internal memory is made  of the mobile phone

327
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,410
or you have to tell them then in your

328
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,340
memory a piece is dedicated to

329
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,260
your user given a piece there is the boom

330
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,660
a piece there are the files that

331
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,850
identify how the

332
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,100
partitions of the mobile phone are built another

333
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,020
piece there is the image  of the operating system

334
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,650


335
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,260
here is this information here are

336
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,910
contained within a file

337
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,080
called scatter file each each mobile phone

338
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,510
and each version of that mobile phone to

339
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,580
the specific one snaps to the file so

340
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,040
the first thing you want you have to do

341
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,710
if you have to go to put the  mani have

342
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,320
been defined mediatek only for the media

343
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,020
the you have to go and get an

344
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,150
original rom because inside the

345
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,610
original rom there is this famous scatter file

346
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,890
that once you go to

347
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,660
magically load it shows you how

348
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,910
the memory is made up of the memory  physics

349
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:11,720
inside your mediatek what's there

350
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,200
is a part used for the cache

351
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,060
so there is a chunk of memory used for

352
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,070
the cache a chunk for i

353
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,770
user data which basically said in a

354
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,170
nutshell is the only piece that

355
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,060
interests me there are other formations

356
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,310
here for example there is in the boot image

357
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,360
there are structures br 1 to br

358
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,740
2 that go to tell android how it is

359
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,920
constituted the various petitions

360
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,290
inside it by modifying for example these

361
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,440
files it is possible to modify the space

362
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,540
of the user data that is to increase the

363
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,720
user space inside the phone there is to

364
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,770
indulge oneself so the other thing you

365
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,570
have to do if you have to put your hand on the

366
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,240
half notch  have an original rom the

367
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,340
original firmware of your

368
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,920
phone and it is of course downloadable and

369
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,120
free on samsung on order and very

370
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,980
instead everything very simple there is

371
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,750
nothing complicated there is only a

372
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,480
beautiful interface with four beautiful

373
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,610
buttons

374
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,710
that change every year change the

375
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,750
give a different name and you just have to

376
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,940
try to understand which is the

377
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,100
right big button to be able to do the operation that

378
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,130
interests you then inside the

379
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,920
your phone there is not only the

380
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,750
firmware seen as the operating system

381
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,550
there are also other firmware that is

382
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,500
the telephone part the telephone part the

383
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,570
one that actually ball with the

384
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,810
cell to a film aside ok and is in a separate

385
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,620
point which is basically  the

386
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,720
baseband so this here a piece of

387
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,430
information is a film that you are not

388
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,650
interested in going to modify even the

389
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,570
bully of you are interested in going to

390
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,790
modify and not even some information

391
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,300
of the provider that sometimes the phones are

392
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,540
branded is that the provider writes

393
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,280
in the information  what

394
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,500
are its apn here is also that one

395
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,329
thing that you are not interested in, you are

396
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,190
interested only in the key

397
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,670
called p prints the application and there where it

398
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,790
is inserted into your

399
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,339
android operating system and there where it is

400
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,199
inserted into the recovery then of

401
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,939
all these beautiful most holy men that you

402
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,439
have remember that you have to use

403
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,700
the button ap ok that the part we say

404
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,710
more interesting once you ch  and you have

405
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,160
uploaded this then you are in place

406
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,570
where this information can

407
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,490
be pulled out directly from

408
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,110
your mobile phone just to get

409
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,180
an idea going to want this

410
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,420
code substantially this here you

411
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,820
from the bild in the android version that

412
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,770
you have inside giving

413
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,040
information substantially for  what

414
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,600
we have to do or from you do not

415
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,430
need it absolutely

416
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:01,280
ok then a last feature of

417
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,570
the mediatek dl drivers if you do not install

418
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,990
the mediatek drives you cannot

419
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,940
medicine hand a feature of

420
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,880
these drivers is that the phone is

421
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,740
recognized when it is turned off that is you

422
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,580
turn off  the mobile phone you attach it to the

423
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,430
computer with the mobile phone off luis cruz

424
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,560
that whoever is connected to the mediatek and

425
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,650
tells you about the view of the devices that

426
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,890
hear the media

427
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,900
so if you connect it to the phone

428
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,550
off it fights away disconnected and this does not

429
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,010
appear from the management of your

430
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,760
devices

431
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,560
you have not installed the

432
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,510
ve drivers correctly  I say this because often and

433
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,920
willingly if he stays there to understand

434
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,510
why the flash shift recognizes this

435
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,370
mobile phone because the drivers are not

436
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,230
perfectly connected

437
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,930
done this we begin to do the forensics

438
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,580
then the forhans where false

439
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,860
physical condition because because he has little time to

440
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,790
do and must e  must bring out these data

441
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,120
then what do I do before I

442
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,970
go crazy trying to put in

443
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,370
a recovery no I go to see that the

444
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,770
covers me because maybe this here at the

445
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,240
geek in quotes and but already

446
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,490
stuffed into the things that

447
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,170
interest me then what

448
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,300
start the phone in recovery mode

449
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,390
there are key combinations that

450
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,670
you can take on the phone

451
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,810
and start the phone with this

452
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,120
recovery mode

453
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,860
once the phone and recovery

454
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,740
you have to talk to this recovery

455
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,280
do not speak having installed on your

456
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,220
computer the famous sdk lando sdk of

457
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,100
first no you start them a

458
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,160
daemon called divi that consent  and to

459
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,820
send commands to the adb device works

460
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,460
very well and allows you to have a

461
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,800
list of the devices that are connected

462
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,010
with a very simple command after which

463
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,240
you try to do things if if the

464
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,160
recovery is a stock recovery

465
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,410
already in things like  original has so

466
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,240
it is commanded that you try to give me vida

467
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,060
spades of the series you are not authorized to

468
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,590
do absolutely nothing

469
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,690
and it tells you unauthorized access or

470
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,510
does not answer you even in this case

471
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,430
here you have found yourself with the recovery that

472
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,710
does not allow me to do anything that  what

473
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,690
you have to do you have

474
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,970
to put inside one the proofs of

475
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,050
you the bolt must be unlocked and

476
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,080
you have to waste some time looking

477
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,470
for that specific model of phone

478
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,840
the recovery covetta if you put inside

479
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,490
another recovery that has absolutely nothing to do with it, do

480
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,880
not destroy

481
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,440
apparently nothing in the sense

482
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,429
you have however modified the tel

483
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:44,980
then from the forensic point of view you have

484
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,840
made a modification of the telephone  no you

485
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,289
have not changed the data you have made

486
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:52,509
a change you have entered some

487
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:53,409
code that has absolutely

488
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:55,330
nothing to do with it is not a problem in reality the

489
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,820
phone does not start you do not say

490
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,970
now the phone is unusable but

491
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,570
you are interested in doing the  activity so

492
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,129
you absolutely have to find the recovery

493
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:08,230
that is right for you

494
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,809
and then you have to

495
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:12,220
strike a bit in quotes to look for this type

496
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,240
of recovery

497
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,399
let's pretend that we have found

498
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,200
this region no

499
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,850
perfect then I am part of my

500
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,769
flash on why now I go  on the

501
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:23,740
mediatek I shoot on the shots to the file of

502
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,539
that specific model then I

503
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:28,389
downloaded from yes from any site

504
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:30,580
of my manufacturer that specific

505
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,840
model i the latest version of the firmware

506
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,799
or the fad

507
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,629
the scatter file that told me how

508
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,970
the internal structure is made

509
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,619
of my memory

510
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:43,690
well then what am I going to do

511
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,490
in the internal structure there is precisely

512
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,980
an area of memory where there is already the

513
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,230
recovery of tip  or stock that is from the

514
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,419
perfect original cover then what

515
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:54,309
I do from the programs I do is

516
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:58,240
load my recovery so

517
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,460
I do nothing but remove all the flags

518
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,259
except this is load me from the

519
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:04,179
covers of this here is a particular

520
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:07,389
type of very well known recovery that

521
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:08,980
the one that allows me to do

522
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,009
certain operations once

523
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:14,529
I have found it what I do like a

524
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:17,259
sheep I press download and

525
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:18,970
wait until this green cosentino appears from me

526
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,490
when this positive

527
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,639
and defined all less than 10 seconds

528
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:26,710
ok at this point  what have you done have you

529
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,200
stuffed into the code

530
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,820
hoping that it is the right one

531
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,730
inside this phone well

532
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,899
what do I

533
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:37,240
do impose the recovery mode

534
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,070
once the recovery mode has started

535
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,279
what do I do from an

536
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,590
adb device command and luisa kroll yes

537
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,269
actually  something is attached

538
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:49,179
that tells you perfect cover now from

539
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:51,119
another command to see if a shell

540
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,549
gives a d  i michelle and I realize that it has

541
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:55,100
a nice

542
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,679
maximum a beautiful koman of everything

543
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,700
perfect if you are root

544
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,039
you have already finished and I can half of your

545
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:07,820
work you have loaded a memory that

546
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,220
allows you to have ev at this point

547
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,150
what you do

548
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,679
give the command mount to see

549
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:14,720
what has been mounted automatically the

550
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,260
recovery

551
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,539
so it makes you understand if

552
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:19,370
the user partition is actually also mounted

553
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,990
because the one that must be preserved a bit

554
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,030
that it was better not to mount

555
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,340
ok

556
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,309
but you have to understand for a moment how

557
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:31,280
the memory structure is built inside

558
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,080
no  because you want to

559
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,260
dump only that particular

560
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,330
partition because you in the

561
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,850
essex deal while one at

562
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,200
a time we worked a lot like

563
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,860
sheep no then there are 500 five hundred

564
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,150
disks to take away what we do

565
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,850
we take away the storage

566
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:53,390
now no  there is a storage of 70 earth

567
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,010
what I need

568
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,750
I need here perfect data you

569
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,730
arrive there and you go to take only

570
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,870
exclusively that  llo what you need

571
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,480
then the idea cole you take away

572
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,960
only the partition with the user data will

573
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,580
position users you have to understand where

574
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,190
no information is written

575
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,200
inside a file that is called by a searching

576
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,230
scorer info and basically in the file he

577
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,490
told you that  the block called mmc block 0

578
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:25,070
p 7 this k0 mmc blk 0 and all the

579
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,870
memory this let's say is the slice

580
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,020
number 7 is quite standard in the media

581
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,510
tech is absolutely what you need

582
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,320
to take away

583
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,549
good perfect what I do I can

584
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:39,590
use this technique I thread  inside an

585
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,630
sdk

586
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:46,960
sorry a microsd sd card well the

587
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,330
recovery no since it conceals installed

588
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,669
allows me to do certain things

589
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:55,760
also allows me the recovery to mount the

590
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,340
hot seats that I just do not film

591
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,370
given inside so if you want I gave the

592
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,990
command directly from the line  shell command command

593
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,190


594
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,809
or you can safely use

595
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:08,630
the coveri that allows you to join

596
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,480
joe cavallar and a little bit and to

597
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,850
mount your sd card once  ta that

598
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,070
you have mounted from sb heat the command

599
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,430
a trivial di evin done the

600
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:24,740
physical dump of the partition of the slice 7

601
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,990
directly inside the file in the

602
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:32,260
sd card this is one of the countless

603
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,670
possibilities to use if instead

604
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:42,290
we work with our friend samsung

605
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,170
things  they are much simpler but so

606
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,780
simple even more

607
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,890
substantially you only have to recover

608
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,340
only the recovery and load it

609
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,530
in this very stupid little program and

610
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,330
press the help start button and then

611
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,520
wait in the meantime wait for the

612
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,440
mobile phone with shovels a whole series of

613
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,120
information basically tell him

614
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,040
for the  'love of god does not extinguish years because

615
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,070
now you could make a mess and nothing else

616
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,870
but that then restarts a

617
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,170
recovery tonight a tivù tv lp

618
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,480
that shows you socially this

619
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,920
screen if you beat the

620
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,840
poor people this screen appears you have

621
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,020
in your hand  the power of the world you can do

622
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,920
anything you want

623
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,200
a very nice thing can happen

624
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,920
connect this deal here this

625
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,310
deal with this recovery to

626
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,380
your pc and it could happen that it

627
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,480
does not accept adb commands that is it does not accept

628
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,490
any type of shell command

629
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,290
and it still happens in certain types of

630
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:53,420
mobile phones that you download it

631
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,910
admissions that you are interested in and it does not work

632
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,630
from db so you can't give commands

633
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:02,690
via shell or my god

634
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,200
and now what do we do nothing and do a

635
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,900
very simple thing insert into an

636
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,830
sd card

637
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,230
these the cover of anna the beauty of

638
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,960
also having a shell where you can

639
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,450
safely send commands

640
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,520
written directly  that the things of

641
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,770
then do nothing but has

642
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,840
a shell put them they launch

643
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,150
your beautiful command who you have

644
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:30,860
previously tested that there is always

645
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,930
the risk of making a papocchio maybe

646
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,300
I go to write where I should not write and

647
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,640
that case you dump me directly

648
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,250
on the  citycar using the terminal

649
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,630
of the le cori or if you have I

650
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,610
use a lot of ubuntu hicks to be able to

651
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,500
launch q  his command if the db

652
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,820
works

653
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,640
you can do a b and a b pool

654
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,490
or to suck all the memory not

655
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,950
just the slice using this

656
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,740
command directly from your pc

657
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,740
in the sense that you put in connect

658
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,740
the phone in recovery to your

659
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,400
computer

660
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,870
I prefer to always use  my

661
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:12,320
xubuntu launched this question is he but

662
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,690
up to bunches a machine grinds in the 6

663
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,410
7 8 15 16 24 48 32 hours

664
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:22,280
the wallet 8 16 24

665
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:29,270
124 no 32 and 64 gb of data which then for

666
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,150
the forensic expert this is the first step

667
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:37,100
because then the data must be put

668
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,020
under parsing because I have to pull

669
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,210
out all the information and

670
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,170
once I have pulled out all the

671
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,670
information I have to understand what I

672
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,020
was looking for

673
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,030
and you think it's over here no the

674
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,500
catch is that I have to do a  relationship

675
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,450
and it did not end like this because after I

676
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,430
made a relationship and I got

677
00:28:55,430 --> 00:29:00,380
paid shortly after 23 years they tell you that

678
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,630
a Filipino comes home who told

679
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,910
you you have to go you have to give  in front of a

680
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,060
judge to make that you paid me

681
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,190
you fixed everything for me you have to go and

682
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,300
explain what you did

683
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,810
but he did it three years ago things

684
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,030
have changed the programs have changed

685
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,640
no yes in fact in the technical report

686
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,320
you have written all the programs that

687
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,660
you used at that time no because if

688
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,580
not someone challenges you but now you can

689
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,030
do this and you go there in front of the

690
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,860
judge no you are experts in

691
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,120
professionals

692
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,430
you find people who do anything

693
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,190
but weigh what you say

694
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,890
so if you say something that  I think that

695
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:50,870
's how he gets killed and you have to report

696
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,420
what you said and if you say

697
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,640
something that isn't written in the

698
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,680
report you have someone

699
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,210
shooting at you says drama she didn't

700
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,559
write it which one didn't write it but then

701
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,610
if she didn't  he wrote it means that he did

702
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,610
not think so the moral of the story

703
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,400
I extended the broth as much as I could

704
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,400
because the talk was 18 minutes but

705
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,260
he told me to do a little more

706
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,630
substance  almente I showed him with a

707
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,750
few slides and the work it

708
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,900
takes takes 4 6 hours and it costs work here

709
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,410
but in short it was quite feasible

710
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,030
I do not know how much you understand if you have

711
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:34,550
any questions he does not he did

712
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,260
not think about the commercial side  see

713
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:47,080
all paula case it is perhaps impossible

714
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,370
lollipop bootloader with password tried

715
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,820
or the flash tool to reflect the

716
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,300
firmware

717
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,350
obviously says of mila password

718
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,960
mobile phone without sd card

719
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,350
there is a great one with non-

720
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,690
detachable battery well I would say that it is perfect so

721
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,780
in this and in this case  here is home

722
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,100
i 4 c

723
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,140
mounts a medium t and this is true but

724
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:33,480
then unfortunately flash with the problem

725
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,750
of you tried with flash on to try

726
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,510
to load on fresh to see if it

727
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,340
will be able to do a dump of the partitions it

728
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,720
is to be seen for a moment that passion of

729
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,310
facebook because with the samsung you have to start

730
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:53,600
the mood mode and he tells you

731
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,740
look blocked so do

732
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,660
absolutely nothing then you dream after

733
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,940
I have worked I no I have played in

734
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,490
actually not part of the bootloader

735
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,860
when you insert the tool in

736
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,360
you must not absolutely start the

737
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,740
bully from the just enough that it is

738
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,940
connected to the usb port

739
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,190
you can safely flash it and

740
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,950
talk to it inside from the covers you could

741
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,770
think of shooting it inside even a

742
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,800
bully of the modified because  because

743
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,180
when you are part of the covers to

744
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,340
start the bully the original and if he

745
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,320
asks you for the password it means

746
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,090
that you have to change that gentleman there too

747
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,700
no so it would be necessary to recover a

748
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,190
modified bootloader that does not

749
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,690
ask you for the password no

750
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,860
you could try to do a  thing

751
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,930
like that if the change is written

752
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,370
inside the bootloader buy an

753
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,760
identical phone and dump

754
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,910
that the dump you can do by starting with

755
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,400
the current coveri and only dump

756
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,680
the bootloader partition then

757
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,900
type cheer the bootloader and then  always

758
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,520
with his studies you throw into the

759
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,500
bootloader hoping that the password request is

760
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,850
actually written  and

761
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,320
inside the bollate

762
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,800
otherwise we often and gladly

763
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,240
say miracles like this we are not yet

764
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,070
equipped and then we always say for

765
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,780
what you pay us it's okay so

766
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:16,370
in short ok here I say it and here I deny it

767
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,630
because actually I do not remember but

768
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,710
mediatek I think we can  dame seems

769
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,300
directly from the flash on without

770
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,559
even starting the bootloader so

771
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,899
you from the serial depends on the commitment

772
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:30,730
of the version in what I saw I

773
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,499
did not succeed I tell you without the

774
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:33,789
truth but it depends on the version of the

775
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:42,070
fresh I tried with a tool  low

776
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,059
level to do the dump and it came out

777
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:51,429
inter password and on the site they said you have to

778
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:54,909
send to xiaomi ceriale

779
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:57,490
the model of the phone to their team to

780
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,879
send a sms however the

781
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:04,269
perfect password then place has trained

782
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:05,830
bolca round but the important in the end

783
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,159
as it says  as Mattias also says,

784
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,139
the important thing in our

785
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,730
profession is three bills and reaching

786
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:13,480
a conclusion

787
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,579
the conclusion is to take the investigation  ato give him

788
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:17,079
the face of a beating help from the

789
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,449
password is fine the same because

790
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:21,099
in the end we must have a

791
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:22,690
result which is to present an

792
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,609
elaborate no that we take discuss after

793
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:25,300
23 years

794
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,918
but actually the important thing is

795
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:28,899
that therefore the con

796
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:35,319
manual winner xvi but it is not enough

797
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:41,139
just do not say it we do not report it in the

798
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,560


799
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:00,740
consultancy ok bye guys thanks
