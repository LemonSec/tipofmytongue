1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,669
all the Monday morning warriors returns

2
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:09,710
today we are talking about the fact that

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,660
software programs hardware maybe

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,360
we have a little too much for what

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,060
we have to do

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,539
consider that whatever I say

7
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,150
about what you will see will

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,680
mainly concern the consumer market

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,820
so we are not talking  of

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,170
workstations we are talking about

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,130
what my mother uses to go on facebook

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,770
unfortunately for those who do not know them they are

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,920
work platforms I am a developer

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,239
in the web field or comparison founded

15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,469
together am the mestre a club I

16
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,210
consider myself a supporter of

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,559
free software and I volunteer for  mozilla

18
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,550
how about on the mobile developer network that

19
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,500
a wiki for web development documentation we

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,660


21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,119
start with this sexyssima photo by

22
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,400
william henry gates iii otherwise known

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,060
as bill who in 1981 said that 640k

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,140
should have been enough for everyone

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,570
obviously we are not so radical

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,820
we know that 640k al  nowadays they are not

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,020
even enough to start the

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:28,860
computer  I receive, however, this is except

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,170
conspiracy theories and anything else the computer

30
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,490
that brought man to the moon

31
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,619
that point you see on the

32
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,570
clock frequency on the cpu and a decimal point

33
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,369
is not a divider of thousands are

34
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,990
two mega hertz this computer was running

35
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,610
precisely  with this processor at 2 mega

36
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,780
hertz 4096 bytes of ram and 64k of rom

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,700
the program was you the program

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,479
that made the chicken fly was in 64

39
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,009
kb code total cost estimated

40
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:00,390
on the order of billions of dollars for

41
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,799
the record of tools for everything  the

42
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,720
program

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,350
for the realization of this computer let's

44
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,210
compare it now with the average computer

45
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,810
of a year ago which is this asus

46
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,120
f555 which as you can see a

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,900
processor three orders of magnitude

48
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,020
faster not to mention the fact that

49
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,480
multicore multithreaded multi all

50
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,260
ah sorry I'm  forgot the calculations

51
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,310
at six orders of magnitude plus 4 gb ram

52
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,170
against 4k and a 500 gigabyte hard disk

53
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,680
that the apollo program would have been

54
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,790
abundantly there we know  space would also be

55
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,320
advanced now let's talk about the web

56
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,820
because it is one of the things that has

57
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,959
brought the consumption of the cp

58
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,340
to somewhat embarrassing levels lately

59
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,810
this is the web

60
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,740
in 1991 about this is the first

61
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,040
web page ever created by tim berners lee or

62
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,860
at least rendered  public is only a copy

63
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,850
because the original lost

64
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,220
what is text is ing a minimum of

65
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,280
formatting and little else

66
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,370
this is pure text what is the web today the

67
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,030
web today is this this is the

68
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,550
page of the apple site  promotion of the

69
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,140
ipad apart from that we

70
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,769
can disagree on super computer first or for

71
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:36,470
the spelling second for in short

72
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,720
let's talk about ipad is a supercomputer

73
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,049
this page what is it is text

74
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:43,150
formatting and images especially

75
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,450
images

76
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,769
I would like to point out that the size  on

77
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:52,430
this page there are 3600 what you could

78
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,299
do in 1991 with three mega and 6 you could

79
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:00,920
do this two floppy there was one of the

80
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,170
best three-dimensional video games

81
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,570
in history something went wrong if

82
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,220
a  once

83
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,140
we could have something extremely

84
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,360
cool in two floppies and now

85
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,970
the ipad brochure doesn't even fit

86
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,380
then there are also other things that

87
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,548
we are a little too embarrassed to

88
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,220
talk about in the web so

89
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,410
java applets that were not bad in themselves but  oh well they

90
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,050
had been [ __ ] made activex

91
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,240
let's not talk about it flash fortunately

92
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,150
on the road to the grave what

93
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,720
happened what happened this happened

94
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,120
gmail not only did it happen gmail it

95
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,190
happened google maps

96
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,050
these are the first web applications of

97
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,000
a set of a certain thickness and  of a

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,520
certain popularity that they made use

99
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,440
of web technologies to show us

100
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,810
what it was possible to do in a browser

101
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,479
who's the fault of microsoft obviously who

102
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,440
's the fault of those who have merit it is

103
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,240
microsoft's merit to understand this technology

104
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,000
which is called xml http request that  for

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,349
those a little less experienced in

106
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,910
nomenclature it is what we normally

107
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,240
call ajax or a technology that

108
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,070
allows us to send xml to

109
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,740
asynchronous sync  in mind without having to reload

110
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,479
the page and being able to do it in the laboratories

111
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,580
results once it comes back then in

112
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,810
reality some very fi things have also been done

113
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,160
and on the web

114
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,960
this epic citadel for those who have

115
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,830
never seen it is one they have taken the real

116
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,570
engine which is an engine  to create

117
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,030
video games written in chip

118
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,970
I don't know anymore they compiled it in javascript

119
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,260
and ran it in a browser

120
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,389
this thing runs at 30 frames per second

121
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:42,870
in a browser which in my opinion is a

122
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,330
very cool thing but let's go back to the desktop

123
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,240
we see the evolution of microsoft office

124
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,220
in 2000 microsoft office and required

125
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,349
166 clock media on much more

126
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:58,110
likely single core 16 megabytes

127
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,650
of ram and 526 megabytes of disk space

128
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,659
for a complete installation of office

129
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:06,479
professional or fixed today to do

130
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,760
what you see that is  the cursor

131
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,270
that goes smooth instead of

132
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,380
jerking every time he typed a

133
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,789
letter requires a

134
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:16,919
processor sievert 2 gigabytes of ram and 3

135
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,810
gigabytes of space on it  sco to do

136
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,909
what to write documents in 2000 what

137
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:21,920
did write

138
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,120
documents something went wrong

139
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,100
we are perhaps writing too much code in the

140
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:35,020
sense that we are abstracting more and more

141
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,490
from the machine which in some ways a

142
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,860
good in the sense that it makes it easier to

143
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,090
develop from another point of view  view we

144
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,300


145
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,550
are taking for granted the performance

146
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,220
of our machines especially when

147
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,450
a programmer writes on a

148
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,160
workstation with controcazzi and the poor

149
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,780
user then has to run it on an

150
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,840
asus laptop with an atom core and 2gb of

151
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,820
ram scarce like me this guy who

152
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,380
says  read bad code but it rots and

153
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,750
requires periodic maintenance there

154
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,400
are bugs that must be found

155
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,670
this guy quiri crena is a guy who

156
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,280
wrote the first

157
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,040
apple ii virus in the 80s so in short there will be

158
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,720
few as ruining the lives of people

159
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,590
at  programmers i was thinking

160
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,670
maybe a core 2 duo

161
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,580
if we can get a processor i would like

162
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,430
to point out the date if it was  made here

163
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,410
2005

164
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,470
maybe enough in the sense that we should

165
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,210
write programs light enough

166
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,540
to run smoothly on this first one

167
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,280
because it costs a little second because there are

168
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,930
a lot of incredibly

169
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,610
good machines I think I've also seen a lot of them

170
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,470
around here that still have this

171
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,750
kind of processors and  after 11 years they are

172
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,190
still used perfectly

173
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:04,610
functional now this obviously this

174
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,560
by pulling the question a little but how long

175
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,880
can we make an obsolete machine last

176
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,790
for example a friend how long

177
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,920
we can make a friend last

178
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,240
until June 2015

179
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,320
this computer installed in the

180
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,450
basement of  a school at one

181
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,430
point the school's heating system

182
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,680
stopped working they

183
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,330
went into the meanders to see what the [ __ ]

184
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,310
had happened and they found this

185
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,190
cicinho amiga 500 if I'm not mistaken

186
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,440
that controlled the whole

187
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,059
heating and cooling system in the

188
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,909
whole district  scholastic

189
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,710
I don't know if they have succeeded in satisfying the

190
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,530
progr  amma because if

191
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,940
the hardware broke that time I don't know if they

192
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,740
managed to replace the piece because

193
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,450
obviously it is a machine that went out

194
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,420
of production twenty years ago

195
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,160
ciccio martin here the author of game of

196
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,220
thrones in 2011  he claimed to

197
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,540
use a computer with

198
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,630
only wordperfect bumps installed to write

199
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,530
his own documents

200
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,470
that is to write his own books please

201
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,840
you think you were using imax

202
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,660
now let's see some positive examples

203
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,700
these too brought a bit to the extreme

204
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,290
this and but from the [ __ ] website that is

205
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,720
practically inspired let's say the first

206
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,890
web page ever created is only text only

207
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:42,100
html there is no css there is nothing and

208
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,410
now it is this thing weighs 5 k so

209
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,600
are our famous 640k and the gist

210
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,030
of the conversation between a [ __ ]

211
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:06,650
mother [ __ ] [ __ ] and the other is that in

212
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,840
reality the web should be content

213
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,640
not so much presentation I do not

214
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,230
completely agree and neither was

215
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,700
the guy who created this

216
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,260
page better but of the fac i web  site

217
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:20,829
that strangely even including some pieces

218
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,459
of css embedded in the page reaches 3

219
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:27,839
ke 69 here simply the guy

220
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,610
applied the css rules to line up

221
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,889
the text a little tighter

222
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,750
he changed the font color he

223
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,879
changed the font and little else

224
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,160
in short the  mother [ __ ] website a little

225
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,339
more readable another interesting thing

226
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:45,279
this ten that iap art competition that

227
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,660
ends in September so if you want to

228
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,610
win $ 10,000 in visa credit,

229
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,420
sign up now the challenge is to create

230
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,079
something useful on the web in less than 10

231
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,360
ke without using a library  javascript

232
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,399
and the judges could also look at

233
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,709
your your application with links

234
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:09,719
that has a command line browser

235
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:11,980
the goal is to create

236
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,069
an application that at the first load

237
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:17,589
does not exceed 10k then can go to get

238
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:22,839
stuff gradually depending on how

239
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,339
visual to you but you don't have to use

240
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:28,180
javascript libraries and then there is the

241
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,540
sackler project which aims to create an

242
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,899
ecosystem but userland to dis

243
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:40,630
linux tributions gnu linux not blue because

244
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,339
they replace the blue part for the

245
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:45,720
most part they have also created a

246
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,300
distribution called sta che

247
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,680
sta x static linux because they not only

248
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,509
say the code must be within a certain number

249
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:57,370
of lines because otherwise  it becomes a

250
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,709
brothel they also compile the

251
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,839
programs statically they do not use

252
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,140
dynamic libraries and another

253
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,070
interesting thing that I do not know if you have ever

254
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,500
heard of this little program

255
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,360
here dvd wm is a windows manager in which

256
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,190
the configuration is not done

257
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,780
with files but it is done  modifying the

258
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,699
sources in

259
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,590
ca very few dependencies occupies nothing is

260
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,570
very light it is great cool

261
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,490
if you like windows manager

262
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,910
styling precisely they have also created

263
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,650
this distribution they do a

264
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,570
conference at my tour around europe in

265
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:40,880
general and they are interesting maybe they are a

266
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,470
little extreme especially with

267
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,930
having to modify the source to

268
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,960
configure the programs, however,

269
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,570
I theoretically concluded with this one  I know if you have any questions I am

270
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,000
happy to actually have one

271
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,140
last thing

272
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,790
as you have seen I have not proposed

273
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,510
solutions in reality I wanted to open a

274
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,150
debate that we have even ten minutes

275
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,870
to do if we wanted to is yes in short I have no

276
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,270
solutions personally but I would

277
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,730
like to see that the writer  code was

278
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,110
limited a bit and remembered that not

279
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,030
everyone has their own xeon work station

280
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,890
with 32 gb of ram that's

281
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:29,180
all so questions you have to

282
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,010
start from the machine language of

283
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,900
course when it is started from the

284
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,780
machine language and you have to compile that is you have

285
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,630
to fit everything on a microprocessor  peak

286
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,180
then automatically without meat under

287
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,040
when someone told me but how not to

288
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,950
multitasking and multitasking then

289
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,070
learned to see what the 898 byte is

290
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,980
the last program I did well with

291
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,950
teramo is the pic at 60

292
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,760
16 that of the arduino well sorry sides

293
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,520
mega  sorry 32 or type you want to prove

294
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,400
with msp 430 that the coolest of all at

295
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,569
512 mbyte of ram

296
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,990
bye bye bye there is no question it

297
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,250
means  that I said a lot of

298
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,870
cool things you explain it well

299
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,500
it is not a question it is the

300
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,690
consideration that in my opinion for how

301
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,400
difficult things are going more and more

302
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,800
users more and more memory less and less

303
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,540
people who open sea well

304
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,890
everything right what you said

305
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,920
sin  that promises will not be applied

306
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,480
if I'm sure but let's start with us

307
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,530
maybe let's try talking about

308
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,280
paranoid people a friend of mine the other day

309
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,140
I was also saying to him he

310
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,440
threw a megagalactic [ __ ] on the fact that there

311
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,040
are what the multi core processor

312
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,020
what can they do  other whole forms

313
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,990
you are executing your code

314
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,570
and then he only uses 32

315
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,710
bit single core processors

316
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,450
we also write for him poor code he

317
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,850
will have the right to use a single core

318
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,300
I was wondering meanwhile introduce himself monza I

319
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,080
am livio rossa who works together with

320
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,330
class and  I see all day

321
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:32,070
that ass is pity I wanted to ask myself

322
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,170
whether or not to raise the question

323
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,450
of development tools because instrument  the

324
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,510
current ones tend to bring up

325
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,830
addictions as if it were raining we are

326
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,920
talking about grunt for example maven with

327
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,290
long pinks it is normal so much there are

328
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,600
libraries so much if I have to make a left pad

329
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,700
someone has already done it npm in store

330
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,180
ipad and these I could interesting

331
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,380
what you say left pad

332
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,960
tell us do you remember the story

333
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,860
of the fed was a library on js notes

334
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,310
that did an extremely stupid thing it

335
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,360
carried the strings a certain length by

336
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,279
adding spaces at

337
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,899
the beginning the thing that anyone can do by themselves

338
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,980
but in this ecosystem  of libraries that

339
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,980
do everything yes someone proposed as a

340
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,050
library as a module it was so

341
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,879
easy to install them use it that

342
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,550
many did for some reason the

343
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,889
guy withdrew it from repositories and thousands

344
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,449
of programs all over the world

345
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:30,420
all ran away at the same time

346
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,389
what I was wondering is that  current

347
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:35,999
modern tools can be used if you really want to reduce

348
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:39,269
the memory footprint and resources

349
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,290
of your

350
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,459
probabilm software  ente we should

351
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,160
start from that or not okay I

352
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,889
'm not saying that we all use turbo c plus

353
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:50,069
more thing but in the sense

354
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:51,899
we will probably have to start from those in

355
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,370
reality the question is this if I

356
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,319
write in I did write a

357
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:00,540
program that does a non-trivial thing

358
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,819
I can write it in c I can write it in

359
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:03,650
python too

360
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,369
bad that the one in python

361
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,839
will probably be orders of magnitude

362
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,569
slower and will need orders of

363
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,000
magnitude of more resources

364
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,280
so you have to balance

365
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,339
the development effort on

366
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,339
the one hand and the efficiency of the code on the other probably  if

367
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,780
we had the opportunity to write

368
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,520
development tools that allow me

369
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,990
to easily code

370
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,399
libraries or libraries in you

371
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:31,320
also know that maybe they hide the

372
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,140
complexities of c from me we begin to write

373
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,169
all compiled languages instead of

374
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:39,750
interpreted languages I don't know c '  is a

375
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,580
solution to be found there is probably

376
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,580
a solution of it seems silly that

377
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,320
thirty years ago you p  he could do it and now

378
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,580
it can't be done anymore I realized it was

379
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,640
much more complicated but [ __ ]

380
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,460
programmers collectively we can

381
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,570
find a solution together it

382
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,420
would be thread let's start

383
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,740
with the development tools he has a good idea

384
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,360
in my opinion there is the method it could

385
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,040
start already on October 1st just

386
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,430
one  tax on the size of the

387
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,090
program automatically try a

388
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,490
role to renzi who just charges

389
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,470
up the mega money and I can

390
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,570
assure you that the software will stay three k

391
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,440
in fact it will all end up in the

392
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,180
dynamic libraries and then programs will then be

393
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:41,360
small megons

394
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,700
I recently saw a video of  a

395
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,060
guy who tried to use an atari st

396
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,250
as a daily machine

397
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,490
apart from mp3 but obviously

398
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,680
most of the things

399
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,190
spreadsheets web mail you can do it very

400
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,770
calmly but you can

401
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,890
then probably also your

402
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:32,580
program in basic very fast elite  no that

403
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:50,830
's how long it took is I guess

404
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:57,100
other ideas oh well semi pecked around

405
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,350
you want to talk about it willingly

406
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,000
so thanks to everyone
