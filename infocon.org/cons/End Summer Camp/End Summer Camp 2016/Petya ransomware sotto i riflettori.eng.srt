1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:13,019
ma para para buongiorno a tutti is the

2
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,350
first talk of the day and we have

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,109
gianfranco tonello good morning

4
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:20,789
graduate in computer engineering

5
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,900
deals with malware in a society that

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,060
boasts of roses far away you

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,689
write in scientific technical magazines

8
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:33,870
and if here talking to us about power it is correct

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,260
an applause to  te ok

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,649
today I will talk to you dar answer petilia and the

11
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,230
talk will analyze how it has

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,350
evolved in recent months it was

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,260
beating at low level encryption the

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,199
disk going to the city of the master pal

15
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,750
table and in this way it makes

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,329
the disk inaccessible and asks for a

17
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,170
ransom

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,549
the first  version of pitti a which was

19
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:09,450
intercepted dates back to March 2016 and was

20
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,580
discovered by the researchers of g data which

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,630
are ideas between and after in the following months

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,270
two new variants were released

23
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,490
in May and July of this year pittia

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,990
is transmitted via e-

25
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,080
mail  exploits the

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,700
whole way social engineering on tour

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,640
the unfortunate victim to run

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,700
the infected attachment attachment which contains

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,000
the draw pe  r of pt to this dropper, however,

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,630
needs administrator rights

31
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,070
because it infects the master boot

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,710
record and overwrites the first 58

33
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,740
sectors of the disk in this first phase

34
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,020
of attack

35
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,110
the drop of the pta is calculated a

36
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,430
32-bit key

37
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,149
which is written  in sector 36 and

38
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,780
is sent for its own command and

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,040
control purposes,

40
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,740
then through the undocumented floors they

41
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,340
were already a blue screen

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,709
and if the user has deactivated

43
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,560
automatic rv he can see it on the screen on the

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,730
third video this here even if little

45
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,870
light contrasts do not  he sees very well ok

46
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,819
at this moment when the

47
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,459
blue screen appears the first phase of attack has

48
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,129
finished with a beating at this moment

49
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:34,830
he has only infected lemme lemme br and

50
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,099
has not encrypted lamarque puts well let

51
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,569
's see what happened in this first phase

52
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,440
of attack line  and br for a sector on the

53
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,780
rate infected lauder faults with the

54
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,569
loder code activation data

55
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,440
sectors from 1 to 22 are encrypted with

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,060
exor 37 from sector 22 onwards contain  and

57
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,849
precisely the body of petilia in sector

58
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,780
36 the encryption key is memorized

59
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,620
an initialization vector

60
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,379
for the rhythm and encryption the addresses

61
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,099
of toro news

62
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,549
and lidi of the victim in sector 37

63
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:16,859
instead it was initialized with only the

64
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:19,530
character 7 each byte compares the value

65
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,950
7  of character 7 immediately sector 38

66
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,889
we find the original mbr always encrypted

67
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,519
with hicks a 37 sector 39 instead is

68
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,269
empty

69
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,790
contains only 0 and will be used as

70
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,430
data sectors

71
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,549
interesting is sector 36 which is

72
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:42,930
structured in this way the first byte

73
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,150
were not  managed to see it

74
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,940
I think not ok the first white contains

75
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,079
the status of the disk

76
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,510
if a zero value means the disk

77
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,120
still to be encrypted if a value 1 indicates

78
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,040
that the disk has been encrypted both value

79
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,090
2 means that the disk has been

80
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,959
decrypted and 32 bytes  which

81
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,030
are here in red fiat in red with the

82
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,220
red frame contains the

83
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,109
encryption key that was generated by the

84
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,109
dropper ok this encryption key

85
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:12,299
However, he obtained 32 huts starting from a

86
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,440
key

87
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,230
consisting of sixteen huts, the following 8 gbytes

88
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,560
contain the famous

89
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,120
algorithm initialization vector and

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,890
encryption then follow the

91
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,070
poland addresses of the victim sector

92
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,350
37 as I said contains only the

93
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,820
character 7 is made up  the subsequent

94
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,550
restart of the machine begins phase 2

95
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,520
of pitiana the oval bios mbr

96
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,010
lauder charges the other goes to read sector

97
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,010
22 the whole body and petit lla and at this

98
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,980
point it goes to read sector 36 and the

99
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,990
disk checks the status of speeches at

100
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,960
value  zero and starts encrypting the disc

101
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,540
the master file table displays

102
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,000
a false ska check which

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,980
the increase here that we see indicates the

104
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,470
number of states of one of the sectors of

105
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,160
death between encrypted tables let's see what

106
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,100
happens this asset phase at 36 but

107
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,860
this  sector is updated the state

108
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,860
of the disk passes from 0 to 1 the

109
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,600
encryption key that was previously present is

110
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,300
deleted and the vector of

111
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,390
initials remains  zzation and the toromio

112
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,080
and shores addresses of the victim sector 37

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,720
instead of before in phase 1 contained

114
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,930
only character 7 now

115
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,150
the encryption is well encrypted via exor

116
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,310
but the ex or keys are obtained

117
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,300
from the output table of the algorithm and

118
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,960
encryption that  è salsa 20 pt a uses

119
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,080
the salsa 20 encryption algorithm

120
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,260
which needs to have an input a

121
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,270
table I have a real rule called

122
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,720
mars boldi 64 bytes this table is

123
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,669
initialized and initially initialized with the

124
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,100
fixed string written ex panda 32

125
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,430
gbyte k  where the first four are taken

126
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,520
the first overflow is lofted 0 and

127
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,930
after which it was taken up by offset 15

128
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,480
the patron is sure you then the

129
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,880
initialization vector in this position is initialized with the 32 byte key

130
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,620


131
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,150
here and after there is a counter

132
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,970
8 bytes that comes with initial value

133
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:33,320
0 sauce 20 is an encryption algorithm

134
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,160
that performs 32-bit operation performs

135
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,980
exor sum operation and

136
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,370
bit rotation

137
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,250
the version however impl  ementata da beats

138
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,290
and a 16-bit operation beats

139
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,690
are not salsa people 20 gen

140
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,630
this the famous enough 64-byte table

141
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,360
in this way after which it creates two

142
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,230
32-byte sub-tables where

143
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,970
only the least significant award was taken, however

144
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,440
ex capo at 0 k1 k4

145
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,630
k5 forward so

146
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,110
the for table 1 is passed on the

147
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,910
operations that is undergone by the sauce

148
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,910
20 then it sums shift rotations the

149
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,760
sora and after the final result Friday

150
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,250
added to the initial table and at the end

151
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,630
obtains an output table of  64 bytes

152
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,340
where, however, the most significant world is

153
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,030
always

154
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,010
0 based on this scheme used the

155
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,040
tower of the pd is however lost 16

156
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,880
bytes of the password used by the

157
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,360
starting 32 only 16 are

158
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,950
used in the encryption but there is

159
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,810
another thing

160
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,060
as I said before the password of 32

161
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,670
huts obtained starting from a password

162
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,390
of 16 bytes is the type that the first

163
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,960
k0 value of the paste 32 obtained from bizarre value by

164
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,970
adding 7a and k1 and obtained

165
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,510
pre  ndendo the bizarre

166
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,640
multiplying it by two

167
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,030
in this way, however, only the first eight

168
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,470
bytes of the initial password of 16 bytes

169
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,780
is used by petilia it also lasts the

170
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,380
encryption with sauce 20 so even if

171
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,360
the author of pete is tender with a

172
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,690
password of 32 bytes  only 8 are

173
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,190
actually involved in during

174
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,600
the opening at this point it starts encrypting

175
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,960
the

176
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,929
mtt mt the shows rolling slices divided by iv

177
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,600
sector at a time and is encrypted

178
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,610
by hicks now where the dic keys

179
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:49,050
only are 64 sauce output tables

180
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,870
20 obtained by varying the counter

181
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,590
who saw at the beginning this field here

182
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,050
counter from zero to 63 when it has

183
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,200
finished encrypting all the mt in

184
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,180
sector 39 makes us write the number of

185
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,180
encrypted clusters and after which the

186
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,200
computer gradually starts

187
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,710
this point in phase iii and it

188
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,110
is displayed  the instruction of the

189
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,450
ransom in the game the victim who

190
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,910
avoids the user who victim dhahran on the

191
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,860
petit the addresses

192
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,280
bull poland is displayed where to pay the ransom

193
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,880
and  at this point the petit e

194
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,620
waits for the user to insert the

195
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,670
key he bought the next step

196
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,800
the user tries to insert a pitt key

197
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,380
and goes to verify

198
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,260
the input that goes to verify he

199
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,450
fetches the first 16 characters  that

200
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,270
belong to this set of 54

201
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,180
alpha characters from alpha numeric from 1 to 9

202
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,310
from a lowercase hicks

203
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,930
and from uppercase ics from these 16

204
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,710
characters ok the password is calculated at 32

205
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,560
as based on this scheme that I have

206
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,840
indicated before and after which having  the

207
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,910
mass at 32

208
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,010
bit passes it on the distance algorithm 20

209
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,580
obtains the auto of false minds and goes to

210
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,340
decrypt sector 37

211
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,760
if each byte of sector 37 contains the

212
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,160
character 7 yes because the power that has

213
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,080
been inserted echoes open and then

214
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,860
proceeds to go  to decrypt the master to

215
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,890
table this point and restore the

216
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,790
original brs and restart the computer,

217
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,460
however, we can determine the

218
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,850
encryption key used in fact because it is

219
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,820
useful for the site 37 to verify

220
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,230
the correctness of the who  ave inserted

221
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,830
we take the sector 37 encrypted we do

222
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,560
the operations towards some qusur 37 and

223
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,380
we obtain in output a table with the

224
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,820
512 clear on this you can see the

225
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,700
encrypted sutor we did luxor we get

226
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,880
this table which 512 that lived

227
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,430
this table and obtained by concatenating

228
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,150
the eight outputs of  sauce 20

229
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,280
starting with a pointer 0

230
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,340
up to the counter 7

231
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,780
now here we can apply

232
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,600
genetic or half holistic algorithms and

233
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,460
we can determine the

234
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,780
encryption key it used

235
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,350
we know that the

236
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,230
key length is eight characters how it works

237
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,180
and the goal  of cost we are going to

238
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,550
minimize the number of different bits

239
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,660
that exists between the hypothesized solution and

240
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,030
the output table of the

241
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,870
actual solution and from our tests carried out it

242
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,730
is able to determine the

243
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,910
encryption key in about ten seconds

244
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,500
in fact the solutions with  the

245
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,870
twin genetic or meteoritic algorithms that

246
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,450
use cube-type search and point

247
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,760
towards sol  In order to

248
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,720
verify this,

249
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,730
we have compared the various

250
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:10,240
output tables of salsa 20 these here

251
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,930
and we see that with minimal variations

252
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,520
of the input counter which therefore

253
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,300
varies from 0 to 7 therefore 123 bits we obtain

254
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,780
minimal variations of the output ad  example

255
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,040
the table of three with the t 1 has only

256
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,970
thirteen bt of difference on 512 another

257
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,760
approach we have tried is

258
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,080
to letera the table of 512 keys

259
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,360
explora as if it were like

260
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,090
representing it as a 16

261
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:44,990
shades of gray image

262
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,030
we have it  transformed that site into a high

263
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,080
of gray

264
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,600
then we applied a filter to the

265
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,730
local binary patterns that usually

266
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,140
used for facial recognition

267
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,860


268
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,990
we obtained a further image that

269
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,570
looks like 16

270
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,640
shades of gray and we calculated

271
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,460
the frequency of the various shades

272
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,830
and represented them with relative

273
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,800
histograms  we calculated their

274
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,430
simile after having normalized them and

275
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,740
I paid the similar turiaco by making

276
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,660
an intersection  ne also in this case it

277
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,550
can be seen that with a minimum variation of

278
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,450
123 bits

279
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,170
the output tables obtained from the

280
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,940
images we deal with the x ball in the

281
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,370
pattern can have a similarity

282
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,340
ranging from 70 to 90 percent

283
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,540
this too can be another

284
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,660
approach  how it works objective in

285
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,450
may 2016 however petit abi and for the

286
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,700
authors of petit released a new

287
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,360
version la b where

288
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,620
some errors were corrected and the first collection is that

289
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,250
the drop e in version a needed

290
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,900
to be safe executed with

291
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,000
administrator rights  in version b

292
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,190
now you are drop very well without

293
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,380
administrator rights goes to release a

294
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,260
new rushworth misha and which goes to

295
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,360
encrypt the couple of documents with the

296
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,330
usual modalities

297
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,980
if instead the rapper has performed with the

298
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,140
administrator crimes but infecting the

299
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,570
mbr tasks also has in  this version

300
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,970
more use an initial password of

301
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,400
16 characters this time the password

302
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,220
that becomes from 32 and obtained with how many

303
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,560
and and  ò the first 16 carats with itself

304
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,860
and now in this version well

305
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,590
applied sauce 20 with the 32-bit operation

306
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,010


307
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,710
but the author made a mistake

308
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,780
in using the assembly instruction

309
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,420
gives us brio of which means to convert

310
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,760
a worden one of  word during the

311
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,220
creation of the master table and in

312
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,050
this case this error in using

313
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,660
this instruction between so that the sign

314
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,180
of the least significant world vasco

315
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,910
cover writing the most significant award

316
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,090
in this case means that also this

317
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,250
time always 8 characters are

318
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,770
used for the  encryption through

319
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,150
the salsa algorithm and not 16 or 32

320
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,500
here we can see how the hits

321
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,050
between table are now the tables are 64

322
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,540
gbyte

323
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,860
the question mark has avenged

324
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,320
the sign extension can be zero or

325
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,470
minus one the resulting output table

326
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,810
in  this in version b

327
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,399
as you can see the most

328
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,470
significant word is no longer 0 but it is different

329
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,949
from zero here we can see here too

330
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:27,959
we can try to determine the key

331
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:32,339
encryption this case sector 37

332
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,920
was initialized with the value of 007

333
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,149
ok let's redo luxor we get our

334
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:41,910
8 salsa 20 output tables and

335
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,250
let's try to calculate the

336
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,500
encryption key let's compare the various

337
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,139
salsa 20 output tables and now

338
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,480
we  we see that minimal variations of

339
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,050
point the counter large variations

340
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,300
on the output for example between the drill t

341
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,350
0 and the tv and where grandson there is a piece of

342
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,220
difference gets a difference of 256

343
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,490


344
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,339
bits 50 percent and therefore the algorithms

345
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,410
that is new  seen by pete away

346
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,600
all fail no one saw

347
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,279
the solution evolve now the

348
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,040
optimal solution but the bad force comes to our aid

349
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,949
because the number of

350
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:23,720
combinations is a low number 54 to 8

351
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,370
so to calculate the encryption key it

352
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,709
takes a few weeks in

353
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:30,690
the worst case and  so it's a long time more

354
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,310
than a hand and you can determine the

355
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:36,480
encryption key in July

356
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,079
the last known version was released where

357
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,870
the bug is fixed on  on the length

358
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,899
of the blatant it took some time

359
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,329
now all the senses characters

360
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:50,779
are used during the encryption

361
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:53,610
and when it has encrypted files effects however

362
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,370
it is no longer possible to determine the

363
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,000
encryption key because that point maybe we

364
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,399
are no longer

365
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,240
hundreds of human times  years this version is

366
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,809
now sold as a service to

367
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:12,529
alter cybercriminals successful reads

368
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:14,269
what he wrote here here is a table

369
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:16,579
with the costs who wants to buy the

370
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,789
service are the royalties that will be

371
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,699
paid the criminal organization

372
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:25,759
calls himself janus now the

373
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,009
conclusions I have seen that petilia is a

374
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:30,220
run on why it uses the approach of

375
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,440
decrypting laimer that we have seen

376
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,990
that you incorrectly apply sauce 20 you

377
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,230
can determine the encryption key

378
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,360
I have seen that the why between the mezzetti

379
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,340
needs to be followed as an

380
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,169
administrator therefore from the  from

381
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:47,629
variant b a new

382
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:50,749
throne vr answer is released which is to encrypt

383
00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:53,779
document files with the means of  usual in

384
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,700
recent months there has been an evolution of

385
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,639
pt to up to being sold

386
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:01,340
as a service other cyber criminals

387
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,470
we can profit races the attack of

388
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,129
pt a going to intercept at a low

389
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:07,879
level

390
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:11,269
the overwriting of the mpr in this

391
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:12,619
way is no longer in  able to smell the

392
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:14,419
mvr and consequently is no longer able

393
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:18,499
to decipher the mst as you might

394
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:20,960
have guessed the authors of

395
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,960
petilia all the author are fans of james

396
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,919
bond both picchia and misha are two names

397
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,559
of russian satellites that are mentioned

398
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,619
in the film goldeneye and  the

399
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:36,230
criminal organization janus is the

400
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,950
criminal organization opposed to tennis

401
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,110
currently merge this

402
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,259
criminal organization into two twitter accounts one

403
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,659
that was opened in april is a june

404
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,129
2016

405
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,200
the last post we find at that of

406
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,629
august 23 where their service is sold

407
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:55,309
of petit to those who want to

408
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:56,080
buy it

409
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,189
I pre-finished question do

410
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:38,749
you feel

411
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:42,749
sorry the approach of the mbr figure is

412
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,609
rather old so much so that even

413
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:51,119
old  who bajos blocking mine for a moment

414
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,940
surprised the charm said of the

415
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,949
solution for three points of view and first

416
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:59,159
the mbl approach second the interface

417
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,729
that is displayed to you and third you do not

418
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:05,099
step on your hand not much is explained

419
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:07,619
as others of the blood are done  what

420
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:10,829
do you have to do for the typical user who does not

421
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:16,349
even know what is being guided a little they

422
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,609
leave you much more information

423
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:24,269
intrigue psychology of those who

424
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:26,099
wrote this genre some idea

425
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,889
then everyone criticized this type

426
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:31,019
of approach because it has to put

427
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:34,649
the user had ease of  pay it if

428
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:37,589
one has infected tasks or ob it

429
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:39,839
happens that one is in the

430
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,119
locked computer and there are other pc's he has to

431
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,989
contact someone else

432
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:48,179
the biggest problem is that he has to

433
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,889
manually copy the key to

434
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:54,389
his ok then typing copy error

435
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:56,369
so it's not much  serious

436
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:57,749
because the very long string of

437
00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:00,710
its own then and therefore

438
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,450
in my opinion it did not earn a lot of

439
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,909
money for the truth ok the second

440
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:06,470
app  in the first version there was

441
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,299
the error that to avoid the bbr it

442
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:09,799
needs to have the rights of the

443
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,049
ministers tor

444
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:13,610
now you account in windows that welcome

445
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,870
account against activated the file to

446
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,610
buy the screen will run or

447
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,240
not as ministers for therefore the

448
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,149
possibility  then to dino get infected the

449
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:31,490
second point that you can block

450
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,559
the infection of phase 1 because in

451
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,419
phase 1 it absolutely goes to infect the

452
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,090
bible steals encrypt the speech if or

453
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,279
disabled and automatic start I see that

454
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:42,380
there is a blue screen for

455
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,090
most users and  they will not understand the computer will arrive

456
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:44,720


457
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,909
ok but one can have the ok to a

458
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:49,279
chance to make a fix to change

459
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,740
that moment there and remove the infection

460
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,740
and then pt I does not even start it

461
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,279
seems to us the disc

462
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,789
I would like to add another thing the authors

463
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:04,610
of  pitti a few weeks ago as

464
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,440
they are a bit of competition with other

465
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,490
raf four developers they blocked

466
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,809
the chimera transfer site and

467
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,700
made public the keys to  the ration of

468
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,110
those less for everyone a way for perhaps those who

469
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,990
write other viruses to do that they go to

470
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,880
buy the petillo product more

471
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,580
fray than other producers of

472
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,320
rafer type chimera or crypto pp pio pinto

473
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,720
xx other questions

474
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,790
then I thank you
