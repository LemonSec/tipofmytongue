1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
thank you for coming so many

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,380
since the cameras do not see all the

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,620
public there and I am very pleased to

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,139
be here talking at the summer camp about

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,320
a topic that perhaps a little particular

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,750
but I consider absolutely very very

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,810
very very current because as

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,730
you all know  or as you can imagine since

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,760
you came this afternoon here

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,330
we talk about how the states have been from a

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,179
reality for a few years now

12
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:32,009
using cyberspace or in

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,980
general technologies to arm themselves in

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,020
quotes to do a whole series of

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,960
activities that go  from espionage

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,520
through the secret services to the

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,960
actual warfare activities

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,879
therefore more and more conflictuality

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,309
through technologies and the internet

20
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,300


21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,910
I introduce myself I am stefano mele I am a

22
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,620
lawyer specialized in technology law,

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,449
privacy and

24
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,809
information protection but for many years I have been carrying out a

25
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,219
series of activities both

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,180
nationally and

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,350
therefore with our ministry

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,470
of  rape that in the context born on all

29
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,260
those that are the issues related

30
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,180
to cyber security to cyber terrorism

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,670
to cyber warfare therefore to

32
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,900
the use of technologies for purposes

33
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,240
of conflict between states and

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,280
so on

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,830
the current scenario in reality perhaps the

36
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,570
current scenario given that  you are still

37
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,970
an audience of technicians and certainly

38
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,909
perhaps better known to you than to me in any

39
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,850
case I really like to always use

40
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,180
the slides you will see for some

41
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,240
time now because the first

42
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,680
question I was asked a few

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,350
years ago  more than anything else in the aftermath of

44
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,180
stuxnet then internal in 2010

45
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,840
especially in the military but also

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,149
in other areas when I was talking about these

47
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:51,720
matters

48
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,640
and if indeed the technologies to

49
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,490
the internet could be and if they

50
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,340
are still a threat to national security today,

51
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,540


52
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,579
obviously the answer  yes otherwise we will

53
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,100
not be here talking and reasoning

54
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,459
for these 45 minutes together

55
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,459
obviously if you want to interpret  At

56
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,319
any time ask me questions

57
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,170
if I am not clear tell me and I will

58
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,090
try to explain better until

59
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,489
I can explain why it is a

60
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:22,200
real threat to national security

61
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,180
for these three reasons you see in the

62
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,859
slides exponential increase in the number

63
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:27,920
of attacks and this is perhaps

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,019
the  'most obvious element but also there has been

65
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,549
a multiplication of actors

66
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:34,560
so until a few years ago we

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,870
imagined and you but nigi navate

68
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,909
and installments certainly more than aware of

69
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,439
cyberspace as something

70
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,219
within which criminals moved to the

71
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,650
maximum  so you know perfectly well

72
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,599
the crime with cybercrime

73
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,250
and how much it has developed and how much it has

74
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,409
continued to develop for some years now

75
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,959
more and more have

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,849
entered this scenario

77
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:58,709
that was a classic scenario that

78
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,000
we lived in the 90s and

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,040
above all  from 2000 onwards more and

80
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,569
more states have

81
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,579
also brought intelligence agencies

82
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:08,250
and attention to  these matters has

83
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,280
raised the level of the need for

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,709
malware and therefore

85
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:16,319
more and more real companies have arisen which

86
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,599
as a cybercrime activity

87
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,870
provide this kind of tools

88
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,129
also to states to

89
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:24,739
intelligence agencies and this has

90
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:27,299
automatically led to the third element that is

91
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,340
there has been an increase not only

92
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,989
as you can see above in the number of

93
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:33,870
attacks but in the quality of the attacks

94
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,790
and above all in the objectives and

95
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,370
targets because states are not interested in

96
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,329
doing business

97
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,819
basically what interests them is

98
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,370
an interest as you will see geopolitical is

99
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,280
an interest of conflict therefore

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,829
not of war and conflict state

101
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,769
against state many times it is a

102
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:54,829
purely certainly interest in

103
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:58,319
economic but high-level quotes and therefore

104
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,180
more and more we began to

105
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,699
listen and hear I make a name for

106
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,469
everyone you know perfectly well that stack

107
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:08,969
set of malware that

108
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:10,979
critical infrastructures  they are calls of one  it was

109
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:13,739
then stuxnet in 2010 hit the

110
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:14,870
uranium enrichment plant

111
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,060
kissing natanz physically splitting them and

112
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,949
then interrupting the

113
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:22,830
uranium enrichment in those specific sites for

114
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,969
two years

115
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:26,290
attention a fundamental element

116
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,240
that is rarely read especially

117
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,070
when it comes to cyber army  between

118
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,650
quotation marks in the newspapers

119
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,470
when we talk about this kind of weapons

120
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,450
because stuxnet is a weapon because it does

121
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,390
physical damage we never talk about the fact

122
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,430
that this kind of weapons up to this

123
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,130
moment has done and will still do, I believe, for

124
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,120
many years

125
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,670
a  damage level very limited

126
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,400
in time i.e. it is not a missile that

127
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,080
hits a

128
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,810
uranium enrichment plant in iran and destroys and

129
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,580
pulverizes it and then you have to do it again from

130
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,390
scratch

131
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,910
stuxnet and sorry you will hear me

132
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,650
mention the name of stuxnet several times because it is

133
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,930
there  'unique the only malware the only software

134
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,060
that I believe to be

135
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,520
legally classifiable as a weapon among those

136
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,590
we know alm  eno at a public level

137
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,070
stack set asi did a damage but it did

138
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,230
a damage that after two years was

139
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,730
recovered that is the cooling fans were changed

140
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,930


141
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,820
so the time to get them to

142
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,920
get them to reassemble them and the

143
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,690
central uranium enrichment one returned

144
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,570
as new therefore in the scale of values

145
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,220
within a weapon especially

146
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,630
when it comes to military level and

147
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,670
therefore of attacks and conflicts it is

148
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,920
actually a very very limited weapon or damage

149
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,840
andrea

150
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,100
functioned fortunately for now aimed at

151
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,310
hitting implants from  this life will be held

152
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,980
is not always considered apple 1

153
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,190
lion know that apple a let's leave an ok

154
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,980
thanks shumov it is that malware

155
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,080
you have all heard that hit

156
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,380
the saudi aramco in 2012 that

157
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,300
basically simplifying it eni

158
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,430
of saudi arabia but obviously as

159
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,840
you can imagine they extract a  little

160
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,820
more in saudi arabia

161
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,310
what did this malware

162
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,780
completely formatted 30 thousand

163
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,470
computers

164
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,430
if I'm not mistaken it is  the attack honestly

165
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,410
was enough at least for what

166
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,669
I was able to study let's say quite

167
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,840
trivial from the point of view at least when

168
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,720
compared to stuxnet as you know it had

169
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,350
if 33 or 40 of the twelve vulnerabilities

170
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,140
concatenate therefore a perfect chain

171
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,600
of software and exploits that  they

172
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
were used to do that level

173
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,990
of damage and to do that kind of

174
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,910
activity they are rather trivial,

175
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,729
i.e. it has the effect of having

176
00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:00,530
formatted 30 thousand computers now both

177
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,940
a weapon and not a weapon I do not

178
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,960
consider it a cyber weapon not  I know why

179
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,180
shamu did not work and where shumov could have

180
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,880
reached it

181
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,640
yes it is now but in any case

182
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,610
no publicly

183
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,020
at least for what you know it

184
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,900
worked to do that so it is

185
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,210
clear that when you were

186
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,800
able to do a level of damage

187
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,630
certainly

188
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,610
surely Saudi Aramco can be

189
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,880
considered a critical infrastructure for Saudi Arabia that is

190
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,680
certainly

191
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,440
legally critical at least in my opinion at  my

192
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,760
opinion because there is no

193
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,880
formally accepted legal definition of

194
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,680
what a cyber weapon is I gave it in 2012

195
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,600
and therefore I basically follow

196
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,470
my study reasonings

197
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,730
in that case then it could be

198
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,640
qualified as a cyber weapon we

199
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,920
could have however  also verify that that

200
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,630
cyber weapon had been used by a

201
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,770
state or by an actor who, on behalf of

202
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,020
a state, therefore formally hired

203
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,910
by a state, had made that kind of

204
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,080
attack because this is another

205
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,480
element that is certainly fundamental because

206
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,730
otherwise we are going to tell ourselves that

207
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,980
any  software that does physical damage

208
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,010
to an infrastructure has been

209
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,750
classified as critical infrastructure

210
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,840
laws telecommunications energy

211
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,030
transport supplies of ge

212
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,370
or in some countries for example it can

213
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,750
certainly be a critical infrastructure

214
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,480
a company that extracts oil because

215
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,610
in the case it is a huge economic damage if

216
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,919
you  blocks for days the main

217
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,260
extractor of  oil at a national level it is

218
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,370


219
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,110
clear that if we do not parameterize

220
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,299
this kind of damage even if it

221
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,640
happens to the behavior of a state

222
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,220
then anything can be

223
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,410
identified as a weapon and given the

224
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,600
very low level of reliability that is on the

225
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,310
problem of attribution that you

226
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,410
all know  that is to understand who

227
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,600
actually did a damage

228
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,580
and it is clear that when there is

229
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,100
a weapon and when we

230
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,140
believe that it was a state but

231
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,610
maybe a state has not been, we can

232
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,140
manipulate as the military and

233
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,820
the  'perhaps escalation of a conflict

234
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,160
so I am very very cautious

235
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,930
from this point of view but

236
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,210
we will see it later however what

237
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,190
interests me is that it is the reason for the

238
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,750
affirmative answer that it is a

239
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,580
real threat to national security that the

240
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,440
quality has risen a lot because

241
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,390
have intervened on the scenario

242
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,220
of high-level actors as are the

243
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,530
states the cyber attacks can be

244
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,180
used to manipulate the

245
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,600
info  rmations propaganda activism

246
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,020
these have always been done

247
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,670
the manipulation of information has

248
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,410
always done propaganda even at

249
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,050
the state against state level has always

250
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,570
been activism technologies are

251
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,510
yet another tool to do this

252
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,340
kind of activity

253
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,380
lately we are seeing  that a state

254
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,510
like russia is doing a lot of

255
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,910
information manipulation a lot of

256
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,620
propaganda is doing it very well

257
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,960
through technologies behaviors

258
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,900
that have been done by states since the dawn

259
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,470
of time

260
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,090
during the second world war

261
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,500
flew with airplanes and threw

262
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,240
flyers in 2016

263
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,160
they do it through  internet some

264
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,280
do it very well I am not worried about cybercrime I do not tell

265
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,230
you about it because as

266
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,390
I said it was something that I believe you

267
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,860
know very well however a

268
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,070
phenomenon that has persisted for many

269
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,760
many years and is still growing I

270
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,530
am talking about electronic espionage

271
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,600
I will tell you quickly  terrorism and I

272
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,890
'll tell you about this word  a little

273
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,230
complicated which means easy that there is

274
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,180
written that facilitating kinetic attacks

275
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,510
that is, it means

276
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,150
that through technologies

277
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,500
a traditional military attack is made easier

278
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,520
and simplifying how comfortable it is

279
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,520
for a state to enter the

280
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,110
computer systems for controlling the

281
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,890
airspace of an opposing government

282
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,140
disable them without turning them off make

283
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,940
your fighter-bombers fly up

284
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,250
arrive on the territory bomb and

285
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,020
leave without anyone

286
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,580
noticing until the first

287
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,500
missile has destroyed the target is

288
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,950
very convenient very well if we give credit

289
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,840
to what is written on it  internet

290
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,630
therefore no confidential information

291
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,930
israel in 2007 in 2007 that is almost

292
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,240
ten years ago before bombing a

293
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,890
uranium enrichment plant in

294
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,410
damascus then in syria it penetrated

295
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,240
the siliano airspace control computer systems it

296
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,490
disabled without turning them

297
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,230
off it caused to raise in  I fly

298
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,570
the fighters bombed and Syria

299
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,010
the  Syrian government noticed the

300
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,510
attack after the first

301
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,940
missile destroyed the enrichment plant

302
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,870


303
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,500
no anti-aircraft no ability to

304
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,170
fuse retaliation in real time

305
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,580
perfect finished 2007

306
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,980
let's think about cast accent 2010 these are

307
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,220
all facilitators sorry no tax is not

308
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,630
a facilitator of  kinetic attacks

309
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,590
but surely this is 2007 it is

310
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,390
I use very often the

311
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,100
clusit report which andrea zapparoli manzoni

312
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,410
writes about it, who writes a part of the report but

313
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,720
also sofia that here

314
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,190
oh well me when I say andreazza taken

315
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,480
with the family of andrea zepponi

316
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,010
manzoni not in a while  even two

317
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,590
splendid children will make it clear they will write something

318
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,200
about cybersecurity because it is a family

319
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,060
totally focused on cyber

320
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,140
security

321
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,000
this is an Italian report the report

322
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,190
that there is how much effort it takes to

323
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,170
take all the data constantly from the

324
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,970
internet take it, analyze it and

325
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,460
classify it, look at the

326
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,560
percentages that  andrea and all

327
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,930
the clusit ci com team  in

328
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,750
the last report the percentages of growth and

329
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,090
attention cybercrime is fine continues to

330
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,570
grow

331
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,490
look at how much everything has grown between

332
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,310
2011 and 2012 the black year basically

333
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,470
of cybersecurity the percentages

334
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,130
cybercrime doubt 272 percent

335
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,440
activism plus 222 percent information

336
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,110
workers

337
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,850
so that  the military part to

338
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,120
be clear plus 207 percent espionage

339
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,790
has always remained low but because

340
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,700
because the objective of espionage is to

341
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,470
remain secret if I carry out

342
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,940
an espionage operation it is

343
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,709
technically said that an

344
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:08,760
espionage operation is an

345
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,740
intelligence operation as it is called  today if

346
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,209
two people know it is no longer an

347
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,380
intelligence operation

348
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,329
so secrecy is the

349
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:18,300
fundamental thing and consequently it is normal

350
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,990
that espionage is known not to be easily

351
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,790
recognizable because it has in the DNA

352
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,740
of the operation the fact that it remains as

353
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,480
secret as

354
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,980
possible today.  through technologies and

355
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,019
we often call them apt advanced persistent

356
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,079
th  so in any case you see

357
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,730
2012 2013 a

358
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,220
little bit more there has been back to

359
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,870
grow I don't know what the new data are the

360
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,940
latest that andrea but I guess

361
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,860
they are absolutely not comforting

362
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,719
aspect the microphone

363
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:58,090
we will see the data so far from the summits is

364
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:07,660
free then it will be  presented in March and of

365
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,800
course

366
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,790
remember that these public animals

367
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:20,380
just absolutely right so a whole

368
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,090
series of attacks is made different for

369
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,040
some more reason made

370
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,200
by the states and with the purpose of spirals

371
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,040
they never become absolutely so

372
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:41,410
this is very important because otherwise you

373
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,740
do not understand the difference

374
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,210
therefore espionage is the tip of the tip of the

375
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,920
iceberg for the

376
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,420
reasons we have said

377
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,680
in brackets I noticed very

378
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,170
interesting between 2014 and 2015

379
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,210
also look at how cyber attacks

380
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,250
are also following the fashions in

381
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,590
quotation marks so you see that automotive was recently born

382
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,180


383
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,160
so slow technology has suddenly

384
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,900
entered cars

385
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,060
you in one year plus 66.67

386
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,720
percent chemical attacks on medical

387
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,260
chimicals there is everything cloud services

388
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,140
obviously news entertainment banking

389
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,730
and finance etcetera

390
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,320
etcetera on which however I like to

391
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,570
deepen exactly this at the beginning

392
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,590


393
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,690
and I like to do it with this  introduction

394
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,250
I always use this slide when I talk about

395
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,190
espionage because it is an

396
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,730
oxymoron so a spy actually

397
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,560
goes around with a tag that says

398
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,410
hello I am a spy because I use

399
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,420
this slide because in my opinion we have to

400
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,490
speak very clearly about

401
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,100
espionage and we have to do it

402
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,970
as closely as possible to what

403
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,950
we poor citizens who can

404
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,080
study or can see through

405
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,930
open sources it is important to talk about

406
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,390
espionage for this reason here

407
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,690
because espionage has always been,

408
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,640
not since technologies have

409
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,270
always been

410
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,790
one of the best tools and  most

411
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,010
effective to get in wartime

412
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,130
but especially in peacetime from

413
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,980
nemi  but above all as friends and therefore as

414
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,350
allies political military

415
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,990
economic advantages towards any

416
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,020
other subject has always worked

417
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,180
so technologies are a further

418
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,860
tool that greatly facilitates

419
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,810
this kind of activity

420
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,230
but espionage even exists if

421
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,660
there are not precisely historical recourses

422
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,340
however, the end of the time of the

423
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,320
Sumerians can be traced back so

424
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,080
let's say that it has existed for quite a

425
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,270
lot of years any prime minister of

426
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,790
any state is interested in knowing

427
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,570
what his counterpart is doing on a

428
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,780
geopolitical level in economic

429
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,020
military financial military had

430
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,090
said  politics etc. etc. it is

431
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,350
absolutely normal

432
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,830
and clear that for these four reasons

433
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,420
we have completely digitized the

434
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,530
information

435
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,630
today you can teach me and

436
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,959
digitized not only the text written

437
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,880
in word and no longer with the

438
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,589
typewriter I am 37 years old so I

439
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,770
used it alas  we have digitized

440
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,690
everything we have digitized  our

441
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,310
life we digitized the voice

442
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,720
because the voice the voice is not a

443
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,910
sandwich and it is a given at this moment the

444
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,190
geographical position the tastes

445
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,020
anything is digitized so we

446
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,720
digitized everything we centered

447
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,960
the information I remember that when

448
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,820
I was a boy

449
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,160
c  'they were big computers like in

450
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,290
this room then they got

451
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,720
smaller and smaller then we

452
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,340
used the cassettes then we

453
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,680
started using the

454
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,480
four and a half floppies then the three and a

455
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,370
half floppies the smaller ones in the cd rom the

456
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,260
usb sticks now the  cloud therefore

457
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,030
we also lose contact in quotation marks

458
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,430
with the information we do not know more

459
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,280
or less more where physically

460
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,610
the information

461
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,560
I am a lawyer in this sector

462
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,880
within the contracts and

463
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,430
cloud services I often read about the things they

464
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,250
put me they make him put  hands in

465
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,790
hair because many times companies

466
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,260
that also buy cloud services

467
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,360
do not even bother to know where it

468
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:16,940
is going  nno to

469
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,710
finish information and if they know by

470
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,940
mistake where the information ends up

471
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,470
they do not know where it

472
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,020
ends up backup of that information and

473
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,120
then we complain that for example on the

474
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,410
question of winding it came out

475
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,770
of the information that has given away from in

476
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,090
any  possible way

477
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,460
imaginable is legal and in some cases

478
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,320
at least documents and from what is

479
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,180
publicly read it also seems

480
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,860
illegal so we have

481
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,500
centralized them but not only have we also

482
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,240
dematerialized them we have lost

483
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,650
contact with information

484
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,300
we almost no longer have it on  'hard disk on

485
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,420
a USB pen then the awareness poor

486
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,190
perception of the dangers and more classic

487
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,680
than the classics and the anonymity which is still

488
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,480
for a little while the real problem of cyber

489
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,850
security and therefore we have great

490
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,860
difficulty in understanding who

491
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,620
actually is the real author of  an

492
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,200
attack of cybercrime as well

493
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,870
as activism and even more so

494
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,370
by state intelligence agencies

495
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,940
c  With their military activities

496
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,410
these four problems that

497
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,270
we still do not solve make me say that for

498
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,760
ten years now ten years now

499
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,910
electronic espionage has

500
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,920
been one of the main as

501
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,930
you read and most important threats to

502
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,490
national security and above all to

503
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,580
economic security  of every country because

504
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,160
all the states spy on all the states

505
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,470
have always inspired and all the states

506
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,170
want to continue spying believe that

507
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,000
the n 6 after the question of junction and

508
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,180
has stopped doing the n 6 no moreover

509
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,000
there was always the site  of the n 6 in

510
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,770
which it was clearly stated what the

511
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,340
n 6 does

512
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,520
you think that some other state that has

513
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,740
been in the few documented cases

514
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,960
discovered to do

515
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,680
espionage activities has caused a war no a war

516
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,280
has never broken out in the history of the world

517
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,680
for a

518
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,100
spying activity that has never been discovered

519
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,840
because once again every state knows

520
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,080
that he himself is the first to do that kind

521
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,870
of activity  Therefore, every spy state every

522
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,390
state has always spied and every state

523
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,820
wants to continue spying and you know

524
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,890
how to respond to espionage and therefore

525
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,090
as you can see, espionage has never

526
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,590
represented the triggering cause of a

527
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,960
conflict in a diplomatic way

528
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,890
therefore through targeted sanctions by

529
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,700
canceling for example  the

530
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,950
official visit happened the president the former

531
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,590
president now of brazil president to

532
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,090
be brazil canceled when

533
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,529
the scandal happened in the

534
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:44,000
official visit to the united states

535
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,330
of america or a very evident reaction

536
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,370
on the diplomatic level a head of

537
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,669
state canceling a trip  official

538
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:55,010
this is the answer in parentheses in terms

539
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,230
of international law there

540
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,990
is no rule that punishes

541
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,620
espionage

542
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,500
there is only one in an annex

543
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,679
to the 1949 Hague convention that

544
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,750
punishes the spy 1949 1949 that punishes the

545
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,210
spy when caught in the territory

546
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,490
of an enemy state and in any case the

547
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,799
problems are of the spy, not of the state

548
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,080
eg  r which the spy works

549
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,990
therefore the state for which the spy works

550
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,700
1949 so computers not even a little more

551
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,559
existed does not commit any offense

552
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,270
in terms of international law

553
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,370
because this is because once again

554
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,529
all states spy all states

555
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:35,419
have always spied and all states

556
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,880
they want to continue spying on the

557
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,919
actors who do great espionage activities

558
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,169


559
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:43,669
surely you have read about it

560
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,950
extensively china is one of these

561
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,429
actors

562
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:48,649
one of these actors who once again makes

563
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:51,470
this slide and a very

564
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,190
interesting slide because it then summarizes in a

565
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,289
single image what  that the reality

566
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:58,669
of the facts at least as far as we know

567
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:02,539
from sources from open sources so the

568
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:05,000
china the united states say through

569
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,770
the chinese government the chinese obviously

570
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,100
respond by saying that they are not groups

571
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,070
linked to their government except for a few

572
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,020
cases in which it has been able to prove  up

573
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,510
to now but a huge

574
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,529
spying activity to steal

575
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:24,409
as you see 13 cruz  hi tech secrets

576
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,020
so basically everything that is

577
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,330
patentable what is patented

578
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,880
new technologies steal this

579
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,789
kind of information and give it to

580
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:37,130
their private companies at least so

581
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:41,090
the narrative wants these private

582
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,930
Chinese companies what they do they

583
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,590
take what has been done by a

584
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,660
state  normally western or from the

585
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,310
united states of america which obviously is

586
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:53,370
part of the west and rebuild

587
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,130
and resell it on the western market and

588
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,560
here if you read the diatribe between the

589
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,060
united states and china on the

590
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,850
espionage issues on which the american government

591
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,930
stands up because the government  American

592
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,940
who then I will talk about

593
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,710
quickly but you all know

594
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,240
what happened with the slogan he says I do not

595
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,960
hide that through the n 6 I do

596
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,340
electronic espionage as

597
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,990
Italy does it as France

598
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,270
does it as Spain does it Ghana Australia  new

599
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,190
zealand the comoros islands etcetera

600
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,760
etcetera

601
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,650
i do not hide it absolutely but i

602
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,930
do business of  espionage for the

603
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,880
national security of the united states

604
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,570
of america

605
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,980
this is what the us government says

606
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,890
i do not do espionage to

607
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,880
steal secrets from another government from

608
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,950
there to my private companies making it

609
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,780
will produce less cost and obviously resell it

610
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,920
at a lower price

611
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,200
this is china and  for the

612
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,420
united states government if you read this is the

613
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,880
problem of the aggressive strategy

614
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,190
that china is using to

615
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,730
steal information i arrive

616
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,750
i end up concept i arrive and then

617
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:04,320
they basically say thank

618
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,170
you that you resell cheaper products on my market

619
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,240
because it is not invested  in

620
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,140
research and development

621
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,630
because as you know perfectly well when

622
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,310
what to do anything build

623
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,770
anything especially in

624
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,240
high technology and military high technology it

625
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,780
is clear that the largest

626
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,220
expenditure you have in research and development was

627
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,680
billions of dollars or euros

628
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,780
in research  and development when

629
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,520
I take them away from you it is normal that

630
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,560
you did not spend that money and it is

631
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,550
normal that then you

632
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:36,270
basically have the sources to

633
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:40,100
talk to us about the software or the

634
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,540
military aircraft you want to produce

635
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,890
it is no coincidence that I do this example

636
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,140
you have them ready produce them

637
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,210
directly there you produce a  lower cost

638
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,400
and then the problem is that he sells them to you

639
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,220
on my market at a lower price and therefore

640
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,279
I'm not there bernard

641
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,629
expects the microphone as if that is not

642
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:02,919
needed in the end how can you justify

643
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,470
malte go and gamal

644
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,159
beats go the lag and malt and bega  com

645
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:11,440
ok like two attacks that enel 6

646
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,539
made for national security since

647
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:14,559
it does not have two companies roque

648
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,070
absolutely then on the other

649
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,980
side I was saying

650
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,019
since then I come from I am called

651
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:25,239
stefano the american which seems because I

652
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,769
always do then  great publicity the

653
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:27,730
united states of america as

654
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,399
well as obviously my government so

655
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:31,600
i would like to be called stefano

656
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,850
the italian because stefano americano or

657
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,149
following the slide on the americans  ani then

658
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:39,730
actually from the revelations of snow

659
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,999
den it turns out that some

660
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,279
espionage activities presumably carried out by n

661
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,320
6 as well as

662
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,239
presumably also that of china

663
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:51,249
presumably in 6

664
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,789
actually went to hit companies and the

665
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:56,499
information that was collected

666
00:25:56,499 --> 00:25:57,909
was then given to  American companies

667
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:00,039
to participate it is not the case that

668
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:02,259
you said but I reconnect however

669
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:04,450
the example was that I am connected for

670
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,190
example of the president of Brazil

671
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,090
the president of Brazil did not

672
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,169
fulfill the official visit to the

673
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,389
United States of America because from the

674
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:15,100
junction papers  it emerged that the united states

675
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,320
of america through the n 6 had

676
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,350
stolen information on a contract in the

677
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,499
field of renewable energy so

678
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,210
how many offers had been made

679
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,549
by a brazilian company that produced

680
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:30,519
renewable energy

681
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,659
had been given this information had been given

682
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:33,249
to the

683
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:34,480
american companies of cannes and coincidentally

684
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,340
they had won the contract because it is normal

685
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,480
that if you are first the price

686
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,070
of the opponent fi just a little less than the

687
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,809
same services and actually solved

688
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,779
in this case it would be

689
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:45,519
further to say that even the

690
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,259
united states of america did not

691
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:49,090
behave according to the rules  that

692
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:49,749
all states

693
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:52,899
follow that is that as long as it is a matter

694
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:54,399
of espionage activities aimed at

695
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:55,359
national security

696
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:57,909
we all know that all states

697
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:01,720
do them at least obviously on the

698
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,070
geopolitical level that affects that

699
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,599
particular state Italy I do not

700
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,580
expect I do not know but in any case I do not

701
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,539
expect  that does

702
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:10,989
espionage towards the new zealand so to

703
00:27:10,989 --> 00:27:14,169
speak maybe australia does it because it

704
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:16,029
is in its geopolitical quadrant so

705
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:17,499
in that case also the united states

706
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:20,019
would have behaved in a way that

707
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:22,179
violates this regulation they wrote

708
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:25,779
between states in which the espionage oriented

709
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:27,940
national security  it is allowed and

710
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,440
so much so that there is no norm that

711
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,269
punishes the state that does it perc  hé everyone

712
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:33,309
does it but when instead you go to give

713
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:36,429
an advantage incorrectly to

714
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:38,409
private companies and then you act in

715
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:40,599
a way that violates these rules and

716
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,489
then we agree but beyond

717
00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:44,289
almost both the state speaks and I would say the

718
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:45,849
same  what if italy did it too

719
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:51,129
for the love of god andrea claudio chinese

720
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:53,349
the chinese the red laundry time i'm

721
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:57,809
here to pierce lockeed martin exact with

722
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,450
meg di rsa when they have taken all the

723
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:06,759
seeds you miss the togas they didn't want to

724
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:09,999
attack s al jazeerà  the intermediary to

725
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:11,739
attack lockheed martin who had

726
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:15,849
all the vpn of the engineers managed with the

727
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:17,830
dowry and then from there they entered

728
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,330
the lockheed martin system she

729
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,499
took the plans of the f 35 the other rolo

730
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:25,149
atypically the americans get pissed

731
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:27,879
when and not  there is clearly not

732
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:31,119
even a shadow of dual use technology that has

733
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,249
been found

734
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:36,539
i.e if you steal the new

735
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:42,009
cotton swab 2.0 patent they get pissed if you steal

736
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:45,369
plans of his 35 they are silent because

737
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:48,580
he does it because they or  then if you look it

738
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,739
could be a case of lev e 35 equal

739
00:28:50,739 --> 00:28:53,739
to the Chinese j 28, it just happens

740
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:55,809
that martina has been violated three times and

741
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:58,299
I always say by making a joke

742
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:00,159
since as you know the f35 had

743
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,929
problems when it came out which was

744
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:03,159
sent  in production with the

745
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,899
being flown had some problems not

746
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:06,159
indifferent to the software that manages

747
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,039
a specific part of the plane

748
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,409
I making a joke he says or maybe I

749
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:12,789
don't know there were the Chinese

750
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:14,649
I don't believe it I do like crozza it's not true

751
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:16,570
friends of china  it is not true I do not

752
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,270
believe it but reading what there is

753
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,590
on the internet the clubs is the first time

754
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,850
they took the sources from them the second time

755
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,470
they saw the updates the

756
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,020
third they stole some sources the cold

757
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,970
bug so that they had the

758
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,400
functional aircraft and then they did double

759
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,320
damage so not only did they steal them and

760
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,880
they sent research and development up in smoke

761
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,530
they also sent them to

762
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,049
send an airplane with problems to production

763
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:43,760
could  bbe also because you know

764
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,039
that the trend right now we

765
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:48,110
talk a lot about espionage is the

766
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,640
reason why I want to talk about

767
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,169
espionage the very often round talking

768
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:52,640
about espionage is exactly this

769
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,860
as I told you we have to talk about it because it is

770
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,809
normal for certain activities to

771
00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:58,549
happen because they are  always occurred and

772
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:01,909
will continue to happen and delimit

773
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:04,309
what is the limit between what states do even if

774
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:06,950
it is not written and they

775
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,480
all agree that what

776
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,600
must not be done is done but the evolution

777
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,789
of what is happening is  that not

778
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:16,520
only the information is subtracted from

779
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,260
the new trend in a

780
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,610
national security perspective that is

781
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,289
emerging and that will become more and

782
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:23,539
more evident in the coming years and that

783
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:25,220
the information is put back into

784
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,700
the valley decision-making cycle

785
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,559
so there is not only a

786
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,020
subtraction but a remission in the flow of

787
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,330
decision making and flawed information and

788
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,159
beware that it is not only below the point

789
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:39,590
of  view of the construction of technology

790
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,580
could be inside a

791
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,620
company of a company then

792
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,679
put back an information that given the

793
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,240
source it comes from

794
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,210
actually seems absolutely credible

795
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,960
but in reality it has been manipulated

796
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,679
quickly because time is

797
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:56,570
running out of hands and I would like to search  to

798
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,570
tell you more or less everything I also talk about

799
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,919
terrorism you hear about

800
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:02,990
cyberterrorism many times I don't

801
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,700
talk about cyber terrorism it is not

802
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,260
technically right to talk about

803
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,090
terrorism we must talk about and use

804
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,730
of technologies for terrorist purposes

805
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,679
cyberterrorism excuse me for

806
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:14,750
doing the  lawyer means to say it

807
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,669
greatly simplifies obtaining the

808
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:19,520
same damage as an attack that was

809
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,470
carried out in Nice in France we have

810
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,820
heard of it in all parts of the world

811
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,919
recently unfortunately with a cyber attack

812
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:25,610


813
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,220
this thing has never happened yet I

814
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,070
believe it will not happen yet for

815
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,659
a lot but in any case

816
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:34,909
instead what happens I vog you  I say

817
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:36,409
assuming that you do not already know it

818
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:39,229
since if the expert there is a

819
00:31:39,229 --> 00:31:41,869
huge use of technologies for terrorist purposes

820
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:43,070


821
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:46,330
what are the terrorist purposes

822
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,590
only these propaganda activities and we

823
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,389
have seen a lot of

824
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:55,460
proselytizing activities first phase of

825
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,049
indoctrination collection of

826
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:01,070
training funds or first phase of

827
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,809
training financing

828
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:04,070
of terrorist activity and

829
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,299
planning preparation and

830
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:06,590
coordination

831
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,239
these activities are those that are

832
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:10,849
actually carried out by the Islamic state at

833
00:32:10,849 --> 00:32:13,340
the moment all these activities

834
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,190
are not cyber terrorism they are a use

835
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,019
of technologies for terrorist purposes

836
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,080
that you look at and perhaps  even much more

837
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,509
important than the terrorist attack

838
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,369
itself because it is here that the terrorist attack is being prepared

839
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:26,599


840
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,519
and here that the

841
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:31,279
psychologically weaker or

842
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,639
psychologically oriented people are identified to do this

843
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:35,779
kind of activity

844
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,759
and here that they are radicalized

845
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,979
recruited radicalized incited it is here

846
00:32:39,979 --> 00:32:42,470
that  they are trained at the first level

847
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,269
but remember that then

848
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:46,399
at least this terrorist group

849
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,629
always does training on the territories

850
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:52,940
and here the financing of

851
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,919
terrorist activities takes place and you will tell me

852
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,779
why you are rightly experts

853
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:59,090
okay logo they do not have the

854
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,570
technical skills to  make a high-

855
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,059
level attack as israel did in 2007

856
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:07,429
as they did it say israel the

857
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:08,779
united states with stack set

858
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,960
as was done in december 2015

859
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,149
to two

860
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:15,649
power stations in ukraine

861
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:17,899
probably done by a state that

862
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:19,789
i may have a geopolitical interest in

863
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,399
turning off the power for some for

864
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,019
several

865
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:26,029
winter hours in ukraine right now

866
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:28,999
so i guess i don't believe it but

867
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:30,590
russia as the one that might

868
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,149
have more interest right now

869
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:34,369
as it is making a conflict more or

870
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:39,229
less  Obviously, however, be careful, someone

871
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:40,759
can tell me why someone told me,

872
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:42,529
especially in the armed forces sector  and

873
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:44,059
when I do training on these

874
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:45,030
subjects

875
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,590
eto'o it's fine they don't have the

876
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,510
skills but the software is bought we

877
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,310
don't all know that this organization

878
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:54,980
is financed by at least two very

879
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,420
rich states let's say it is very inclined to

880
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,870
give a lot of money and said it is

881
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,150
absolutely true you could buy

882
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,300
ready-made software in quotes also

883
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,639
of another profile to use them but I

884
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,949
am absolutely certain that they

885
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,440
would not be used I am absolutely

886
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,810
sure that you are a state financed as

887
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,940
some Islamic state finance the

888
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,440
Islamic state to buy

889
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,900
software the Islamic state would use

890
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,730
unfortunately that money to buy

891
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,699
Kalashnikov bombs etc.

892
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,150
etc.

893
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,400
a bit because it is culturally brought in

894
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,710
this sense a bit because what we

895
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,409
said before the cyber armies, even at

896
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,870
high level 1, you have to find them where you have to

897
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,489
know how to use three do a

898
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:41,280
very limited damage in time and  they make very

899
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,909
little noise in comparison to a cultured one  llo

900
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,199
from the kitchen

901
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,300
enters a church and unfortunately because

902
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,699
if an idiot slaughters a priest as it

903
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,560
happened a while ago and this

904
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,690
unfortunately anyone can do it any

905
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,159
crazy can do this activity

906
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,920
but this makes much more hype than

907
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,110
even a high level malware  level therefore

908
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,810
I am convinced that it is cyber terrorism

909
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,830
we will not see it and I say unfortunately because

910
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,540
precisely since it is a very limited damage

911
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,440
in time

912
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,700
I would hope that these people would

913
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,890
try to do this if they really have to

914
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:14,940
do this kind of

915
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,760
terrorist activity they did them on the web or

916
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,590
through the internet  rather

917
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,450
than killing people in the square,

918
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,640
however, I believe that we must

919
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,040
focus on this because this is the

920
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,600
battle territory at

921
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,550
least on the internet that we must

922
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:35,190
have with terrorist groups and

923
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,300
therefore I have always gone to

924
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,010
tell this not only in  so called

925
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,810
military training schools of

926
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,190
our armed forces but also at

927
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:44,310
born level where they honor me to be u  no among the

928
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,650
teachers at the NATO school

929
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,600
of counter-terrorism that in ankara

930
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,360
instambul so I go very often and on

931
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,869
one day this

932
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:54,660
happens that a French television

933
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,240
is turned off the attack

934
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,880
is claimed by the Islamic state

935
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,859
now it is definitely not a French television

936
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:03,519


937
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,259
I said  is turned off is not a

938
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:09,190
relevant attack from the point of view of

939
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,119
national security

940
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:12,099
but I am saying that they do not have

941
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:14,650
these computer skills they call

942
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,079
me and I say they saw a lawyer done the year the

943
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,940
frigate actually made an attack

944
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,289
that is not of the level of  national security level,

945
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:22,480
however, it seems to

946
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,609
be already an attack is interesting

947
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:26,069
because violating a

948
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:28,599
fairly important television in France and

949
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,249
turning it off completely is not an

950
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:31,720
attack that is done every day you

951
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,690
know that I and other analysts have

952
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,920
begun to think about how it was

953
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,539
possible who  was this champion

954
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:40,690
of the Islamic state because in reality there

955
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,119
was  only one of the

956
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,240
Islamic state champion who carried out

957
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,279
high-profile terrorist attacks and

958
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:51,099
took a missile last summer

959
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:54,789
from a government drone of which he

960
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:56,589
was a citizen of course to avoid

961
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,569
issues because he made a mistake by dint of

962
00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:00,249
communicating by dint of  communicate he was

963
00:37:00,249 --> 00:37:02,019
wrong to send a message they

964
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,119
tracked him down after a few minutes

965
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:07,269
the drone passed and annoyed her and then we

966
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:08,739
begin to think we begin to

967
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:10,809
think fi that talking to some

968
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:11,259
people

969
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:15,369
another person notices this screenshot

970
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:17,980
which then is what he knows how to solve the

971
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,720
problem it is known that there is this

972
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,980
journalist called david

973
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,589
dell'osso david I know I don't know

974
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:25,839
about the tv5 world news that the television he

975
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,720
loved I don't know if I still love to comment

976
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,029
every day on youtube the news of the

977
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:31,480
day

978
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,980
journalist also a lot  good a lot of

979
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,950
following watching tv they don't do

980
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,900
it we did it but looking at

981
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,170
his comments on the internet it turned out

982
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,390
what you see circled  in red

983
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,249
what you see look for the red on the piece of

984
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:47,440
paper written password under

985
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,309
password there is a series of strings

986
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,480
evidently someone from the Islamic state

987
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,430
was probably very passionate

988
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,039
about the French language he was

989
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,720
very passionate in very careful to

990
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,119
follow the news commented by this

991
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,369
david ellis on su  youtube and noticed

992
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:05,049
that it was written password

993
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,400
maybe he had a bit of

994
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,289
romantic competence said let's try to see if

995
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:09,609
that's what it says after password

996
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:11,799
works fine and I don't have the

997
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:14,170
administration step of the television systems

998
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:14,920


999
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,829
the television has been turned off

1000
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,299
security measures of this television were

1001
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:21,609
removed so there was no possibility

1002
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:24,279
to connect through a webcam to

1003
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:25,690
make these comments the reporter

1004
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,950
went to do it in the

1005
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,569
system administrator's room

1006
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:30,579
that's why there was this kind of

1007
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:32,880
information behind the camera

1008
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,529
so how  then you see even

1009
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:38,140
very simple attacks manage to get as

1010
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,349
always  very great very great effects

1011
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:45,760
I very quickly very quickly I

1012
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,099
go on to talk about the real warfare part

1013
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:49,180


1014
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,240
here too hear about cyberwar

1015
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,819
cyber war once again I do not

1016
00:38:54,819 --> 00:38:57,039
use the term cyberwar because it is a

1017
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,049
term in my opinion absolutely

1018
00:38:58,049 --> 00:39:01,180
incorrect because there is war under the

1019
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,529
point of  legal view

1020
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:05,410
obviously simplifying there must be two

1021
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,630
elements or someone dies through

1022
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,710
the attack

1023
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,510
or there are physically

1024
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,579
detectable and therefore physical damage to the

1025
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:15,490
infrastructures of a state then bridges

1026
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:19,450
schools hospitals society that was an

1027
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,010
electricity etc. etc. if

1028
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,569
there are physical damage to these

1029
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,059
structures yes  he can start talking about war

1030
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:27,520
until this stuff is not there I

1031
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,619
prefer to talk about cyber warfare

1032
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:31,260
warfare is a term in English that is

1033
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,460
difficult to translate into Italian

1034
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,079
but we can translate it with

1035
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:37,079
conflictuality therefore

1036
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:40,299
conflicting activities between states and

1037
00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:41,859
cyber warfare

1038
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:43,930
activities statins  they begin to do n  and they have been doing it for a

1039
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,049
long time and they are doing more and more and I

1040
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:49,210
have to be honest for some time now

1041
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:53,410
they are starting to do it

1042
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,069
in a very very evident way

1043
00:39:57,069 --> 00:39:59,020
and you know what, for example, the

1044
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,220
same can be highlighted even in

1045
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,319
an increasingly less timid way

1046
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:06,299
look at this doctrine of the pentagon

1047
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:08,349
the pentagon are the american armed forces

1048
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:09,089


1049
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:12,460
to be clear a doctrine of the 2013

1050
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,529
of the pentagon which is called cyber space

1051
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:17,550
operations therefore military operations

1052
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,740
in cyber in and through the always

1053
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,880
space so as far as here I am

1054
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,860
specific but you have it  also said before

1055
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,990
at this time the space server acts

1056
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,610
as a facilitator of attacks and

1057
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,830
traditional disability controls of

1058
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,040
the airspace and send the planes to

1059
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,620
bomb or disability to Czech

1060
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,900
of the ships and send the submarine

1061
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,550
to blow it up or send a torpedo

1062
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,470
to blow it up  air, however much

1063
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,420
this is the role

1064
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,180
of cyberspace in the perspective of

1065
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,650
military conflicts between states, it is

1066
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,480
clear that  we notice more

1067
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,420
and more that actually even in a way

1068
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,740
quite past me the term

1069
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,620
shameless states are

1070
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,540
more and more clearly putting pen to

1071
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,370
paper in the official doctrines that they then

1072
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,410
release on the internet that we are

1073
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:08,820
going towards cyber cyber activity

1074
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,070
and calls it our law the

1075
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:14,280
Monti decree of 2013 offensive therefore of

1076
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,030
military offensive attack on

1077
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,340
another state and this doctrine of the

1078
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,920
pentagon in 2013 defines them in

1079
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,170
a specific way defines exploitation

1080
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,150
therefore espionage defines cyber

1081
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:31,470
defense or cd and that's okay and also defines

1082
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,190
the o co

1083
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,350
therefore the offensive cyber operations

1084
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,950
therefore  offensive activities that is

1085
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,510
conflictuality bar real war

1086
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,370
then because at the moment in which I

1087
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,980
identify that a state with its

1088
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,150
military troops

1089
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,380
the United States has the cyber command

1090
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,710
since 2009 it makes a cyber attack on

1091
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,430
another state

1092
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,820
we are talking about war in the moment

1093
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,560
in which I attribute this kind of

1094
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,310
attack

1095
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,900
par  the United States I can I could

1096
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,460
also talk about Italy which is

1097
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,250
constituting the cyber command in

1098
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,810
this period and in a while we will hear

1099
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,380
about

1100
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,770
what they are are activities aimed at

1101
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:10,100
degrading, damaging or

1102
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,110
destroying access, the functioning or the

1103
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,120
availability of the  a

1104
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,610
target at a level and for a

1105
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,490
fixed period of time

1106
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,300
therefore seems gloomy of the species of

1107
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,670
cruise missiles sent for a certain

1108
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,550
period of time to solve a

1109
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,000
problem perceived by the government which

1110
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,770
relaunches the aim is obviously to

1111
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,230
project force in and through the

1112
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,760
space is needed one thing that has

1113
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,040
left me a bit perplexed is that this

1114
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,790
kind of activity

1115
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,660
must rightly be individually

1116
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,680
authorized by the president of the

1117
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,510
united states at least as regards while

1118
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,670
the united states of america but it is written

1119
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,170
in the doctrine that the only  possible

1120
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,290
direct target of the attack must

1121
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,920
be a military target as you know

1122
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,600
at present ob  military officers

1123
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,400
very often use

1124
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,980
private technology banality cell phones

1125
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,530
to scream for the military I think he is a

1126
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,590
manager like the ones we use

1127
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,460
absolutely in a normal way so

1128
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,110
the primary objective is a

1129
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:17,540
military objective and the acts will have to go and

1130
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,010
give a moment hoping that it does not happen

1131
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,660
obviously war conflicts are

1132
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,490
never a positive thing at least in my

1133
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,200
opinion, however, we will play a

1134
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,830
lot of attention because

1135
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,230
and here it is very interesting because we

1136
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,030
have talked about it for many years

1137
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,580
with public andrea and with other bodies they

1138
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,830
must also those that come but the

1139
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,800
defense  cyber space operations and that's

1140
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,410
fine but defense 76 would

1141
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,620
often be operation responsa mentally instill they

1142
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,730
are what we

1143
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,910
called i am here i miss them i'm

1144
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:54,530
talking for 15 minutes thanks the

1145
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,480
defensives if you had

1146
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,360
responsab they are those of cra only the

1147
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,710
defense we have  called for

1148
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,340
many years

1149
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,220
so while they are attacking me  I do and the

1150
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,020
best time you technicians teach me

1151
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,940
to understand who is attacking me provided

1152
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,960
that he has the skills and the

1153
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,700
possibilities and therefore I make an

1154
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,360
attack at the same time as the moment

1155
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,010
in which I suffer the one to try to

1156
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,130
understand or to degrade and damage or

1157
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:22,850
destroy  computer science the source

1158
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,200
of the attack itself

1159
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,820
these are very very interesting

1160
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,970
because in any case you see they

1161
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,230
actively degrade to the abilities of an

1162
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,940
adversary in which both attacks are

1163
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,310
imminent, also or in progress,

1164
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:35,600
attention from the legal point of view

1165
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,990
imminent is a huge problem because yes

1166
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:42,380
call anticipators server strike in

1167
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,140
this case that is I anticipate the attack

1168
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,760
because I'm sure you are going to

1169
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,260
attack me this is very delicate very

1170
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,720
delicate so much so that there is

1171
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,550
no norm there are norms that

1172
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:59,150
provide for activities that have never been

1173
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:04,370
used in history  so it is and I believe

1174
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,300
instead that they will be used a

1175
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,030
lot in the server space and it is very

1176
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,280
very relevant  this kind of

1177
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,170
activity and

1178
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,700
this kind of attack is very very delicate because I then

1179
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,250
have to prove to

1180
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,810
the United Nations Security Council so not to the

1181
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:21,070
last arrived that I had the

1182
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,290
detailed and specific evidence that it is a

1183
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,230
high-scale cyber attack

1184
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,850
was about to  be carried out against my

1185
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,110
critical infrastructures I have been an

1186
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,730
opponent and therefore I am an

1187
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,920
anticipator I had to anticipate

1188
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,140
the attack to prevent the attack from being made to me

1189
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:36,820


1190
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,610
so imminence is a principle that is

1191
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,140
also inside the

1192
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:44,020
United Nations charter so  they are all activities

1193
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,610
that from the point of view of

1194
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,350
international law do not worry I am not

1195
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,730
bored with the question of law

1196
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:50,200
can be classified as use

1197
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,440
of force and therefore there is a response

1198
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,650
from the state which is then of conflict

1199
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:58,960
so they are very very  delicate but

1200
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,120
beware not only the united states

1201
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,880
of america are going

1202
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,310
so clearly in theirs  doctrines but also

1203
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:09,340
in their actions towards

1204
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,740
cyber attack offensive for

1205
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,480


1206
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,320
military purposes iran iran is a power I believe at

1207
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,270
the moment it is the strongest

1208
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:23,230
growing power on the geopolitical level cyber in

1209
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,730
quotation marks but here too we must

1210
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,680
frame it correctly

1211
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,920
Iran has as its purpose think a bit it does

1212
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,240
not take us that you would never believe it

1213
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,490
proline but as its main purpose is

1214
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,440
to be recognized as a

1215
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,200
regional power in its geopolitical quadrant,

1216
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,820
therefore in the lower right

1217
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,800
corner of the United States of America which is the only one

1218
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,260
global world power is

1219
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:49,800
therefore called Milan does a lot of activities

1220
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,570
also on a geopolitical level but in

1221
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,190
reality all the activities that

1222
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,780
aim to be recognized as

1223
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,220
strengthening newspaper by the

1224
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,540
United States of America so that the

1225
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,280
United States of America sits at the  negotiating table

1226
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:00,880


1227
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,430
as they did and maybe they make

1228
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,600
agreements for example on the

1229
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,870
enrichment of uranium as they then have  so

1230
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:10,360
keep in mind that iran actually wants to

1231
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,820
hit on its

1232
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,220
geopolitical quadrant so all

1233
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,740
those countries linked to saudi

1234
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,680
arabia al qatar or all pro ri adrian countries

1235
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,390
of the capital of saudi arabia

1236
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,250
that is its goal and it is  for

1237
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,040
this reason it is said that shumov was

1238
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,320
just a cyber attack against sage

1239
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,310
ramco so the company that extracts

1240
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,450
hydrocarbons for saudi arabia

1241
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:37,240
just brought from iran iran has invested

1242
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,370
since 2009 in these capacities then

1243
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,500
strangely after stuxnet in 2010 there

1244
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,000
they rightfully threw down a lot

1245
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,530
of money after they saw the

1246
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:45,930
potential and suffered it

1247
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,610
through the stuxnet attack and in

1248
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:50,430
2011 they have allocated more than a billion

1249
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:54,990
since 2013 in sanremo which is the president

1250
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:57,580
of iran greatly accelerated in

1251
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,350
this sector

1252
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,640
and  here then I will give you a whole

1253
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,750
discussion and on what could

1254
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,400
happen currently because I do not know if

1255
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,960
you know

1256
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,450
the diploma relationships have been interrupted again  tici between Iran and the

1257
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:10,030
Arab emirates and in my opinion right in the

1258
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,740
necessary space is being played by

1259
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,750
Iran a huge

1260
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,300
attack activity against at this moment

1261
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,940
against this kind of states so

1262
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,700
in the course of 2015 as I write, Iran has

1263
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,440
used several times  this kind of

1264
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,710
activity and iran represents the

1265
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,630
emerging state with the most relevant and rapid

1266
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,130
growth in this

1267
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,800
sector iran to asymmetrical war that is

1268
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,990
this kind of activity but also

1269
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:36,370
terrorism guerrillas etc.

1270
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:38,710
etc. as an element inserted

1271
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:41,260
within its doctrine

1272
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,980
so it has

1273
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,020
also very clearly incorporated this kind of

1274
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:51,670
activity China China just in December of

1275
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,680
last year immediately after I had

1276
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,510
published a paper that maps the whole

1277
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,760
Chinese structure in a way

1278
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,350
of spying on military espionage has it

1279
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,460
changed

1280
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,990
so I was also very lucky

1281
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:03,910
in quotes to have done a great

1282
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:06,160
study job and then it really is

1283
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:06,670


1284
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,650
what they did has changed and this is another

1285
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:11,350
very very interesting trend that

1286
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,390
here you who are technicians I think

1287
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:17,200
you can appreciate even more

1288
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,310
what he did he created he

1289
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:20,230
restructured the whole military part and

1290
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,030
he created three structures llarme leading

1291
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:24,100
morgan la roquette perhaps the strategic

1292
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,810
gustatory perhaps the one we are interested in is the

1293
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,300
third the strategic gustatory force and you see

1294
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,830
what they have

1295
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:33,280
obviously done according to some sources the

1296
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,650
sap of force strategy has been put in

1297
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:38,410
one place and three branches have been created

1298
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:40,180
in this  single

1299
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:43,510
place and are deputed to

1300
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:45,619
military and intelligence operations

1301
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:48,380
both defensive and offensive in and

1302
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,819
through cyberspace therefore they have

1303
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:52,880
enclosed in a single command line and

1304
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,890
in a single place both the

1305
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,359
military activity and the intelligence activity

1306
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:58,220
both defensive and offensive

1307
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,490
then  they put inside

1308
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,980
the surveillance activity of the

1309
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,809
satellites talking in the car and the third

1310
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:09,559
finally  electronic warfare both defensive

1311
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:12,019
and offensive that is to are enclosing

1312
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:14,180
under the only command line and also

1313
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,579
physically in the same place because

1314
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:19,130
because fast the attack because you can not

1315
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,609
call have the authorization

1316
00:50:21,609 --> 00:50:23,480
check there is here humans

1317
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,069
will go more and more  have a

1318
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:27,769
marginal role in these sectors cyberspace

1319
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:30,349
space electronic warfare so

1320
00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:32,329
they began to put them in a single

1321
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,130
building under a single command line

1322
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,410
then leaner activities and all of

1323
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:37,190
them together

1324
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:39,470
North Korea has done the same

1325
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,660
thing will be simplified because it imagines

1326
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,430
having very little time did

1327
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:45,109
exactly the same thing

1328
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:47,779
north korea from china north korea but

1329
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:50,329
beware in my opinion we are not

1330
00:50:50,329 --> 00:50:53,059
fighting it well north korea has

1331
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:56,269
always done activities that are at an

1332
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:58,910
attack level that can be

1333
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:01,130
classified as  annoyance here you have

1334
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,079
also heard on some newscasts

1335
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:06,220
blows the bowler hat to nuclear tests a

1336
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,569
few meters or  Beyond the border line

1337
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:10,910
of national waters so that they

1338
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,880
begin to say eh but you have come out

1339
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,130
a bit rightly that is they try to

1340
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:19,640
keep it but you are

1341
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,150
careful not to make such important attacks far beyond

1342
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,710
international regulations because you know

1343
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,180
perfectly well

1344
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,089
born or any other country  can

1345
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:31,400
erase that country more so if

1346
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,480
we talk about born the united states

1347
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,799
of america in the space of a week

1348
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,410
so they look at this kind of

1349
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:39,019
attack slightly beyond the threshold

1350
00:51:39,019 --> 00:51:42,019
of the permit to annoy and then

1351
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:45,440
do the parades with nuclear missiles

1352
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,289
once  per year etc. etc. they

1353
00:51:48,289 --> 00:51:50,119
do it and we oppose them from

1354
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:52,009
this point of view that is the

1355
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:54,200
united nations constantly every time

1356
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,150
this happens publicly they come out with

1357
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,600
a

1358
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,360
proclamation that condemns this kind of

1359
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,830
activity recalls the norms of

1360
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:02,640


1361
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,070
perfect international law in cyberspace

1362
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:06,930
north korea  has been doing the same thing for

1363
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:09,270
some time now sony

1364
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,650
io non attack  i know is what i said

1365
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:12,210
last year if it was actually

1366
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:13,770
from north korea as the united states

1367
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,180
say and i don't even want to know

1368
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:19,320
but there we notice and you notice a year you

1369
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,060
notice a huge amount of

1370
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,220
cyber attacks that go more and more  the

1371
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,580
in the threshold of the permit therefore

1372
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,290
disturbing in quotation marks more and more

1373
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:30,840
increase more and more the level of

1374
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,360
capacity to be accomplished to be

1375
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,820
implemented therefore they improve more

1376
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,580
and more and make harsh more virtual damages end

1377
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,200
now up to this moment no in

1378
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,850
this kind of attacks not  we are

1379
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:43,380
opposing them so we are not

1380
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,480
publicly condemning them except for the

1381
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,630
sony case and what are we the mistake we

1382
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,490
are making which is that they are

1383
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:53,360
learning more and more to do

1384
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,670
cyberattacks king of

1385
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,590
intelligence because as you know in

1386
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,360
this sector there are no polygons of

1387
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:00,750
shooting

1388
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,370
then military you can not send them to

1389
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:04,890
train to shoot somewhere

1390
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,900
to learn how to make an infor attack

1391
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,040


1392
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,200
so to learn how to do cyber

1393
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,390
intelligence and cyberwarfare you have to do you

1394
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,220
need cyberwarfare intelligence against

1395
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:18,180
a target and you have to learn wrongly

1396
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,680
we do not fight them they are

1397
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,170
learning quickly how to do them they are

1398
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,390
raising the level more and more they

1399
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:26,130
see that we are not interested in

1400
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:27,810
it and  therefore they move the

1401
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,970
bar further and further if we do not oppose them

1402
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:32,250
and you see put orange in

1403
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,120
these actions increase both in terms

1404
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,560
of intensity and above all of

1405
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:34,950
quality

1406
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,770
this will happen in a while and

1407
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:39,450
North Korea in recent years has grown a

1408
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:42,840
lot and therefore it is  another and I go

1409
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,580
to the conclusion and another nation that

1410
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:50,040
develops in fan or with sense the cyber

1411
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,900
operation for some time but then I right

1412
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,820
well the united states is the united states

1413
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:57,060
and the performance of doing it offensive is

1414
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,920
china a beautiful china and  north korea

1415
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,350
and iran is fine yes but they have been that they

1416
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:04,100
can stay apart no

1417
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,110
it is not true united kingdom until some

1418
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:07,430
time was in the uni  one European

1419
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:09,380
so I was also saying a country of the

1420
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,570
European Union will actually stay there for a

1421
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:13,730
few more years despite break sit the

1422
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,030
united kingdom on 23 November 2015

1423
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:18,770
published the strategic defense and

1424
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:19,850
security review that the

1425
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:22,430
most important military strategic document that

1426
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:24,890
makes a planning from  here at 5 years

1427
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,420
what does this document very succinctly say

1428
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,970
that the kingdom the

1429
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:31,310
english government is developing the armed forces

1430
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,600
sorry the english government is

1431
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,350
developing advanced military offensive

1432
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:38,780
capabilities in and through cyberspace

1433
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,520
now i am a lawyer words are

1434
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,740
important if you me  write

1435
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,480
advanced offensive military capabilities

1436
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,100
I understand that the basic ones you already

1437
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,590
have are in fact absolutely so

1438
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:51,410
the capabilities united kingdom with the gc of the

1439
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:54,680
blind which is what ln 6 for the

1440
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,300
united states of america does an excellent

1441
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,130
level of electronic espionage the

1442
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,050
armed forces  Brits do a very good

1443
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:02,480
level of cyber warfare and what

1444
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,130
they have done within the national

1445
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:07,820
without the cyber program they have

1446
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,370
once again centralized military and intelligence

1447
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:11,990
both defensive and offensive

1448
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,850
more or less in the same

1449
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,580
place so even a european country has

1450
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:20,360
done this denmark since when i

1451
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,130
heard it i was a bit disconcerted it

1452
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:25,610
is developing offensive activities

1453
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,170
all countries are starting to develop

1454
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,660
offensive activities so we are

1455
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:35,560
indisputably going underneath to

1456
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,120
discuss unquestionably going

1457
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:42,020
towards this towards governments that arm themselves

1458
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:45,260
in quotes here acquire who is

1459
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:50,350
hello someone skype say hello to me

1460
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,820
then that arm themselves in quotes

1461
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,650
then acquire malware trojan

1462
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:57,890
software  to do espionage it's okay but it

1463
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,660
's okay within the limits that we said

1464
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,370
to ourselves to create real conflicts

1465
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:03,440
for war in quotation marks maybe

1466
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,720
tomorrow in and through cyberspace

1467
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,450
in europe in the united states of america in the

1468
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,760
east in the far east and then the

1469
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,950
far east  with china, japan a deed

1470
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:15,080
is an author  and the balancing of the far east is a very important player at the

1471
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,880
moment like

1472
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,300
milan

1473
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,760
and therefore

1474
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,040
in the far east to counter china it

1475
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,840
is obviously there are governments that

1476
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,760
also support the development of

1477
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,140
japan from this point of view

1478
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:30,110
so we are always going  under

1479
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,030
this on this topic

1480
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,650
now I then have five minutes and I had given you

1481
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:36,470
an example in the Ukrainian Russia conflict

1482
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:36,970


1483
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:39,070
of what is

1484
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:42,200
actually being done because we always hear

1485
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,390
about war war cyberwar war

1486
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:46,130
between Russia and Ukraine

1487
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:47,960
we have heard a lot about what

1488
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,330
did russia against

1489
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,800
ukraine you all remember it in maidan square

1490
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,470
at the beginning a text message on all the mobile phones

1491
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:56,660
of those who were in maidan square

1492
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,610
where it was written you are participating in

1493
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:03,890
a demonstration not

1494
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:05,450
authorized by your  government returns home

1495
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:07,190
all those who have not received

1496
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,680
this text message and cyberworld but no it is

1497
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,470
propaganda it is an

1498
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:16,280
absolutely normal activity but it does  tta

1499
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,490
through technologies during the

1500
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,560
voting activities in the port of

1501
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,480
sebastopol in crimea when the crime

1502
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,220
had to decide which side to be on

1503
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,650
the russian ships that were in the port

1504
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:30,830
began to jam constantly on

1505
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,410
all over the entire

1506
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:34,610
electromagnetic spectrum so

1507
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:36,500
cell phones no longer worked.  body and

1508
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,660
cyber war worked but 9 activities of

1509
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:41,020
electron jamming warfare of the most classic

1510
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:44,480
profit in telecom they cut the

1511
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,790
cables no longer gave the internet and cyber war

1512
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,680
no longer went with pincers they

1513
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,630
cut the cables and no longer

1514
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,730
did 42 attacks  of money service

1515
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:54,080
distributed on the day of voting

1516
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,600
with peaks 98 gigabit per second

1517
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,580
here the shoah judge for you if it is good it

1518
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,290
may not good I believe that

1519
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:03,850
even better can be done so but why

1520
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:06,560
therefore we are not faced with acts

1521
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,570
of cyber warfare  least of all

1522
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:11,330
cyberwar activities because

1523
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:13,400
surely ukraine why surely sorry

1524
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,210
we are not in 2007 when they say  o

1525
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:20,120
russia started with the

1526
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,250
distributed denial service attack against

1527
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,130
tallin estonia and for days I completely knock down

1528
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,590
all the

1529
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:28,880
estonian public administration services

1530
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,280
leaving the poor estonians

1531
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,230
absolutely without any

1532
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:34,330
service we are no longer in 2007

1533
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:35,650
although there is not yet  the

1534
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:38,170
werne screens i would hope i would hope to find not

1535
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:39,850
only in italy but in general

1536
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,850
abroad we are however no longer in

1537
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,340
2007 the ukrainian technological infrastructure

1538
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,560
however reported there is quite

1539
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,040
complex it is not easy to throw

1540
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,750
down ukraine they just have not really are not

1541
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,280
exactly first hair  under this

1542
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,960
sector you know perfectly well that

1543
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,970
most of the cybercrime marble

1544
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,410
tells me that it is also produced in

1545
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,770
those parts so in short, russia is

1546
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,480
certainly a more vulnerable target than

1547
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,430
the ukraine which has little

1548
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:08,290
technological infrastructure central russia

1549
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:09,280
for gas extraction

1550
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,950
so it is a  elephant russia in

1551
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,690
comparison to ukraine by being

1552
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,490
hit wide  computer scientist and therefore

1553
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:18,270
consequently russia did not want to

1554
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:20,560
wake up the sleeping dog and then

1555
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,960
russia had better windows of opportunity

1556
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,640
through the rifles

1557
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,440
through the ships in the port of sebastopol

1558
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,600
so it did not use this kind

1559
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,210
of activity

1560
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:32,770
and in fact I was denied the

1561
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,290
December 23, 2015 when they say

1562
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:38,020
russia once again I guess

1563
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,690
it could have been russia but

1564
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:42,580
I don't

1565
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:46,090
believe someone has made a cyber attack on

1566
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:48,880
these two Ukrainian energy companies

1567
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,570
I don't read the name because it's impossible

1568
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:55,510
and obviously it has turned off  7 a has

1569
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,100
inhibited the supply of

1570
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:02,980
electricity to a 250 thousand people in south-

1571
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:06,760
eastern ukraine in the winter because you

1572
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,170
don't think about electricity as they

1573
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:09,460
can't recharge your cellphone

1574
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,290
think about electricity with me I

1575
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:14,860
don't know how to heat  the winter in

1576
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:18,160
those parts is not exactly the mildest

1577
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,750
in ukraine

1578
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:22,090
think about the damage to the population in

1579
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:24,010
this case the software that was

1580
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:26,470
used  If one actually tried

1581
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:28,540
the connection of a state with that

1582
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:29,980
software to do this kind of

1583
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,050
activity, given that it reflected as an

1584
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:35,830
attack on citizens and therefore on the

1585
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:37,300
population, therefore exiting the

1586
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,950
virtual world, it could be classified

1587
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:41,110
as an act or use of force on the

1588
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,289
level of the  international law

1589
01:00:42,289 --> 01:00:43,880
therefore we could find ourselves in front of

1590
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,369
a second cyber weapon so this in

1591
01:00:46,369 --> 01:00:49,249
any case is the trend

1592
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:52,339
I have concluded I leave you with this

1593
01:00:52,339 --> 01:00:54,739
cartoon that has never made you smile and I

1594
01:00:54,739 --> 01:00:56,569
always use to conclude by

1595
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,279
thanking you for the attention I do not know

1596
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:01,099
if ours  future war stories

1597
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:03,890
will be like this that is of this veteran,

1598
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:06,559
this war veteran grandfather in which he

1599
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,809
tells his grandchildren in which of the

1600
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:11,689
time they entered a

1601
01:01:11,689 --> 01:01:13,489
Chinese firewall when the routers at a

1602
01:01:13,489 --> 01:01:15,589
certain point turned on and there were

1603
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:17,719
botnet on the right and trojans on the

1604
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:19,369
left is that day I had lost a

1605
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:21,140
lot of servers I don't know if

1606
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:22,669
these will actually be the stories  and of

1607
01:01:22,669 --> 01:01:25,279
war that we will tell our grandchildren

1608
01:01:25,279 --> 01:01:27,349
I do not think we have to wait in

1609
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:30,079
my opinion at least 15 20 more years to

1610
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,009
tell about real cyberwar

1611
01:01:34,009 --> 01:01:36,529
for each case she is nice and each case

1612
01:01:36,529 --> 01:01:39,380
tries to leave

1613
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:41,059
what we talked about today and what

1614
01:01:41,059 --> 01:01:42,709
then it would like to be the

1615
01:01:42,709 --> 01:01:44,319
main message that I would like to leave to you

1616
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,669
that the matter you do because

1617
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:48,079
most of you are computer scientists and

1618
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,799
very very relevant is very important

1619
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:54,979
and very much attention from the

1620
01:01:54,979 --> 01:01:56,929
Italian government but from European governments and from

1621
01:01:56,929 --> 01:01:59,059
all over the world because

1622
01:01:59,059 --> 01:02:00,289
more and more are going to do not

1623
01:02:00,289 --> 01:02:02,599
only electronic espionage and this

1624
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:05,749
maybe the thing is even more obvious but they

1625
01:02:05,749 --> 01:02:06,880
are increasingly making

1626
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,659
conflicts through technologies

1627
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:11,509
and the internet so

1628
01:02:11,509 --> 01:02:12,949
pay great attention when you hear about

1629
01:02:12,949 --> 01:02:16,039
great reflection on

1630
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:18,619
what  actually speaking of cyber

1631
01:02:18,619 --> 01:02:19,400
warfare is what actually

1632
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,799
speaking of oneself for intelligen  I

1633
01:02:21,799 --> 01:02:23,689
thank you for your attention

1634
01:02:23,689 --> 01:02:25,459
if you have any questions you

1635
01:02:25,459 --> 01:02:30,319


1636
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:32,119


1637
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:34,039
can kill them or or put stefano mele on google I am not the snacks companion of pacciani who homonymous are the other

1638
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:37,179
thank you very much
