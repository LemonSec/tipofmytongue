1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,450
and let's go

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,270
good evening everyone and my name is amore

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,019
lanzani tonight I will try to give a

4
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:11,519
little talk on what social

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,500
engineering in Italy is business to

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,299
business that is what are the activities that

7
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,850
can really be done in Italy and

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,270
then in Europe consequently in the  'field

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,670
of social engineering since the

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,019
first time I come to the East I

11
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,939
prepared a small presentation of

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,570
who I am when I am I work in

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,219
Schiller I am the author of iso 27001

14
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,930
on inter jurisprudence every other day

15
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,380


16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,630
I hope to graduate sooner or later there are

17
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,340
six missing  exams and martial arts enthusiast the

18
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,489
one there instead my profile

19
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:42,930
which should be telegram if you want to

20
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,410
write me dirty messages what is

21
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,129
social engineering then the

22
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:51,660
definition

23
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,520
I have to move more than here to and I

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,670
discover people see there are 500 thousand

25
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,050
different definitions of social

26
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,340
engineering that you can find on the web

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,800
in all the manuals that you find the

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,809
main speech simple from the

29
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,369
study of behaviors i  ndividual a

30
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,080
person in order to understand

31
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,479
useful information if the social component is missing

32
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,310
as the

33
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,290
word says it is not social engineering if

34
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,159
the activity of another type

35
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,979
the question is who are the

36
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,030
social engineers who want to steal

37
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,670
information from us

38
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,900
the scheme is always the same

39
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,520
activists criminal organization

40
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,750
journalists who need to

41
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,150
retrieve information my relatives

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,340
in north africa to competitors races the

43
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,850
cops before getting to the whole

44
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,320
legal discourse on what are the

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,750
activities that can be carried out I do

46
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,250
a little introduction on what

47
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:44,579
are

48
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,470
the scheme  of a social

49
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,799
engineer activity thanks tends to

50
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,659
start with the collection of information the

51
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,340
creation of trust with the user who

52
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,560
is attacked the former protection is

53
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,020
the exit the attack is over this is the

54
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,620
cycle of classic social engineering

55
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,360
being based  on the human

56
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,250
component to the hand component discourse and fundamental

57
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,770
open this discourse here otherwise

58
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,830
let's get out of what the film is based

59
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,780
on psychological principles that can

60
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,550
be guilt panic authority

61
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,830
sales desire was to tuire all the

62
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,690
other psychological leles to be able to

63
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,460
push a person to make a

64
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,870
donation or give us information

65
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,860
even the [ __ ] africa the drug

66
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,440
the  sick mom and all

67
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,300
there are 500,000 techniques that are

68
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,460
listed by the academic world of social

69
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,170
engineering from what social

70
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,240
engineering 1.0 we try in all the

71
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,980
manuals we find illegally on the

72
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,720
internet to what

73
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,210
advanced social engineering of the south surfing since

74
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,270
phishing that fishing then of course

75
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,220
we mean fishing but only the emails

76
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,010
also the phone calls and also the smi shing

77
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,980
of sms dumpster diving go and look for

78
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,570
a spacing of our competitors the

79
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,860
information we want from the customer

80
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,840
who brought us the activity

81
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,370
if you want to learn  to look for the

82
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,030
garbage doing tarsu and tia and

83
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,920
physical introduces cadio sum so

84
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,130
much of  fashion and we all like

85
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,390
the activity of which is carried out

86
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,989
mainly at company level that

87
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:22,090
asks another company to break

88
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,180
300 with similar ones are hyper 200 s

89
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,600
as anticipated and risk assessment which

90
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,940
came down to focus on only super

91
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,420
and 300 because it is more  interesting

92
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,800
the activity that can only be carried

93
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,810
out differently as you can see from

94
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,170
telephone personification to phishing

95
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,540
and all those you find here but this is not

96
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,810
the purpose of the talk the purpose is much more

97
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,769
boring and this I want to

98
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:53,739
simulate an attacker who tries to

99
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,110
steal information  to the manager to the

100
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,410
secretary to you who about my company

101
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,380
what can I do with the street I am done

102
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,580
talking to an enemy who carries out

103
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,560
activities around the world much more

104
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,450
than ours and I said to myself but

105
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,480
in Italy in the end

106
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,409
we talk about all social engineering

107
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:12,530
nice  yes but what is removed the two newspapers

108
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,750
buildings that are commissioned not

109
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,149
being phishing is just one of the many

110
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,760
activities that can be  eras carried out but

111
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,310
to what extent we can move

112
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,590
since the social component is

113
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,419
the human being and type is at the center of

114
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:26,990
these

115
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,540
activities unlike a software or

116
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,880
hardware on which I can pass

117
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,300
over rights that must be respected therefore

118
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,199
not everything  how illegal in 1970 the

119
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,570
legislator provided for the statute of

120
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,360
workers because it did so to prevent

121
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,960
companies from being able to spy on the big

122
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,880
brother number of employees without any

123
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,190
mercy without any limit

124
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,260
in this case there is article 4 of

125
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,430
1970 falls if we go to analyze  it is

126
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,960
important and it is interesting if

127
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,660
we get to the end it seems crap but

128
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,660
it is not avoided the use of audio

129
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,160
visual systems to other equipment for

130
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,840
remote control purposes

131
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,070
of the workers' activity us

132
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,349
when to be in the room and not just when

133
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:18,490
you do  the social engineering

134
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,160
activity what do you do a control activity not

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,349
on the software but on how the

136
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:27,530
human component of that company responds until

137
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,820
recently  ago from 1970 to 2015 it was not

138
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,830
really possible to

139
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,080
do social engineering as we imagine a

140
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,669
little hacker who is calling them

141
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:40,039
impersonates his mother, his aunt, his grandmother

142
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,139
and invents a thousand combos to get the

143
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:44,720
secretary up and write the malware

144
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,590
as she pleases  it could not be done but it has

145
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,729
changed

146
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:51,320
continue we still continue

147
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,639
with article 4 the control systems and

148
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,289
equipment that are

149
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,460
required by production organizational needs

150
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,849
or

151
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:01,820
work safety and then we are interested in the

152
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,940
juice which could be the employees

153
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,889
yes we can control them

154
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:08,810
yes  we can put cameras we

155
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,220
can verify everything

156
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,289
we want only with regard to the safety

157
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,229
of them so I cannot do

158
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:17,479
activities of any other kind that do not

159
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,000
fall into that case set out above

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,770


161
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,990
the new article 4 instead much

162
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,710
cooler for what the audiovisual systems allows

163
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,840
and  the other tools of

164
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,120
which to say also the possibility of

165
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,889
remote control  the activity of

166
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:34,720
workers can be used

167
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,669
exclusively for

168
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,949
productive organizational needs for

169
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:41,979
job safety and for the protection of

170
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:44,409
company assets can be

171
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:48,009
starred after agreements for us who

172
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:50,860
work in the world of TV what can

173
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,060
be considered as

174
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,069


175
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:56,889
company assets information  therefore,

176
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,919
activities of this type can be applied by

177
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,639
focusing on what the new

178
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,919
article 4 to the case in point is envisaged in

179
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:04,810
this part of the first paragraph for

180
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,580
organizational and production needs

181
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,500
for work safety and for the protection

182
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,099
of company assets

183
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:13,389
but this is a revolution  some have

184
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,009
passed silent but has brought

185
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,560
not just effects that can be

186
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,240
carried out control activities dinners without being

187
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,569
able to control even through third parties

188
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:25,360
your employee and therefore not only

189
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,250
the camera that enters

190
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,539
there is another way that sees when slow

191
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:30,280
when you go out but also

192
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,340
more specific control activities  and in order to

193
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,009
protect company assets, therefore,

194
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:38,800
in the sites a novelty before you could not

195
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,990
spy and check how

196
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,830
your employees will respond except

197
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,880
for safety reasons

198
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,099
now you want to check employees because

199
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,529
but they pass them in the tides

200
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:54,699
extremely sensitive information you can do it

201
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:55,539
because  part of the assets of the

202
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:57,969
company breast and employee an

203
00:07:57,969 --> 00:07:59,440
idiot who reveals information that he

204
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,550
must not disclose I must have the

205
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,770
possibility of being able to verify how

206
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,169
I can do it I can do it through social

207
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:10,389
engineering and not only the

208
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,729
above provision you have seen does not apply

209
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:14,169
to tools already  used by the

210
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:16,389
worker to make the performance

211
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:17,289
of the mere other tools

212
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,300
registration of

213
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,680
attendance access this which

214
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,289
simply indicates that those first leave the

215
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:24,759
discourse of what can already be

216
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,800
installed to check the attendance

217
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,389
of the worker

218
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:33,110
now comes the fun part

219
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,190
start I can check the employees

220
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,360
cool  ssimo I can do tests to

221
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,130
check how many aware of what

222
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,000
he has in his hands

223
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,630
but there is a but let's see if I found it is the

224
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,730
one in bold provided that it

225
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,390
adapts to the worker adequate

226
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,170
information on how to use and

227
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,660
the tools the three  tools and

228
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,720
carrying out the checks

229
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
I have read it wrong but you should have understood

230
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,260
what your dear employee says

231
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,540
you want to test that he is a manager

232
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,630
who if the secretary of fair reception

233
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,420
makes you laugh adequate information on

234
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,940
how to use and the tools and

235
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,230
carrying out the checks

236
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,870
this  what does it mean we do home that

237
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,459
we want to be active a

238
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:33,170
social engineering activity is contracted you want to

239
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,220
do a telephone impersonation it

240
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,070
will go so hi i am penetration test and i

241
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,480
'm calling you for that i'm doing

242
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,310
an activity that

243
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,350
your employer has commissioned which he believes is

244
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,860
an idiot

245
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,050
the demo to warn that he achieves this

246
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,120
square control activity that part

247
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,010
of his father is mo  rendo should

248
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,459
come to the hospital

249
00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:00,529
for sure it will work mine in

250
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:02,630
that very end

251
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,630
but the question is later despite the limitations

252
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:12,980
and all my [ __ ] employee that

253
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,870
I have tested through the activity is

254
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,199
verified that objectively he does not have the

255
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:21,290
skills and is a goat I can

256
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,380
fire him  16 thought it is not just one

257
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,180
in four fouls sure for me there is a

258
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,029
case that during a pit in the social

259
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,100
engineers who are not small classics are

260
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,980
absolute infrastructures it is verified

261
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,630
that the employee hicks is not competent

262
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,610
from this point of view here that all

263
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,230
checks that are made of physical

264
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,580
security

265
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,820
phishing of online presentation

266
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,420
falls totally an inept you can

267
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,820
fire him more or less the answer on

268
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,440
vacation no I go has brought us forward there is

269
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,520
a small sentence of the cassation

270
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,290
in the sentences of the cassation they do

271
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,880
jurisprudence as you know  that

272
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,910
create a precedent

273
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,890
this makes you laugh and

274
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,990
think about it with me there is a guy who is a company that wanted to

275
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,910
verify the production  activity of one of his

276
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,340
employees as he thought of doing it

277
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,950
being more productive he too

278
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,050
always making a facebook thread looking with the

279
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,120
employee to see if

280
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,330
during working hours he walked away

281
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,870
from the car where he worked he

282
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,000
discovered that he went away if he does not

283
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,380
treat the machine  creating a problem

284
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,300
for the company in this case square

285
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,130
worker so there was no theft of

286
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,440
information and they were not

287
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,570
significantly lost there was a slowdown in

288
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,590
work and therefore a loss of

289
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,450
assets but it is not in this case

290
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,930
that we are interested in it however it creates the

291
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,490
sentence creates a very

292
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,180
interesting precedent all

293
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,040
love appeals from the court appeal the

294
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,290
cassation arrives the cassation says these

295
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,520
points of state shared on the

296
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,040
cassation with the sentence

297
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,770
in the opinion of the supreme judges are

298
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,900
tendentially amis the

299
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,820
hidden defensive checks those that are

300
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,650
made of one per

301
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,140
standard social engineering activities also by

302
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,700
staff

303
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,600
here comes the  Bello is unrelated and

304
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,160
for the first time that

305
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,720
activities of this kind are allowed here

306
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,750
everything we have heard before that is

307
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,360
Italy 90 is not per cent [ __ ] you

308
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,830
could not do anything actively to the

309
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,690
organization extraneous

310
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,660
to the company organization and how many

311
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,840
directed to the ascertainment of

312
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,130
unlawful behavior other than

313
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,990
heroin fulfillment of work performance

314
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,630


315
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,860
if all the quantitative and

316
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,250
qualitative thread provided that the methods of

317
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,290
assessment are not excessively

318
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,059
invasive

319
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:57,639
no you cannot call saying that

320
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,519
their mother is dead you can do it and they are

321
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,919
respectful of the guarantees of freedom

322
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,169
and of  employee rights beyond all

323
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:06,809
the privacy discourse

324
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:09,999
what does this mean

325
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:11,859
he was right firing the employee and

326
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,989
the cassation given reason because he

327
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:15,039
did it

328
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,719
is a sentence as you can see from 2015

329
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:19,089
so I can modify he did it

330
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,819
because he did it to ascertain through  a

331
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:23,379
control system always against

332
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:26,049
we are talking covert if the employee

333
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:29,039
close but what I have to do

334
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:33,609
cameron the partner over if you have

335
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:48,309
questions or a me but it is not occult that is

336
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:54,749
the boss who chats with the will depend on ok

337
00:13:54,749 --> 00:14:04,739
yes it is the plot search

338
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,240
ok then a clarification I do not know if I

339
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,040
am wrong

340
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,230
when you said that it is more  close

341
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,379
yes the clarification when he said that

342
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:19,600
the employee should be notified

343
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,309
before being to take a test

344
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:26,170
usually companies tend to get you to

345
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,779
sign when they hire you they can

346
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:30,339
do it at any time so they

347
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:33,790
are no longer required to notify you about the speech

348
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,999
and you can  apart from the fact that it

349
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:38,620
always depends on you when it was hired pre or

350
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,529
post it has nothing to do with how many data

351
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,300
camero contract even if it does not want to, however

352
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,379
in the sense of reality it should be updated

353
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,290
because if I have not signed in the sense you

354
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,730
do not have to notify me of the possibility of doing

355
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,139
a check  of this type otherwise

356
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,800
you cannot do

357
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,430
it high-level trade union agreements are made

358
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,899
this happens in the reality that you

359
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,569
are nothing from the company you accept

360
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,519
secretly rope with the union and you

361
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,999
find the part of the agreements with the

362
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:08,559
union freely skipped for now

363
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,809
new york but tends to be either

364
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,730
an agreement is made with the union or that

365
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,980
of pt or with the minister of labor

366
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:26,379
beyond social engineering this

367
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:29,379
opens  also the doors to all those to the

368
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:32,470
issues of ssl inspection in fact because

369
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,910
it is in any case the protection of

370
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,980
the corporate information assets so

371
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,800
I can also go and check the

372
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,930
internet traffic for example makes

373
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,240
users on this issue there is

374
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,209
evidence at a legal level or  we have

375
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,220
focused on social engineering no but

376
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,230
we are not even focused on which

377
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,639
I will explain it to you in Italy there is no

378
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,889
culture of this type there are many

379
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:01,120
companies that sell tests you feel that there

380
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,740
are many companies that sell tests of this

381
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,350
kind but  everything is very unstable there

382
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,200
is no jurisprudence on the matter

383
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,430
the only sentence there are for

384
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,960
similar activities but it was not the activity

385
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,470
aimed at  what is

386
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,120
currently being created is a framework of what they are

387
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,970
doing at a European visual level is

388
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,770
called customs should take three

389
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,630
years should create a framework that is

390
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,790
based on both ethical and legal discourse

391
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,680
on what can be done at the

392
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,690
social engineering level so I assume that  from

393
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,460
here to a certain number of years we will come to

394
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,370
have a

395
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,980
scientific and honest ethical test setting in quotation marks

396
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,560
for activities of this type but we have not

397
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:48,520
yet reached that point not as

398
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,220
a social engineering control and therefore

399
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,090
one shot every now and then but the systems  as z

400
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,670
scale, the other things that instead use

401
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:02,620
continuous IT techniques and

402
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,780
essentially do the same type

403
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,089
of checks

404
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,119
in your opinion are covered by this type

405
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,779
of change in the statute of

406
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:14,409
workers

407
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,779
but as specified later

408
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:18,039
in the article that you had seen before

409
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:23,109
in the sentence we go back  behind there

410
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,799
are limits that are placed

411
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,419
guarantees of freedom and dignity

412
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:30,490
do what you want but compared to qu  these

413
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,039
two principles plus all

414
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,799
data protection based on what is

415
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,600
the privacy code this is what it means

416
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,880
that based on the type of control

417
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,789
each time it is up to the judge to weigh

418
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:45,370
how much the freedom of the

419
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,130
person and dignity are respected

420
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,380
but how many employees who connect

421
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,159
to the bank via the

422
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:56,260
company computer to buy

423
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,470
a train ticket know that there is a man in

424
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,240
the middle made by the company and that

425
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,159
the company could take

426
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:06,940
the bank password and all  but I don't think

427
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,850
many but one thing I have noticed I have been working

428
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,350
in the environment for two years we are

429
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,919
novices so I do not have experience

430
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,169
so many case studies few is that

431
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:20,080
this whole world here and it is in a

432
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,630
fine line between legal and illegal  it

433
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,169
never comes in the sense not going to

434
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:28,419
hit the human component

435
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:30,010
tendentially it could happen that

436
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,840
a thing was reported by a judge

437
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,570
a violation of the freedom of

438
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,669
dignity and no longer being allowed  or

439
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:38,350
as a control activity it is instead

440
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,390
another no I consider it much more serious

441
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:44,279
that the employee has been fired

442
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:47,260
because the employer has created a

443
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,230
fake profile for spies to understand if

444
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,539
this was ascertained during

445
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,159
the working hour minus I consider it  not

446
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:57,730
honest towards the person is an individual

447
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,250
you are at home mocking me

448
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,590
to understand if you are productive or not it

449
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,020
is a lot I do not find it limiting the

450
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,899
freedom but being a fresh stuff it is

451
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:09,610
here I think it will take time before

452
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,159
so many sentences are created and

453
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:13,899
many parallel regulations are made and the one that

454
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:16,210
the current legislation before having a

455
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,820
complete picture or at least a

456
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,600
basic framework

457
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:25,470
maybe I am reading it wrong but in

458
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,419
what this sentence from what

459
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,850
I read it says that

460
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,820
defensive checks are tendentially admissible

461
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,470
as  directed by certain to

462
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,299
ascertain unlawful behaviors

463
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,429
other than merely in fulfillment of the

464
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:39,929
performance so this was what he was

465
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,340
doing  cia this is not that he was

466
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,720
absent from work to chat

467
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,970
the water he is assisting from work to

468
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,409
ascertain but that is in fulfillment

469
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:48,929
of the work performance the speech

470
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:51,200
and speeches of the sentence here comes out of the

471
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,370
nova type totally declined with

472
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,870
speeches he did the part first

473
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,730
the important thing was simple was the part

474
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,250
that the cassation provided for the

475
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,840
possibility of making defensive checks

476
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,389
or points it can be a

477
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:04,980
cult defensive check also verify that you

478
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,470
god that the hicks person knows how to

479
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,960
manage passwords or know how to

480
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,940
manage the data that is there  were given

481
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,240
no the boy in question simply

482
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,350
on the ninth suspect that she is not the most

483
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,460
productive they created a profile

484
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,019
flaws of a woman there is a message

485
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,549
in the evening then during work hours

486
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:22,230
she sent him a message at 11

487
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,299
something this here has  took the

488
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:25,620
bathroom break together gets

489
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,990
wet texted with with girl created

490
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,870
employer employer face

491
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,559
dismissal  for just cause

492
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,779
there has been an appeal for no for

493
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,880
dismissal around now with the new

494
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,100
legislation all nine are you can

495
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,480
be fired without too many problems

496
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,519
but it was the fact that it was dismissal

497
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,220
for just cause that it was

498
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,460
to be able to frame the employee

499
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,480
for a minor offense year ago they

500
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,710
reached the cassation

501
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,120
for this reason they did not know if they had

502
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,090
committed a crime or not with the

503
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,679
new reform they do not have how on the crime

504
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,380
you can start a criminal case for

505
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,830
that but in the meantime the job has lost it

506
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:22,350
it doesn't make you laugh so poor but if you

507
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,780
create a false profile of a person who

508
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,370
left a crime but create more

509
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,140
selloff a profile face a person who

510
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,940
does not exist than a girl is still

511
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,840
given but if the person is not necessarily

512
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,400
on facebook and  to force the

513
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,929
name and surname true sine die fan

514
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,129
oh well then put a nickname

515
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:48,389
but you can not register with a false name and

516
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:51,659
surname no anyway if you are

517
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,240
interested in the subject and  I and

518
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,389
three other technical guys and less technicians and

519
00:21:57,389 --> 00:22:00,480
lawyers thought we would continue all

520
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,190
this study here so we will keep you

521
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,659
informed because they thought they were going to go

522
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,539
ahead and try to give a mini thrill

523
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,340
of what it is possible to do as an

524
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,269
activity is what it is not possible to

525
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:11,340
do tendentially  I hope the

526
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,350
message has arrived if not to

527
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,090
