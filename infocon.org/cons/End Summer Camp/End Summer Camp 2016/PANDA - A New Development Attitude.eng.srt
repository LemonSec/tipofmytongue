1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
being the capture the flag I meant

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,779
that raw food newspapers uber alles di

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:12,269
shift su caro and that's it then let's start

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,990
with this talk then we talk to

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,800
a panda and new developer the attitude in

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,289
unix are in fashion the recurring names there is

7
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,269
so we used we could

8
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:28,230
obviously  to be outdone

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,769
we could not really be and yes we have

10
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,270
written many books on how to make

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,969
software as God commands and then

12
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,850
we too have given our contribution

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,590
starting from a project that we

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,840
found ourselves developing for one of our

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,559
clients and now we explain how

16
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:48,120
we approached  and what were

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,710
the winning solutions actually to

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,620
develop and manage this project

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,969
then the project an ecommerce of

20
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,609
v2 things tending to be piratical things never

21
00:00:59,609 --> 00:00:59,879
seen

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,250
exactly the customer came to us he

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,989
wanted to sell these things

24
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,339
clearly we involved

25
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,500
the marketing department the name had been

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,600
quite ha  chosen by the customer also

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,610
because it also says the customer's name and

28
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,979
the  tag line was extremely

29
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,770


30
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,020
funny we have it but rome to put it the marketing

31
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,880
loved it when he never put us wood

32
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,969
cul de sac jackie fucek

33
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:24,710
large crb kennel I also managed it among

34
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,320
other things and for the logo there is also a plate

35
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,710
after exactly this  client

36
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,090
we are about to take a picture of him obviously

37
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,060
so that during one of the meetings the

38
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,000
doll you see was him the pirate

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,479
avezzano exactly the client came

40
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,399
to us we start the project then the

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,479
client began as the

42
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,130
great expectations when he makes

43
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,090
his shops he wants to do it well and  a

44
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,429
friend immediately told him that it costs a [ __ ]

45
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:59,450
on the other hand the shops are cheap

46
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,630
exactly and so he part of

47
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,069
his huge expectations of spending he

48
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:05,720
wanted a few things he wanted a lot of

49
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,159
things he wanted things like a trolley

50
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,769
just like that is clearly

51
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:12,079
Obviously, however, the bad thing was

52
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:13,610
that he had his cousin who did it to him

53
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,319
the friend who told him it cost little

54
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,480
so whether or not it is obviously co  yes to little

55
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,970
commercial where we have little money we

56
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,829
think about the times no problem

57
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,269
we also make tight deadlines beyond

58
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:24,769
the initials syria and its

59
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,510
commercial stock and above all when he knows

60
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,670
the business he decides the times

61
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,620
exactly it is essential exactly

62
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,900
jackson horde with the customer you risk

63
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,440
moving forward

64
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,610
and then we take the team the

65
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,409
team of course heck you are having

66
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:45,349
a strike 2016 here in rome brand new

67
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:46,819
there are those of you who have never heard

68
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,290
of lechuck you can go say I

69
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,760
worked for the e-commerce of the chats and

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,190
then of course  the prestige is enough a

71
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,720
feedback on linkedin the

72
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,459
exact age that will have said that we

73
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,440
could have branded ourselves with this thing so

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,450
let's put it safely that

75
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,269
we can say that we have worked for him

76
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:04,069
but of course we use

77
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:05,720
enterprise solutions so if not in

78
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,959
summary a little the programmer we can

79
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,030
always  use of the software type

80
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,910
database 100 thousand euros exactly is the

81
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,260
more mature choice too  because in any case he

82
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,690
does more ater prize when after he goes to

83
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,150
talk to get us financed he did it

84
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,709
with the money exactly available

85
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:28,310
also muray as a referent if

86
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,049
someone did you could ask everything

87
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:31,280
quietly to marechiaro a

88
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,870
solid funny guy always as you have

89
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,549
seen so yes  could interact

90
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,310
easily and then let's start with

91
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,630
the analysis is correct then first of all

92
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,169
as you see few questions and fewer

93
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:47,150
answers in the sense that the customer in

94
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,709
most cases did not know what to

95
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,540
do was busy playing

96
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,220
and why ask him then exactly

97
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,010
so we must  so i can

98
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,419
give it a strong hand exactly

99
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,620
obviously as long as we do the analysis the

100
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,660
best thing is to listen to all the

101
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,980
possible nuances we speak italian

102
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,150
in english we

103
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,730
mix terms the same thing can

104
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,049
be defined in a hundred different ways

105
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,519
because there are a lot of

106
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,199
different nuances to  a product so let's

107
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,629
actually get confused we will

108
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,190
grasp it  very exact

109
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,329
exactly

110
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,548
and then since the institution did not give

111
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:21,709
many questions we go to the referent a

112
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,710
believer obviously is not the one who pays saga

113
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,050
obviously saw it precision

114
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,150
new region knew the business I

115
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,389
did not know the internal processes and therefore

116
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,830
ok then the situation began to

117
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,780
become practical  and then the more mature choice

118
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,530


119
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,840
we went to the literature we

120
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,610
saw that there are development methods

121
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,280
that are tested and have a lot of

122
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,360
years in which they are used it works

123
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,879
is the best way of they have used it

124
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,949
in many exact chahil analysis of the

125
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:54,680
requirements to the  development and testing and

126
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,199
the coup and therefore she becomes a lady after

127
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,270
all we actually said if a

128
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,139
guy in precarious textile development

129
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,639
as well as for development so

130
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,710
clearly it is not a problem of

131
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,330
course I recommend meetings the

132
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,529
meetings I know you have to talk you

133
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:14,569
have to decide what to talk about for  the next

134
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:16,370
meeting also actually that is

135
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,710
we have seen before if not if it does not give you

136
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,240


137
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,160
no to the questions they don't give you answers

138
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,870
obviously the things you have to do you have to

139
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,430
stay down there you have to go back there you have to

140
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,949
talk to each other every time so if they

141
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:29,060
don't want to go to answers we have to

142
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,740
do it was against having answers

143
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,930
on everything to decide everything even before

144
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,940
starting in Rome  therefore meetings

145
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,160
meetings meetings and therefore practically

146
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,910
absolute that our programmers spoke again

147
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,080
because

148
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,430
we finally involved them one who is well-determined

149
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,310
in design unique programmer who

150
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,930
likes to do things differently

151
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,150
we know many languages that not many

152
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,960
libraries

153
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
we try to use them all then you

154
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,990
remember  there was the good one pincher to the

155
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,849
one good in one language was the one

156
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:57,110
good in another language who

157
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,490
knew best to you free to make them

158
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,560
work happy exact we greet the

159
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,569
potential causes exactly so we

160
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:04,099
mix there we also mix because

161
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:05,449
in short, come on it's nice you study a lot

162
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,970
of  more new things then came the

163
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,310
boom  chuck to which we subjected

164
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,139
to our analysis he promises a

165
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,690
genius and said what he thought and

166
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,240
customer and then yes obviously yes

167
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,800
you see commercial that kelly says

168
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,009
absolutely yes you can do exactly

169
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:23,479
it's ok

170
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,070
beyond the jokes let's see

171
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,099
some things  useful that there are patterns

172
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:30,110
that were useful to us the first one

173
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,699
we applied that there is a lot in

174
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,740
literature design by committee that is

175
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,360
actually you do a project for

176
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,800
a company a company is made up of

177
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,719
many people there is not only chiti

178
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:40,490
commission those who need that

179
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,570
functionality

180
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,919
everyone has the right to have their say because it

181
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,330
is represented in the company

182
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,380
we know that we asked the

183
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,599
delivery man if he liked the color is a

184
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:47,960
bomb,

185
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,610
that is, alongside very useful advice even

186
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,590
just pink for exact cause so

187
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,300
listen to the  everyone's opinion because it is

188
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,699
important who users of the people but there

189
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,770
are two against 20 if the company is

190
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,210
large 2 against a hundred

191
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,759
we listen to everyone that it is a good id

192
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,520
and what

193
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,550
are you doing the meetings meetings

194
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,250
on the slide above obviously

195
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,740
a lot of ideas come out there isn't there

196
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,509
we don't try to follow one

197
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:15,520
we try all of them we try to put them

198
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,520
all on the plate and not find one

199
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,930
practically stimulates them we look at them everything

200
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,819
is  beautiful you style has like the cat

201
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:22,750
when the car comes in front of

202
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,199
you look at all these solutions and you

203
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,479
will see how positive it is, in short, like when you go

204
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,009
it was a week of time with

205
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,349
friends to eat pizza and each one

206
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:34,000
proposes a different place exactly

207
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,400
exactly and then it ends  that

208
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,400
a house is wrong ok if the development article

209
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,539
we have taken a group photo of the

210
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:42,389
team and in fact of the act

211
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:47,199
here it is well then analysis we have

212
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,030
made it to the sector obviously

213
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,889
water for us the requirements produces a

214
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,039
lot of documentation and the customer

215
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,319
has more  sense to hear it later after

216
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,810
exactly here we see the rules you do not

217
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,800
go to talk to the inter but then he

218
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,509
phoned let her oven took the

219
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,490
phone  born is sure to hear that he had not

220
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,229
yet paid and not yet paid

221
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:10,870
that is, two days before the deadline he

222
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,639
began to have his say but then

223
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,960
I eto'o had internal on a problem

224
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,430
sorry we were busy

225
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,590
developing we had already decided everything

226
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,180
no problem watch from tomorrow

227
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,469
sorry let's do it so you can

228
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:21,880
contact me at any time you can

229
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,440
write me on mozzato then write me on

230
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,180
facebook also call spot but

231
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,190
he also sends emails that is the idea is

232
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,819
either do not use any channel to talk

233
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:31,779
to customers or  satellite

234
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,159
without distinction without any problem

235
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,169
also because 2016 we have many

236
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,940
there we are in the exact 80s I was

237
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,919
expecting only carrier pigeon

238
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,860
we all made it and then lechuck arrived

239
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,419
who speaking told us that

240
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,930
on the internet in bed that there is already the is

241
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,510
already the e scrum cause good because

242
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,130
going to see works very well to

243
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,580
find customers like this

244
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,780
and then you can also put it on the

245
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,480
reference on lin  kedin so I did

246
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,000
a project and j with a contract and

247
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,300
therefore no sea he was very happy

248
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,360
you see it and giles cram that if you tried to

249
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,370
go to led there are many books but there is

250
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,000
already good a scrum page good or bad

251
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,210
in twenty pages summarizes the  they

252
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,570
explain things but then the customer

253
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,030
said them better than us we immediately

254
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,950
talked to the salesman because in this

255
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,170
case it was certainly necessary to see

256
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,030
commessaggio via never arrived yes yes with

257
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,720
the head and with nema problem and then

258
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,300
away with via cona giles deacon and zaia la

259
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,300
è  the customer has decided that then it is from

260
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,570
him there will be three plus three scan

261
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,010
masters from him but obviously

262
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,140
in fact that you actually scrum

263
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,120
will be the one and twenty pages that I said a

264
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,190
moment ago but in fact on guidelines yes

265
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,290
no rules here not  rules so it's okay

266
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,640
that is you keep in mind but then he will

267
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,070
interpret see play it in short

268
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,410
also clear because he already has the clear

269
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,700
so already the change changes and agile the

270
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,920
customer as usual has reason  and then

271
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,350
practically that is we are talking about these

272
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,120
express lumina what is a sprint that is

273
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,760
from a to that is you can change your mind during

274
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,340
that is if you get an idea to play I

275
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,810
can not wait for the end after link to

276
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,580
see this new functionality fundamental for me

277
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,110
there is  a better idea and

278
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,090
immediately implement it absolutely

279
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,650
absolutely worked if it

280
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,800
was positive and then okay we

281
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,960
obviously have time exhausted yes also because

282
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,350
then we always start giving neighbors

283
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,140
waste time making perspectives

284
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,780
so much in the end everyone worked everyone

285
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,010
knew his language that  sense had a

286
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,580
retrospective alpha and reason together

287
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,400
and then we have the team leader and p or the

288
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,050
enlightened clients and the clear

289
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,150
separation and responsibilities is

290
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,040
fundamental because client was an

291
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,230
expert yueye knew how to program

292
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,360
for his friend he explained to him how

293
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,960
things are done

294
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,380
then oh well it's a shock and therefore

295
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,120
practically nothing him and he could do

296
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,880
everything and do not want is so they

297
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,010
found us that esat  we see them

298
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,780
the responsibilities only ideas we have

299
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,310
a scooter and an oracle

300
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,120
sorry the responsibility we do not arrive

301
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,980
on the team which is a fundamental part

302
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,810
for the development that is more or less

303
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,500
what the work does

304
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,000
this is a bit like approaching we

305
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,830
approached the construction of the

306
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,690
team beyond the experts in each in

307
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,940
their respective and skills we have seen

308
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,430
that the modular software and because the

309
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,170
team cannot be modular

310
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,000
therefore it is actually possible to

311
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,710
keep them separate working for

312
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,160
silos each in its own not going to

313
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,150
mix also because then

314
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,280
actually in fact  they are paid to

315
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,900
hit the keys then between a question and

316
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,700
questions yes but to those who answer them in

317
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,990
a manner of time did not answer you

318
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,180
answer wine obviously do them and

319
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,300
therefore we are actually

320
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,470
also found with someone good

321
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,360
because in any case sometimes inside every

322
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,360
dev there is a  genius so every now and then

323
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,370
one came to mind we do

324
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,160
something new add  mo things but we do not

325
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,320
discuss lenn we do not document so much I

326
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,760
am a genius so the others will

327
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,560
take it for good exact and therefore we

328
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,730
have encouraged the fact that

329
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,980
someone could express his

330
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,170
genius exactly without

331
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,160
questioning because then the discussion

332
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,110
now meanwhile we are competent

333
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,570
mentalized sectors everyone works  in his then

334
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,730
you go to from there to another look I am

335
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,560
doing a feature it triggers a

336
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,690
discussion that maybe afterwards also goes

337
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,070
to question other parts of the

338
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,780
project improvements no now you have

339
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,000
done it let's finish it as I was and

340
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,800
let's hope the review those exactly and

341
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,390
document those of you who have ever

342
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,750
documented something or even better those who

343
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,840
have never read the documents but for example

344
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,910
and then we might as well not do them also

345
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,650
because they change by definition so at the

346
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,090
point I'm not even time to write them they

347
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,800
have already changed so then if we

348
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,230
talk about them a lot remains  also imprinted

349
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,330
so you don't actually need to go to

350
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,470
there we know

351
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,290
it is said that less documentation more

352
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,240
other things here exact localized

353
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,300
job and especially when working

354
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,460
in watertight compartments if you see a

355
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,140
problem it is not your

356
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,880
problem or if you have obviously solve it

357
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,950
independently of someone else and if

358
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,900
someone else will not tell you

359
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,400
probably the  you are already working

360
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:19,640
I don't know exactly always cystic life

361
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,720
you can go and half a day

362
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,910
and then with arcs behind even his fault

363
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,139
exactly

364
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,699
you always have to point the finger at whoever is

365
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:29,430
wrong and so one is self-

366
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,290
responsible exactly then

367
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,089
something happened someone someone

368
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:34,829
actually a little  has moved away

369
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:35,490
from the earthquake

370
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,220
yes but I think that the turnover is

371
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,560
positive positive because in any case many

372
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,990
people and they know each other talk to each other and like

373
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,949
the speech and they speak

374
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,959
no no no no they have spoken we must not

375
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,939
talk to each other ok so actually to

376
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:52,439
beautiful every now and then you put  someone

377
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:53,610
maybe someone who has never even

378
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,050
seen the project actually can

379
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,480
give you a diversity of views  ute clear

380
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,339
then it can interpret a little in short,

381
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,769
revisit the codes and see etcetera

382
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,019
that this one comments itself

383
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:11,100
objectively also this in fact

384
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,170
that has a certain point when it is developed and

385
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,350
many people always think about these

386
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,170
new these new methodologies ukipt

387
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,160
svn sometimes you have to think  even at the

388
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,930
fly because maybe after you have to put it

389
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,490
online show the exact customer and

390
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,790
then we clashed it

391
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,160
was that we often hear you

392
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,809
how we have it how we solved it this

393
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,389
is a bit of our expression in fact

394
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:39,899
then a cool one a flowers a cool

395
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,120
that is, no the most mature choice

396
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,649
initially was dropbox

397
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,439
because then you can pass the code

398
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:49,079
obviously the pass the code then you

399
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,209
went up again when you can simplify the

400
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:53,779
house if it is like a folder but it is

401
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,620
shared on everyone

402
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,839
exactly there are also the photos and then c  'is

403
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,370
that client for the exact cell phone

404
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,019
so maybe as long as you upload the photos

405
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,069
you can see what he did during the

406
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,879
barbecue things de  The genre worked

407
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,170
then it also keeps you the revisions that

408
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,629
is not the best

409
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:11,160
the only thing we tried to use

410
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,480
of you but there is the fourth that

411
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,579
kit stitch folder that was given yesterday it worked

412
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,189
light on the project and it has a lot of

413
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:19,470
space occupies the space and therefore we

414
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,800
have as a brains apparatus no no no

415
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,780
no ok

416
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,190
we had to load the application a bit

417
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,200
yes we asked our

418
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,710


419
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,720
very senior senior consultants in fact fit and ftp

420
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,890
works boy a 30 years old we use

421
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,810
effects full yes it's never  broken had to

422
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,710
be the same one that suggested us

423
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:47,010
waterfall however no ftp was the

424
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,750
more mature choice anyway to manage

425
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,710
the deployment bar any exactly

426
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,300
also because in any case then it is

427
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,090
actually if you get your

428
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:57,450
hands on it

429
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,880
exactly put that you have a hotfix go via

430
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,250
ssh is a  novelty

431
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,210
and so it is so obviously I give you a

432
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,830
tip do not mix you remember

433
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,240
when we mixed we tried

434
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,460
to regret directly with seul with

435
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,700
with kitsis modify the cod  ice then

436
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,410
not to use no no we tried to

437
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,320
regret with kit a ok fast a protein

438
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,220
year and with kit it was difficult because

439
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,560
then when he asked to eat

440
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,890
things ok ok ok comit push pull and he has already

441
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,110
filled all the files of major

442
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,030
major  greater than the di rob strangers

443
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:40,190
and avoids doing everything is in fact so

444
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,300
thanks to the machines we also

445
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,320
save it we have saved a

446
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,410
little bit a single physical machine so

447
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,320
quietly a single you are a bus

448
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,940
you can look at the photos check

449
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,770
the code changes and also the machine

450
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,380
and log in  to only one and it is all in one

451
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,210
obviously that the very

452
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,230
comfortable one and the pattern we have the

453
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,760
patterns we have seen during

454
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,490
development are two are fundamental the

455
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,950
first is 20 in the wheel there is in the sense

456
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,220
when you do an ecommerce and it is

457
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,859
61  innovator in a certain way both in 2016

458
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:15,319
they haven't seen any yet so you have to

459
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,630
invent things it's okay to invent them

460
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,179
that is, don't look for other people's solutions that

461
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:21,859
you won't find  exactly or better be

462
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:25,099
careful if they are solutions

463
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,929
of others actually they did not

464
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:28,940
understand what we needed so

465
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,820
it is actually better if you improve

466
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,950
something and if in the best you

467
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,049
also put some bug of your type because

468
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:39,140
it is actually more fun so one

469
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,270
who takes it  he uses it and sees

470
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,190
our give on a very strong exactly

471
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,400
then improve improve improve

472
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,500
and we finally arrive at the aler line and

473
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,650
then it was a bad quarter of an hour a bit you

474
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,890
had to put the exact things on the servers

475
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,480
the salesman obviously had

476
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,820
decided so little to do  do

477
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,080
obviously we are already the microphone

478
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,840
here we are exact we are already there so

479
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,260
obviously we went a little tight and

480
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,059
then the best thing we increase the

481
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:11,690
workforce

482
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,490
exactly we saw that they are

483
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,510
beautiful sites I say mechanical turk

484
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,270
calm people from other continents

485
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,179
doing things  because making software and

486
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:25,460
making pizza is not so much different only

487
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,530
that pizza from india anymore  long to

488
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,799
deliberate exact therefore and it costs less

489
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,780
that I know what you can do right so

490
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,390
we absolutely hired a

491
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,610
few people we hired a few people

492
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,289
even absolutely junior on the project

493
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,120
because obviously she could also give us a chance

494
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,559
to see how a

495
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,409
good done the young people exactly and therefore

496
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:47,480
also here solutions can be

497
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,710
like patten de march so obviously

498
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,210
guys the deadline songlines little to

499
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,760
do obviously if we have underestimated

500
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,530
it is not a problem ditto they do not have to ask

501
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,360
questions and I can also sleep with the

502
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,950
wheel operates absolutely  those known

503
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,890
as weeks the vein is not a problem

504
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,070
that we have had from life it is however

505
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,990
well the project is finished

506
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,660
and today practically every now and then the

507
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,210
customer may have paid so it is already a

508
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,880
good thing exactly stopped

509
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,740
being our problem it paid

510
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,900
when we saw  the transfer is enough

511
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,309
via solved

512
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:24,020
we are all very happy every now and then it

513
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,210
happens that you call him or mother but

514
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,550
or  Obviously you call it dispensed

515
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:33,170
present I don't feel you mine I hear you I

516
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,600
call it we ignore it

517
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,390
ok it's some of the decided to go

518
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,830
we understood why because since it

519
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,210
was a great environment the work was

520
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,059
silent there were no meetings

521
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,250
they put the references on linkedin

522
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,710
on  facebook on pinterest that by now has

523
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,510
made the references is gone we

524
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,290
avoided those animani and if

525
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,240
something goes well that you pay we will find not

526
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,640
us by definition we do not talk to the

527
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,320
people who worked on the project that

528
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,120
is not correct it is not against because

529
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,600
he has it now enough is the money enlargers

530
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,000
so we decided to ignore

531
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,690
improve them no longer needed it went

532
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,940
well

533
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,289
questions ok then jokes barthel to us

534
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,100
we made a presentation

535
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,409
absolutely then I meant semi-

536
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:28,299
serious but absolutely not serious

537
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:30,970
I think everyone a little obviously  I hope

538
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,350
not with all these dynamics but

539
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,779
experiences of this type there have

540
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:36,639
been some we have passed too and we have

541
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:39,460
them  I love everyone and if you look online

542
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,110
you will find a lot of documentation

543
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,610
on what are the anti patterns

544
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,830
generally at the code level but they are

545
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,320
very useful in my opinion you know that we

546
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,700
are then developed re or commercial or

547
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,429
produced in seeing how many times

548
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:56,769
we risk running into  dynamics that

549
00:20:56,769 --> 00:21:00,399
are actually carriers of

550
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:02,460
mismanagement

551
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,750
so if you see one of these,

552
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,220
worry

553
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,379
exactly ok enough
