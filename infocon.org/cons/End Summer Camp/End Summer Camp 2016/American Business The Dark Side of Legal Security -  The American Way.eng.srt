American Way so there's a lot of

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,219
companies out there in information

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,000
security that do things legal illegal

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,980
that the illegal ones don't have to be

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,900
necessarily ethical they could be very

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,090
bad so we'll go through a little bit

Francisco a CCC camp Bay threat and of

35
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,140
course escape yeah um let's start off by

36
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,229
co Americans a great vitali women are

37
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,860
better this is true statement very true

38
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,590
and thank you all so we'll start with

39
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,479
the hacking culture just general in the

40
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,140
United States so um it used to be very

41
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,200
communal I'm Jeff Moss right here the

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,509
founder and creator of Def Con it used

43
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,098
to just be the first step con you should

44
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,989
be a hundred friends similar to how this

45
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,060
one is here probably really really close

46
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,470
people hanging out

47
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,270
talking sharing security ideas and

48
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,250
having a huge level of community later

49
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,410
things got bigger and bigger the next

50
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,690
event was 200 people then 400 and just

51
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,180
it kept growing from there excuse me

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,250
there's about twenty two thousand

53
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,660
attendees at Def Con now and it's it's a

54
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,100
huge party but it's not as it used to be

55
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,380
it's not as communal it's not as close

56
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,960
to the culture as escape is Oreskes

57
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,180
sorry I'm on the right is Bruce Schneier

58
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,310
he's the he wrote the modern

59
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,430
cryptography and is a very big

60
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,100
contributor to defcon as well just just

61
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,420
in the fact that you know he attends

62
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,010
gives talks and everything else similar

63
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,590
to how many of you do as well so thank

64
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,440
you for giving back all right and then

65
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,120
there's also other types of people that

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,390
are in said community so we have

67
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,220
multiple actually every one of these

68
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,970
that people have been arrested we have a

69
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,140
political activist and then we also have

70
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,010
people that just want to learn other

71
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,200
scientists who just do it to push how

72
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,260
far they can you know do things we have

73
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,790
kevin Mitnick on the left side who is

74
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,239
actor in the 90s who got wrapped up in

75
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,540
the whole like oh you'd pack yes we know

76
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,220
that's completely illegal just just go

77
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,560
to jail right now to Snowden on the

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,730
right side who's very politically

79
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,800
motivated and wanted to share what the

80
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,810
NSA was doing with not only the American

81
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,930
people but every person in the US um

82
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,430
yeah so all right so def con um cost two

83
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,560
hundred and forty dollars it lasts for

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,080
days it's in Las Vegas 22,000 so that's

85
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,850
about five point two eight million

86
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:57,090
dollars to deal with now um the a lot of

87
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,100
these talks deal with like exploiting

88
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,400
different vulnerabilities even big brand

89
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,940
name companies such as Cisco Apple this

90
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,140
and that so they have actually

91
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,049
subpoenaed the founder of the host or

92
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,660
Jeff mossing you need to provide every

93
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,970
single customer information every single

94
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,100
attendee because they're doing illegal

95
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,019
things they're talking about illegal

96
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,200
things and we want to know who goes to

97
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,750
these events so Jeff Moss he said no

98
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,400
 that no we're not going to do that

99
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,210
we

100
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,990
only do cash so he doesn't have any

101
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,280
records of any of these people so that's

102
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,650
one little legality loop that you know

103
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,930
that you know the founder is at the debt

104
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,940
levels on your side there's a lot of

105
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,560
feds that attend but that's beside the

106
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,160
point it's held in Las Vegas conference

107
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,639
I villages user friendly area there's

108
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,889
over two inches tots lots of alcohol

109
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,220
it's not free so one of the big

110
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,580
differences between this conference and

111
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,789
a few other ones is that this especially

112
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:02,039
in the US this is one of the most

113
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,740
communal ones and as you can see there's

114
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,060
a lot of people so you have to worry

115
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,110
about a lot of different types of

116
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,599
elements and things that the smaller

117
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:10,620
ones you don't really have to worry

118
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,990
about so it becomes less personable so

119
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,210
this is why I love asked like it's it's

120
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,120
exactly where I would rather be so so

121
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,570
this is def con and the next one is the

122
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,210
RSA Conference seven hundred to one

123
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,340
thousand seven hundred dollars six days

124
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,599
it's also in Las Vegas um no it's not

125
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:34,289
it's also in San Francisco and then most

126
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,690
of this is recruiting you start up a bit

127
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,150
security company you get a little cozy

128
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,220
but that costs like ten twenty thousand

129
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,190
dollars and then you you go to some

130
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,380
parties and you throw parties your

131
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,570
company throws these parties and then

132
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,880
you have other engineers researchers

133
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,130
come in you buy them drinks and stuff

134
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,719
like that but it's really just saying

135
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:57,150
like yo you see my dick here right like

136
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,360
yeah like we're doing well like come

137
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,240
join us kind of thing um and a lot of

138
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,380
these a lot of the people here are

139
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,419
making really really good money they're

140
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,289
making at least like 75,000 to 150 200

141
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:13,590
thousand dollars a year so these people

142
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,949
are very very well off and it's all

143
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:18,870
networking so you go shake hands with

144
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,060
not only the people that are technical

145
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,400
but then the douchebags that

146
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,949
sell the technology that are just like

147
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,110
oh yeah yeah yeah you do this yeah we

148

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,150

153
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,160

154
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,870
one ticket at last two days um and this

155
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,550

156
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,580
where you just go and say oh I I do this

00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,210
Jeff Moss the founder of Def Con second

167
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,730
to the second person on the very right

168
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,300
side so that person in the orange or tan

169
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,540
color that's a Bruce Schneier again

170
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,280
giving another a keynote talk I believe

171
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,410
so these people are opening up the

172
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,300
speaker so these are high-level CISOs

173
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,720
like Google see so it might be there

174
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,260
yahoo amazon these are like the the

175
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,700
biggest of the big people that would go

176
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,410
shake hands and if you want to start a

177
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,910
business you want to work for them like

178
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,580
directly you just talk to them they say

179
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,370
send us your resume and oh yeah you got

180
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,380
the job it's fine then you just start

181
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,630
making stupid amount money again my

182
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,070
dick's bigger than yours come to my

183
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,990
party I'll cash you out I'll do all this

184
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,150
stuff and we do this in security isn't

185
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,890
that a lot of people think like the

186
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,960
security companies might be fighting

187
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,630
each other but when it comes to this we

188
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,300
just party and drink and and then where

189
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,010
everyone inside is friends with each

190
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,020
other whether you have competition or

191
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,700
not you're still friends and hang out

192
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,270
and stuff so alright so one of the

193
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,790
biggest difference is that you can

194
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,010
figure out when speaking with somebody

195
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,050
especially American is what do they do

196
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,090
so if somebody says information security

197
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,280
they're most likely working in financial

198
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,370
or some other types of business that is

199
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,979
more private sector if they say cyber

200
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,020
security you can bet that they work for

201
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,360
a three-letter agency or something close

202
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,309
to it maybe their contractor of some

203
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:44,310
type so these little keywords will tell

204
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,290
you exactly what kind of work somebody

205
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,900
does so if they say cyber defense or

206
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,970
cyber security if you're doing something

207
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,350
you just just shut the up

208
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,670
alright so seventy six point nine

209
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,630
billion dollars is the total projected

210
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,050
information security spending 2015 and

211
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,060
um this is a lot of money

212
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,339
obviously so there's a lot of companies

213
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:12,069
that just start brand new startup that's

214
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:14,500
like you know if you have an idea you

215
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,380
just find a rich person to say to find

216
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,480
you and give you money so right now I

217
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,040
got a buddy who's looking for about 2

218
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,660
million dollars to start up his company

219
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,720
and right now for the large majority

220
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,970
it's him and maybe a few other people

221
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,100
two three four people right so your

222
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,839
salary is gonna be paid off very well

223
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,670
you're going to have all the

224
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,810
infrastructure you need and stuff like

225
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,920
that and you should be able to last a

226
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,470
little while so you can break up those

227
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,000
salaries and however you want / set

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,250
inches cup any equity there's many

229
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,199
different types of ways to do this but I

230
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:46,240
won't go into the huge business aspect

231
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,399
of it just saying that there is a lot of

232
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,230
money in security specifically in the

233
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,980
United States as well all right so

234
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,000
America is very sooo happy um the joke

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,160
this joke says a good lawyer knows the

236
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,190
law a great lawyer knows the judge no

237
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,690
saying that you know you'll just get

238
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,339
right on out because it's like oh we

239
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,260
went to college together we partied

240
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,339
together um you know it's all you'll get

241
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:15,069
off don't worry about it but right now

242
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:18,639
we're talking more about legal cases in

243
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,389
terms of information security so there's

244
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,370
financial exhaustion this so this

245
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,440
happens when two companies sue each

246
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,180
other google versus Facebook or whatever

247
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,990
the and they just know that the

248
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,269
lawsuit will happen so long that they'll

249
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:35,860
just try to break down their finances

250
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,930
usually it happens between David and

251
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,899
Goliath so you'll have google suing this

252
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:43,779
tiny company who just started they have

253
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,399
a patent on something and Google wants

254
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,649
it so they'll sue that and then those

255
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,720
sue them for like they projected Lee

256
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,550
will sue them for like five years and

257
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,649
then it's been a few million dollars and

258
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:55,769
then the little company doesn't have

259
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:58,449
enough money to keep sending the lawyers

260
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,069
and keep sending so they have to close

261
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,750
up and become bankrupt at which time

262
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,290
Google takes over there's also royalties

263
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,670
um

264
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,600
with so like carpal tunnel so let's say

265
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,790
you have a job in the United States

266
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,200
you've been working for you know 25 5 or

267
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,470
10 years and you're you're let's say

268
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,940
you're older and you're going to retire

269
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,740
in another five years if you're making

270
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,080
maybe a hundred thousand dollars and

271
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,880
your projected to work five more years

272
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,650
but you get carpal tunnel right and just

273
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,150
because the place where you're working

274
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,430
because you're on the computer you can

275
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,410
sue your copy you can sue that company

276
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,170
for the amount of time that you would

277
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,570
have normally worked up until and the

278
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,430
amount of salary you had so that's five

279
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,810
years for a hundred thousand dollars

280
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,640
that's half a billion dollars that

281
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,610
you're suing for if you because as the

282
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,610
work gave you carpal tunnel and this is

283
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,390
just one of the many cases of how

284
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,830
American lawyers are used so this is

285
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,260
actually very critical to on this entire

286
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,090
talk because a lot of these security

287
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,580
companies have to do in with legal

288
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,060
battles okay because information

289
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,310
security companies they don't protect

290
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,490
against getting hacked they protect

291
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,040
against from being sued all right this

292
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,990
is a huge concept because a lot of

293
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,730
people say like I'm hiring you so we

294
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,520
don't get hacked but it's mostly you're

295
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,070
hiring them so in if you've ever have to

296
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,230
deal with anybody else in court you can

297
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,870
say we did our best look over here at

298
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,480
set company all right so we'll go into

299
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,080
two case studies about this specifically

300
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,720
so the first one is the target versus

301
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,120
these banks now um when target gots to

302
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,470
compromise their pio that what if you

303
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,380
guys aren't familiar targets POS systems

304
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,780
the point of sales got up and

305
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,930
they started uh they lost huh I think a

306
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,140
hundred is the first projection was 110

307
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,690
million credit card information as long

308
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,070
as with people and um these banks had to

309
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,890
reissue new credit cards and debit cards

310
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,440
out and they had to do a lot of things

311
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,580
and this cost them money to do so so

312
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,110
because target was supposed to keep all

313
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,499
this in for

314
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,529
mation safe they then sue target this

315
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,149
was a big lawsuit they sued him for a

316
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,219
lot of money so at least five

317
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:29,799
plus bings got together to create

318
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:33,579
lawsuit ensue target for this they sued

319
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,969
for what's called punitive damages so

320
00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:40,269
these damages exceed simple compensation

321
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,419
and awards to publish the defendant

322
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:46,479
meaning that you know anything that the

323
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:49,419
banks had to pay out of we're going to

324
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:52,779
go after target for so the CEO this was

325
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:55,869
hand before you get fired um the banks

326
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,969
one and they won two hundred million

327
00:13:57,969 --> 00:14:00,909
dollars because they said that's how

328
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:03,039
much it cost them I don't know maybe it

329
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,319
was maybe it wasn't but you know again

330
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:08,169
you can see like how having a security

331
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:10,209
company to have prevented this bit of

332
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:11,979
you know save two hundred million

333
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:14,049
dollars so if you're a security company

334
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:18,189
and you you say hey if you give us a

335
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:20,469
million dollars will make sure you won't

336
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:23,139
lose two hundred million dollars and

337
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:24,819
this is how a risk assessment happens

338
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:26,049
we'll go a little bit more into that

339
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:28,689
later but this is a large part of of

340
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:32,859
security again protecting not from being

341
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:36,720
hacked for but by being sued all right

342
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,529
on that and yeah right on after the I

343
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:44,199
believe it was the new CEO if not or the

344
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:46,829
chief information security offers told

345
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:50,679
Congress that or the government we will

346
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,839
be hiring pen testers after this so

347
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,989
sorry about that and the the fact that

348
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:59,789
they are hiring pen tester is also huge

349
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:02,649
it's a huge public moves telling the

350
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:04,599
customers that you know we're doing our

351
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,239
best we're doing everything we can

352
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,399
that's you know the truth is yeah it's

353
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,909
like you just got hacked obviously

354
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:16,299
there's holes and the thing is target

355
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:17,829
knows about like most companies they

356
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:19,209
know that they have security holes they

357
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,629
know that over running PHP 5.2 where the

358
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:25,149
 we know we're running Apache you

359
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,999
know whatever we're running linux kernel

360
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,689
2.7 or two point whatever and they know

361
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:33,939
these things but what they do is they

362
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:36,759
analyze the risk so that he wondered

363
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,199
what's the percentage of us getting

364
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:41,829
hacked you know is it high medium low if

365
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:45,909
it's low then they won't do anything if

366
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:48,999
it costs them you know if it might

367
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,559
potentially cost them money they won't

368
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,239
do it so I always like to use Amazon as

369
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:57,669
reference so if an Amazon server goes

370
00:15:57,669 --> 00:15:59,589
down from the 30 minutes that's a few

371
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:02,409
million dollars so you can't have those

372
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:04,119
servers go down so you just leave those

373
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:06,159
vulnerabilities running you just leave

374
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,229
you just keep it running because if it

375
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:10,539
goes down on you're losing lots and lots

376
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:13,029
of money so it's just better to keep it

377
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:16,059
up because it'll cost you no less if it

378
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:20,019
gets hacked so and this is how pen

379
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:22,659
testers get hired pacifically by target

380
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:25,419
they're like oh you know um they got

381
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,009
hacked now you need pen testers were the

382
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:30,459
guy so at this point it's being best

383
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:32,559
friends with that see so whatever it's

384
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,029
like Oh our company will do that we're

385
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,529
really good friends with you and that's

386
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,599
how you get those big level contracts is

387
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:39,220
you know somebody or somebody knows

388
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,349
somebody and that's what those sales

389
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:43,389
teams are for so you hire your sales

390
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:46,389
team or people sales team who know

391
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:50,279
people in these big-ass company oh

392
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:53,679
alright this case number two so this is

393
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,429
the bank versus you this one's a little

394
00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:00,789
bit more interesting alright so a

395
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:02,559
company your brain has a legal

396
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,259
obligation legal obligation to protect

397
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:08,740
all customer information the plaintiff

398
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,119
or the victim has to prove beyond a

399
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,619
reasonable doubt and that's a big case

400
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,709
beyond a reasonable doubt that the

401
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:20,199
company was negligent that they messed

402
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:23,128
up in handling your personal information

403
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:24,849
and this can be pretty difficult

404
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,679
especially if you're not tech-savvy you

405
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,299
hire your lawyers to do this stuff and

406
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:30,669
if you don't have lawyers you become

407
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:32,830
tech savvy or figure figure out this

408
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,929
stuff you you can join a class action

409
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,500
lawsuit and say I was a victim and you

410
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,509
know it makes your case more powerful

411
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:43,059
when you have hundreds of or millions of

412
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,070
people that are on this class action

413
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,100
lawsuit right

414
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:53,230
okay so here we go so Bank you become a

415
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,990
victim of identity theft you can prove

416
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,910
at the bank was negligent that they

417
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,179
 up so the bank losses and you win

418
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:03,010
saying that the bank didn't do

419
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,330
everything they could they didn't do

420
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,820
this they didn't do that they only spent

421
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,230
this much money trying to protect their

422
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,000
servers didn't do a good job so bank

423
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,510
loses you win you get you get royalties

424
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,980
and anything else that it costs you so

425
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,500
if it costs you a lot of money to you

426
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,030
know get your new credit card it costs

427
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,040
of heartache you get all those back in

428
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,110
punitive damages as well as other types

429
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:28,510
of funds but um so but let's say in this

430
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,970
scenario the bank then hires a brand

431
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,929
protect or you know a protection company

432
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:39,970
so um this brand / tech company will say

433
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,850
they scan the entire internet for

434
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,820
phishing sites via code templates image

435
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,000
recognition and keywords they find this

436
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,780
phishing page let's table these domains

437
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,410
that they find they so they find a

438
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,700
fishing site like pink this Bank of

439
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,600
America one and then they send automatic

440
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,640
dmca X to the hosting providers as well

441
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,450
as the ISPs so this means you draft up a

442
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,390
letter doesn't have to be a specific

443
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,480
like legal format it just has to say

444
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,520
you're breaking the law this is

445
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,340
copyrighted content if you continue we

446
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,300
will pursue legal action um basically

447
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,130
saying we will sue you we will contact

448
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,230
you sue you and put you in jail it's

449
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:31,300
it's this huge threat so now the banks

450
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,550
but this bank hired brand / tech and

451
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,010
they say you know we're doing our best

452
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,340
we pay being protect 1 billion dollars a

453
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,070
year to protect you from getting hacked

454
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,070
and if they can do this and this is

455
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,170
proving without a recently this the

456
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,300
person cannot prove without a reasonable

457
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,850
doubt that they were negligent so the

458
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,040
negligent part just fades away because

459
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,950
the bank did everything everything that

460
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,429
they could and you lose you lose

461
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:01,749
any money that you lost from that bank

462
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:06,460
that's your fault now um so these banks

463
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,990
hire these security companies because

464
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,330
they're like insurance policies they

465
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,409
protect them from you suing them and

466
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:16,360
this is what a lot of security companies

467
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,860
are in the United States their their

468
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,350
legal protection um but as far as let's

469
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,929
say a brand protect it won't stop at

470
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:28,570
just phishing websites any website that

471
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,919
has legal content so this could be blogs

472
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,860
mobile app side so if you have if you

473
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,519
have an app store or a website where you

474
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,009
have videos if any of those contents are

475
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,799
owned and copyrighted by a US company

476
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,009
they will send dmca out to you they will

477
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:49,539
send it to your hosting provider and

478
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,820
your ISP saying like this person is

479
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,830
hosting a legal content if you don't

480
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,110
shut them down you're breaking the law

481
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,960
and they'll just keep going up so I send

482
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,549
you the hosting provider you're hosting

483
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:02,440
this website I say you need take this

484
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,549
down you're hosting a little information

485
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:05,950
you don't say nothing you don't do

486
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,600
anything you don't respond you go up to

487
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,730
your ISP we contact them so you're

488
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,039
hosting you're helping them host this

489
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,529
illegal content you're like legally

490
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:16,720
liable we're coming after you now and it

491
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,269
just goes up and up the food chain until

492
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:24,129
your servers off and this is this is I

493
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:25,779
think this is an issue simply because

494
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:28,269
the United States is going around to

495
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:30,369
other companies that are in different

496
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:32,590
locations of the company's sending out

497
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,340
these dmca X and you need to obey our US

498
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,600
law um you know some website like you

499
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,929
know if i do or other websites that have

500
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,369
streaming content they make a lot of

501
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:49,059
their money from traffic ads and you

502
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,379
know they don't have any malicious

503
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:52,869
intent they just are some person that

504
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:54,519
wants to have a website up and make a

505
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,029
few bucks and you know you have this

506
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:00,399
other big corporation of america

507
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:02,889
basically coming and saying you can't do

508
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:05,169
this this is our copyrighted content you

509
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:06,940
are breaking the law and we will come

510
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,549
after you we will find you in jail will

511
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:11,799
we will send our lawyers after you you

512
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,179
will owe us money and you will go to

513
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:14,620
jail

514
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,010
so yeah we got Hitler yeah you want to

515
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,490
see it all the dmca acts everywhere but

516
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,450
the most sickening truth to all of this

517
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:31,190
is that it's a fake threat um so what

518
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,210
happens is as you're sending out 200 so

519
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,820
I said you we send that automated dmca X

520
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,890
so you could do 200 300 400 DM CX a day

521
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,340
to all over the you anywhere that you're

522
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,809
targeting so if I have a client may be a

523
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:53,659
pokemon pokemon is my client and I see a

524
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:57,710
bunch of fake pokemon go um websites or

525
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,090
something where they're trying to steal

526
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,360
customer information i I just scan the

527
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,820
entire internet I see 500 instances of

528
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,309
these and then I I automatically send a

529
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:11,090
DMC x2 those 500 as a security company

530
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,970
we do not have that money to sue those

531
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,159
companies we don't have all those people

532
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,230
there's just not enough money out there

533
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,809
to expedite them so wherever they're

534
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:23,299
located let's say China we cannot send

535
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:28,730
our lawyers and our are whoever to to go

536
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,190
to contact their authorities arrest them

537
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,700
bringing them this United States pay for

538
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,130
the court battles and then eventually

539
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,889
put them in jail most almost every

540
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:42,710
single US company cannot do that so all

541
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,529
these dmca acts they're basically empty

542
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:47,690
gun the empty bullets they're in fake

543
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,510
breaths so they just do this so they

544
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,019
scare other companies or other people to

545
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:55,399
take down their content because they

546
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,200
don't want to deal with legal liability

547
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,880
they're afraid you know you're having

548
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,559
all these issues America's coming at you

549
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,380
it can be scary but it almost every

550
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,190
single time it's a fake threat um in

551
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,450
regards to like the Pirate Bay we're

552
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,480
bigger groups like that those ones are

553
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,909
not fake they real and are coming after

554
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:16,909
you and if you ever get that big you

555
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:19,309
need to hire lawyers be a little bit

556
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:21,610
more

557
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,450
okay ah I made a little flowchart of

558
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,250
exactly what happens so you receive it

559
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,280
dmca X and then you wonder are you in

560
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,070
the United States if you are not in the

561
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,510
if you are in the United States you

562
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,010
better comply or move the out that

563
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:23,539
country if you are not in the US um can

564
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:26,450
the copyrighted content holder lose lots

565
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,940
of money by host by you hosting your

566
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,860
content so is it something like

567
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,720
paramount where they're losing lots and

568
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,270
lots of money because every single

569
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,159
person wants to go to your site instead

570
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:40,610
of a movie theater if it's a no keep

571
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,789
doing what you're doing if it's a yes

572
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:46,970
the next question is going to be um can

573
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,450
they afford to you know do all the legal

574
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,429
things settle over yours extradite you

575
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:56,299
and bring you into court I forgot the no

576
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:59,630
but if they cannot pirate on if they can

577
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,850
you should either comply or move your

578
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,789
business because they will or they'll

579
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:07,340
take it down um simply said like they

580
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,230
will come after you and say you need to

581
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,390
take this down and it's a whole legal

582
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,049
ugly battle after that but um so yeah

583
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:17,600
Ian specifically in the United States I

584
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,830
I've noticed that there's a lot of

585
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,260
ethical hacking jobs ethical things

586
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,929
there's a lot of legal jobs as well but

587
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:26,390
there's just me there's just a tiny

588
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,179
sliver of ethical and legal jobs right

589
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:31,789
now i'm chillin over in academia and I'm

590
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:34,309
learning as much as I can because you

591
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:36,620
know I personally just want to learn as

592
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,480
much as I can to do as best I can

593
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,120
whatever it is I want to do but there

594
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,409
are a lot of companies out there that

595
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:45,140
you know you'll pay you will go sit you

596
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,330
in you'll have a nice job you get a

597
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,340
little plant on your desk and you just

598
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,309
hang out and relax but you know the

599
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:53,539
things that you're doing you might be

600
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:55,669
pushing down that little guy in another

601
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:58,610
country that you know you you might not

602
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,100
see the full spectrum of what happens

603
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,679
but um at least at the time when you get

604
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,990
hired but you know after working at the

605
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,220
company's for a while you'll start to

606
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,020
see and understand exactly what you do

607
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,789
and then from there you could really

608
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:12,140
decide if this is something that you

609
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,279
want to do

610
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,259
great yeah so you know how do these

611
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:20,249
security company start up like they just

612
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:23,279
don't spring out of Noah right yes and

613
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,879
no so there's something called vc's

614
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,889
venture capitalist and these people are

615
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:31,019
stupid rich they have lots of

616
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:34,619
money they are people that have millions

617
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,529
and millions of dollars or our companies

618
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:38,700
that have millions and millions of

619
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,249
dollars and you just you know you show

620
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:43,619
up and you just given them idea you say

621
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:47,099
I have this great idea I want to scan

622
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,969
the internet but I want to scan for all

623
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:54,149
the oldies malware collect them and then

624
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:56,099
have a database and then run tests and

625
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:59,969
you know do something right they got the

626
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,849
VCS are like I like this this is a great

627
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:06,450
idea um let's do it how much do you want

628
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,509
25 25 million sure sure it's fine take

629
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:12,509
it and then you're funded so then you

630
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:15,539
got your money seen money is the

631
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,269
beginning instagram started at five

632
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:19,919
hundred thousand dollars for their seed

633
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,469
money and then in one year they had

634
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:25,200
seven million dollars to go spend and

635
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,419
again like don't i know i'm just i

636
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:28,979
understand that Instagram security

637
00:28:28,979 --> 00:28:31,109
company but it's a it's a state it's a

638
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,419
it's a icon that we can use i'm sure

639
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:37,080
most people are familiar with it um you

640
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,299
know and jumping to spend seven million

641
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:41,820
dollars in less than a year when your

642
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,559
company is probably the size of that

643
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,080
room that you guys are sitting in right

644
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,089
now it's a lot of money to throw around

645
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:49,859
you're going to have some parties you

646
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:51,570
can have a lot of fun you can be in the

647
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,460
hardest San Francisco la you can do you

648
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,149
can be wherever you want um you know if

649
00:28:57,149 --> 00:28:59,519
it's an American venture capitalist

650
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:00,929
you're probably going to be in the US I

651
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:02,279
don't think they're going to want to

652
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,559
have a company outside the US they might

653
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,049
but um that's all legal things we're not

654
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:10,019
gonna go anywhere near that and then a

655
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:12,509
year later fifty million dollars you get

656
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:14,609
more money more money to blow more

657

size room that is you guys are sitting

659
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,639

661
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,039
money and everyone's happy and enjoying

662
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:26,880

663
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,500
here you go here's an actual security

664
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,659
company tenable in network security they

665

a few years later they got their second

669
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,890
series be and I maybe i should say these

670
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,419

671
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:51,760
loan money so they'll give you yeah take

672
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,460
50 million dollars whatever you need

673
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,860
take 250 million and turn this around

674
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,919
and we want you know a lot more back

675
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,580
