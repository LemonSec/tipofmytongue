1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510
hi everyone on michele pietravalle I

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:07,319
work to place the providers in this

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,599
place so venice some of you

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,400
know me yesterday's open talk or why never

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,759
saw me play with tesla last night so

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,970
let's say I take care of some

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,130
collateral things weight talk talk that I

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,650
presented to  June of this year on the

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,410
occasion of a completely different event, however, since

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,510
it was liked anyway I tried to

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,869
propose it again here she wrote maybe it is

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,170
a slightly different target audience

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,489
this is a talk in a probably

14
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,010
technical it was a talk more dictated to  lee co

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,719
commercial marketing that sector ii

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,700
which however had some pretty nice 20 technical books

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,690
entitled that

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,950
obviously internet traffic

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,320
following the evolution of the

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,629
streaming market that is what does this mean

21
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:58,920
in recent years as you well know

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,590
played in all quite years now

23
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,809
all  the offices the services such as netflix

24
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,790
download megavideo all those

25
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,420
legal and illegal things that are there how

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,610
these services have affected them  fleece

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,330
provider

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,810
so what can my notice that has

29
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,210
changed in recent years before seeing

30
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,450
these four graphs here are four

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,880
graphs it refers adds I

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,930
don't even remember when they were but they are

33
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,360
things are four graphs of

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,079
peering traffic of four internet changer three

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,259
big one small thing  we can see

36
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,290
in we can see something quite

37
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,829
interesting the arrow indicates on all

38
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,280
the graphs around 8 pm of the

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,390
same day

40
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,880
what happens around 8 pm you see the

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,770
traffic clearly from

42
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,380
around 5 am where the minor peak goes up

43
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,259
goes up then stabilizes then  if we live

44
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,990
there is always around 20 this peak

45
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,568
quite evident you see this

46
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:10,669
graphs

47
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,440
completely different scales here we are

48
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,470
talking by scale and gigabits per second

49
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,410
here we are talking to say this is a

50
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,209
50 gigabits per second here we are

51
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:21,980
talking in terabits per second

52
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,380
this graph is  of 4 terabits per

53
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,130
second

54
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,709
this is inter 100 gigabit this

55
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,170
even i  n megabytes here we are at 200

56
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,280
I read well drums

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,580
all have this

58
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,610
particular trend towards dinner time

59
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,410
what does this mean simply

60
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,970
means that people come home from

61
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,489
work they start to eat and start

62
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:48,500
watching something steaming and after

63
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,660
dinner  during dinner something quite

64
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,090
interesting you see the graphs are

65
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,860
overlapping but they all have the

66
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,030
same characteristic curve looking at it

67
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,709
on its area no longer the daily

68
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,959
this in the daily area this is a

69
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,480
weekly area we see that

70
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,560
the trend is good or bad there is all

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,470
days the arrow actually

72
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,489
indicated something quite more evident you see they

73
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,140
are all more or less aligned here there is

74
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,299
a corresponding peak always

75
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,329
around that time very very

76
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,859
important remember that the scale in

77
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:32,630
cigarettes faces there was a  increase

78
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,040
of about 57 50 gigabits per second

79
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,590
this moment this particular

80
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,120
time slot of the day June 14th what was

81
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,769
what happened  or in your opinion at that

82
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:48,890
moment it simply happened to

83
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,799
the belgium italy match

84
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,790
what does this mean it means that

85
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,980
when once people watched

86
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,920
television they watched it so they listened to

87
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,799
the radio so the vendors heavy with the pc and a

88
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,510
half the vendor or in any case the

89
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,400
main service providers  of the time who were

90
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,200
the usual classic ones allowed

91
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,810
someone at random how it is evolving

92
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,978
instead now we are moving from these

93
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:22,130
devices here to these devices here to

94
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,040
see

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,980
and my audio my video streaming and

96
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,990
sell what we have passed from

97
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,110
those before that  they are the classic

98
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,600
television providers to these here if

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,060
I had a bit at random anyway just to

100
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,730
make the idea so the market is

101
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,460
starting has moved clearly from

102
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,560
a dimension we call logical wool the

103
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,430
digital dimension what impacts this

104
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,620
one comments impacts on a physical level

105
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,050
because  if in order to watch

106
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,360
analogue or digital terrestrial television

107
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,120
with some negligible difference,

108
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,050
I had b  i need this provider

109
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,120
side then repeater side this is

110
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,970
the user apt how the

111
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,430
situation on the user side has evolved now to

112
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,380
see me the influx in streaming and my

113
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,150
game my movie my what we

114
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,610
want I no longer need this

115
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,220
infrastructure  above but for

116
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,870
example I need these two

117
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,960
infrastructures motionless movement is

118
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,330
fixed this is one of the workers that

119
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,850
you have seen for the 20th around

120
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,530
all your cities

121
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,760
if I were the municipality I would never have

122
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,530
authorized such crap

123
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,970
rather make a hole  while the

124
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,740
underground shelter spain put me in there

125
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,810
here in mestre I refer to the

126
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,700
masters 200 meters there are these things

127
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,160
mounted in the middle of the sidewalk in front of

128
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,430
the gate just where the equal goes

129
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,430
well this therefore

130
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,520
fixed area this in the mobile area and side

131
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,540
instead not anymore  on the side of the sick user

132
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,660
provider we have gone from having this is

133
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,250
all that concerned directing

134
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,490
and so on basically to this one so

135
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,900
we no longer have  infrastructures

136
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,260
distributed throughout the territory but rather it was

137
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,450
a

138
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:16,850
clearly centralized screening infrastructure and what

139
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,650
substantially changed once if it was a

140
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,170
small amount of the content

141
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,720
available the programmer of the

142
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,940
television channel programmer the

143
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,530
current developer that programmer body

144
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,990
what program had its beautiful

145
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,210
archive of  tapes of what you

146
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,400
wanted took they decided what to

147
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,290
put and gave you the opportunity to

148
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,690
see that program then two programs

149
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,190
those three channels

150
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,960
now instead what changes now

151
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,610
permanently all available is

152
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,790
the user who decides what to see

153
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,230
then how you change what has changed at the

154
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,330
level  information basically that

155
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,160
before from a flow that had been

156
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,780
logical digital what you want

157
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,580
television that made me exit from

158
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,800
limpe from the studio in transmission to

159
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,500
the repeater up to the user now

160
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,360
clearly the flows have become

161
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,190
hundreds of thousands millions because

162
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,030
obviously each operat  hours that each

163
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,680
user goes he chooses what he wants to

164
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,750
see and surely it will not coincide with

165
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,940
what another is treating with all

166
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,220
the necessary exceptions to optimize

167
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,780
space so on the user side on the provider side

168
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,480
we have arrived at this situation

169
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,270
the user apt therefore provider vars users

170
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,890
do not  we have more antennas then we have

171
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,600
the columns that I

172
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,690
showed them and on the other hand the last mile they

173
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,370
call this way towards the user we have

174
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,320
things in the area the stop saw the

175
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,110
wired columns in the mobile area

176
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,380
we have this bts what is there but you

177
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,140
can't see why  my cell phone in my

178
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,270
pocket 4g hate you never make me 40 megabits per

179
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,790
second does not even know how many it makes

180
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,950
how nice it worked as I tell everyone

181
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,810
I key work in the field of wifi yes

182
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,820
wireless wireless hand because the children are

183
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,560
not there for the children from  someone else

184
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,570
me in this case the work find in

185
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,790
this case so what does it mean it

186
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,350
means that to

187
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,520
make mobile infrastructure scalable

188
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,910
I certainly have to bring fiber  emit

189
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,830
equipment of this kind the coveralls

190
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,970
also all in all

191
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,650
limited that for those of mestre there is a

192
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,640
map of the arpav with coverage of a

193
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,800
cellular abs so just to understand

194
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,900
this always on a being is the map

195
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,479
of the bs always from the site  and the arpav of the

196
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,099
bsd I do not remember if all the

197
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,169
operators or only some positioned

198
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,849
you see that is there are a lot of bsa to be

199
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,740
able to provide you with the connection

200
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,860
so there is a whole world behind the

201
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,400
I watch the movie in streaming on the

202
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,490
mobile phone that the user  final does not even

203
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,740
realize it does not even know that it is there it is completely ignored

204
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,670


205
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,360
so what it means essentially

206
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,530
means a lot of data a lot of cells

207
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,920
this is a car I made a

208
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,090
few days before the presentation

209
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,760
of the mountain in Sardinia that we have

210
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,750
repeaters in the space of a year and a half

211
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,140
they added this is our third

212
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,450
high school wifi for the annex added these

213
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,960
these these these because I need

214
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,690
to carry bana I have to do smaller cls

215
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,270
I have to carry many  more bs for the same

216
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,640
for the same type of service

217
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,200
let's do the math just grizzly

218
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,000
netflix that what the data

219
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,670
published a little maybe 34 quality

220
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,550
low medium high and ultra hd what

221
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,430
does this affect what I do it to you

222
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,410
I transfer it to the

223
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,340
knightley servers  I do it about 0.3 gigabytes

224
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,860
per hour go you not vitamin command it

225
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,650
means that I look at me it is an hour of team

226
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,130
mark 300 megabytes of traffic

227
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,560
average quality actually means sd better and

228
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,740
refers to normal television locations

229
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,600
reference almost a gigabit a  gigabytes

230
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,450
per hour high quality we are at 3 gigabytes

231
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,870
per hour it is ultra hd 7 gigabytes per hour

232
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,750
so we have a number of traffic that

233
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,010
we are going to move which is really

234
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,460
important that we do not even give in to

235
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,380
imagine

236
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,200
we do the math a little faster

237
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,520
about a movie in streaming  we are at 6

238
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,380
megabits per second about very

239
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,780
spannometric it means that I will have 6

240
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,010
megabits that arrive at miur ucan

241
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,630
making an estimate of how many users there

242
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,610
may be  eras connected for a

243
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,940
control unit of an operator of a street

244
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,280
of a zone comes out an account that

245
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,670
was about 384 megabits per second that

246
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,590
come out of my cab

247
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,530
clearly the cups are about 100 for

248
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,000
central comes a small neighborhood

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,020
etc. it

250
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,970
means that my central  in

251
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,950
short, remittances

252
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,050
of the city go to the

253
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,600
collection center in my central unit between gigabits per second

254
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,210
simply with a few users who

255
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,610
in the evening look via the internet

256
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,130
well 3 gigabits a neighborhood a small

257
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,960
neighborhood we are not talking about a

258
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,640
building where maybe we have the only one

259
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,070
200 people watching him towards

260
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,640
netflix instead clearly that mind

261
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,210
depends on a million factors this

262
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,660
cartoon is quite significant well

263
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,270
now solved his bandwidth problem

264
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,030
ok daily is not the solution

265
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,940
that can be adopted because honey clicks

266
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,480
I do not know what spotify I say  at home I

267
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,510
can't have a big pipe so it

268
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,910
brings me the internet in my data cent  er yes I

269
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,070
can have it I must obviously have it

270
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,630
is not the solution that allows me to

271
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,370
numerically scale the problem of the

272
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,610
capillarity of the users what is the

273
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,280
solution that went to apply for

274
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,360
example netflix

275
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,519
for snai clicks not because it is connected

276
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:19,010
to them in any way indeed  but

277
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,450
simply because what the

278
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,540
clearest published data

279
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,850
netflix solutions is is a classic appliance they

280
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,839
will call open connect appliance and it

281
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,480
seems to me an insecure 5 rack unit

282
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,380
tarech have managed to make us fit a lot of

283
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,399
stuff because there are 36 hard drives and 8

284
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,110
terabytes v6 from  a terabyte been alone

285
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,420
more back series of things them

286
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,070
these what they simply do are the

287
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,470
classic cash servers like google as

288
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,649
has them akamai as have them practically

289
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,420
all those and fan content delivery

290
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,690
so what do you say instead of

291
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,810
bringing me operator mille the rabbit

292
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,670
band  and my data center from here I do

293
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,839
the distribution of all

294
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,000
I periodically push my

295
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,760
contents on these devices  itives

296
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,279
scattered around the world where clearly

297
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,140
surely in the points with the big

298
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,029
providers or in the internet exchanges

299
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:25,130
so they had to hurt the providers and

300
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,130
so whoever did my occupation of the

301
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,380
first level and then distribution to

302
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,070
the user these devices deal with these devices

303
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,839
here we have 296  terabytes of disk space

304
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,570
that is what you have fix it deems

305
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,870
appropriate to have all the content

306
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,519
most in use clearly because I am going to

307
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,350
do all the non-existent tests

308
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,890
of content pilused close to the customer

309
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,510
how do I get it this I am an

310
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,360
operator providing very simple spi

311
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,360
just ask for it  if or at least 5 gigabits of

312
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,699
average traffic to netflix the task

313
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,589
the forum I wait a few days but

314
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:10,100
this nice toy arrives at home

315
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,630
clearly after stopping a thousand

316
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,010
cards that I am not going to open them to

317
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,680
disassemble them the distribution of contents things

318
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
that are clearly deplorable and we

319
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,520
do not  we will never

320
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,230
unfortunately I did not have an otherwise I would have

321
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,510
brought it here yes I'll bring it to you

322
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,490
they change en masse and I know it I know

323
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,790
very

324
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,150
well so this is the solution yes how

325
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,910
there is this there is the solution this were

326
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,240
the first that google gave you in the old

327
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,100
days and if I do not even know if google tv

328
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,880
is more this stuff

329
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,750
or what  akamai does the same thing also

330
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,580
these are ancient archive photos

331
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,170
still the flop of this is right to

332
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,760
understand well

333
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,290
said this the solves the problem

334
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,570
operators are my legal operator and

335
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,130
two for legal means used

336
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,410
authorized unloading I pay the rights and the

337
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:05,380
usual things  that of course we are

338
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,620
perfectly in agreement you have to do it

339
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,940
and all the others

340
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,510
really happen you all know

341
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,700
megavideo all those beautiful

342
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,830
streaming services not really complex the

343
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,640
copyrights and those and this ip tv

344
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,210
test now you have 4000 movies tv series on

345
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,210
demand is all streaming to skyhighs

346
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,000
all possible channels in the world to

347
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,370
premiums even testing is free if you want to

348
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:36,850
try

349
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,950
I don't know if you know them you pay them like

350
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,430
15 dollars a month 30 dollars a m  ese

351
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,170
according to the service you want that they

352
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,080
give me practically all the

353
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,970
premium premium channels theses I do not predict

354
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,330
operators but all those expresses in bb

355
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:57,250
tv this clearly is what

356
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,310
runs away because obviously I operator of

357
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,590
this service that every server in I

358
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,470
do not want to know where I can not  go

359
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,630
artfully he appliance to your home and see

360
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,700
that in this way the rite to pirate users

361
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,730
download they eat the internet

362
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,840
this is the fundamental problem because

363
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,940
he is the fundamental problem because he runs away

364
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,180
from optimization systems is not that he is

365
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,490
skilled you do not know where he comes from so

366
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,410
maybe he comes from a  lost operator

367
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,990
passes pliny peeling at 10 megabit

368
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,470
instead of the one at 10

369
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,240
gigabit you cannot organize a bit

370
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,970
problematic just to understand it

371
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,900
I apologized I was looking at a

372
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,480
small, very fast analysis that I had

373
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,580
done of the traffic of one of my

374
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,450
operators in the evening if  i dont

375
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,410
remember in person some time i had

376
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,830
pulled down on madame pato and about 670 4

377
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,280
gigabit bikes  they are gigabytes these are and

378
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,230
streaming traffic this is no longer

379
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,369
just that it captures everything that passes they

380
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:08,960
have been 100 gigabytes it is an analysis

381
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,940
this made me a little worried

382
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,079
because a simple flash that identifies it

383
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,880
all that is

384
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,470
megavideo etc. then when the

385
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,329
first  patient however about the

386
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,560
movie streaming via flash 24 per cent and

387
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,859
so much sopcast that here does not call it I know

388
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,480
this is not what I had the times

389
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,270
the sopcast labels so everything

390
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,160
we had seen before in here

391
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,180
69 per cent so 70 plus 24 is 94

392
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,860


393
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,320
3.1 percent streaming this captures me all

394
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,060
that is legal traffic so

395
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,020
youtube then sky go so those things

396
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,810
there impressive this number get

397
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,540
stressed this is a network of about a thousand

398
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,350
users in total and a provider

399
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,070
in central Italy we have not been name

400
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,650
anyway that  absolute residential

401
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,480
but I think I have no business user

402
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,930
this interesting this number because it

403
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,060
means that the situation is there  a little

404
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,580
getting out of hand it hit the stadiums

405
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,950
minds june this then june of

406
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,080
this year so definitely after

407
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,650
the arrival of netflix

408
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,750
I don't know if here I maybe caught the only

409
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,160
moment when everyone was

410
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,770
watching his latest movie just released on

411
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,200
megavideo  it could also be I receive

412
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,730
the capture made on the fly just to

413
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,800
make the slide maybe if I make

414
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,480
a capture on the slightly wider range of

415
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,830
verses but the numbers come out

416
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,850
definitely

417
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,039
they at this I do not know is a number

418
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,750
that I have seen for  case it jumped at my

419
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:53,120
eye mission slide well the impact

420
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:01,520
to this is an analysis made by cisco which

421
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,980
predicts the trend in the next 3 4

422
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,080
years or so where digital media adapter

423
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,970
means the number of connected devices that

424
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,520
can stream me it means

425
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,760
everything means  to say apple tv means

426
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,370
raspberry everything that is connected and

427
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,190
you allow me to stream and input

428
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,820
the number from 2016 to 2020 you see it is

429
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,950
practically not saying it has doubled but

430
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,130
we are passing to 141  million

431
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,650
devices and 242 million

432
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,600
important fact let's look at the impact of

433
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,070
traffic this is actually aggregate traffic

434
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,140
as you can see we are

435
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,789
talking about 80 to 2020 from 2016

436
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,850
I am learning about 180 what is the

437
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,840
premise bike so this what it means it

438
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,059
means  substantially that for the

439
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:58,130
future we will certainly need to focus

440
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,070
more on delocalizing traffic to

441
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,169
say how telecom is doing telecom has done

442
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,690
telecom for those who are informed a year

443
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,419
ago what did it do two years ago now

444
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:10,789
who acted as a peeling manger be

445
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:13,100
decidedly against this because

446
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,080
clearly who or service providers

447
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,270
must buy the pd that with telecom and

448
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,390
direct if he wants to reach users

449
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,919
recently otherwise he goes around

450
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,039
frankfurt for jesolo he knows where it is

451
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,150
clearly around the

452
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,059
esabyte bottleneck expected in a

453
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:31,510
few years of difference

454
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,460
this is enough  slide went to the end I know

455
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,919
that the power point of the mei that that

456
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,270
of the gray if they are not very com

457
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,929
patibili asks questions about it

458
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:49,360
very well thank you
