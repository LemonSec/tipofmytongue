1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,049
hello everyone i'm daniele martino

2
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:07,709
this is let's say a trailer of

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,340
another talk that i will do cpu 6

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,940
later at 19 in the mickey mouse tent and

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,359
they asked me let's say to make a

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,890
list of the summary just to give a

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,449
minimum of production then who  is

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:25,890
interested comes who is not interested

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,668
does not come and let's say in this tool that

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,540
I tried to summarize the things I

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,520
learned in the last year trying to

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,620
understand a bit how the foot six works

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,670
and the tool which is quite long because

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,440
the last time  I did it by reading

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,930
all the slides I think I have it

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,579
lasted about two hours

17
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,489
but in the esc version, let's say I'll

18
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,850
cut a lot of things to

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,030
try and fit it in less than an hour because

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,010
let's say I've heard a lot of

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,950
presentations on  ipv6 in the years that

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,080
have disappointed me in the sense that we talked a

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,900
lot to the two 128 bits

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,299
then there are these addresses these

25
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,850
other addresses finished and then in reality

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,530
when you put yourself on a keyboard must

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,140
configure an if  rver and you realize

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,420
that you do not really know how it works

29
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,979
then I took a couple of books including

30
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:34,439
one of the rai hours and which I think is

31
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,020
called ai pvsec saint georges and melo

32
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,799
I looked at a bit and let's say as a student I

33
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,780
pulled out the salient parts of the  book

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,590
and he made these slides with it and many

35
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,980
think

36
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,000
that pv six is complicated or that it has

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,760
magical things that are no longer there 4

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,600
actually the protocols are very similar

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,970
the fact that many things that there are

40
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,950
more four since they were

41
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,810
introduced  we have never ever used it

42
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,180
for example multicast that is it is used but

43
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,840
relatively little and then we say many,

44
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,130
that is, it takes courage to do this

45
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,290
talk because I know that many people in the

46
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,680
group see unit miss which is where it is

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,950
that made the recital run  gay.tv

48
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,610
six [ __ ] to say and so let's say

49
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,530
I wanted to hope to convince them too

50
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,930
that in reality it is nothing to be

51
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,680
afraid of it is in fact despite in the talk I

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,780
tried to stuff with all the

53
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,390
information I found I pun  I

54
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,760
did a slide at the beginning that I

55
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,150
called the pv six in 30 seconds in which

56
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,250
we say I list the main things that

57
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,540
in my opinion for someone who uses the computer

58
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,250
let's say very simple level are the

59
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,990
only things he is interested in knowing then

60
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,940
the others are let's say more  from sysadmin

61
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,650
then ipv6 to 128-bit addresses

62
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,739
instead of 32 and more on the four are 32

63
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,100
bits and are represented in

64
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,090
hexadecimal with this format that is

65
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,489
with hexadecimal digits in groups of

66
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:23,070
four separated by colons and

67
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,340
some programs for example written in c

68
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,360
directly  with sockets they must be

69
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,850
modified to use

70
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,230
af type sockets in six instead of iphone 4 ones

71
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,020
so if there are applications that

72
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,780
use low level that must be changed

73
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,239
if instead you use stuff like python I think

74
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,640
it is already in automatic use n 66 plus

75
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
four

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,830
let's say  the way to configure

77
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,390
the address that your

78
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,680
computer takes has undergone a somewhat

79
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,640
stormy story in the sense that at first

80
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,040
it was static then they  invented dhcp

81
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,460
but not for the write

82
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,470
then they added pieces and

83
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,930
nowadays dhcp is used and

84
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,480
basically enough in some rare case you

85
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,360
put static by hand 99 percent times

86
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,010
the advances in ipv6 dhcp was kept

87
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,850
that in fact dhcp v6 but exists  also

88
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,020
what is called

89
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,620
autoconfiguration, i.e. instead of

90
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,330
being my laptop asking for an

91
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,550
address from the network, it is the network that

92
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,610
broadcasts every few seconds but all saying

93
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,980
this is the prefix of the network I

94
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,690
receive it and I can build myself

95
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,760
the address without sending  a request

96
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,310
directly to a dhcp server and then years

97
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,440
plus four, arp is used which is

98
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,090
the mechanism that allows you to resolve

99
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:55,040
an IPI address in a mac address

100
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,380
because in order to send

101
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,540
a packet to the ethernet and wifi network card

102
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,210
you need to know the mac address

103
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,120
destination address this plus 4 was a

104
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,919
completely separate protocol

105
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,190
instead plus 6 was inserted inside

106
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,880
hayes fill in six which is the succes  sore

107
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,310
of at the time and then at the time it

108
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,660
also works with multicast mechanisms

109
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,630
that basically serve to reduce

110
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,020
the broadcast message in the network

111
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,520
i.e. on ipv4 it can often happen that

112
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,190
for things like art then whoever at an address

113
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,010
is not 168 01 sends a broadcast  from

114
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,470
everyone and if it is a very large network even

115
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,800
if it is peeled and there are many machines

116
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,330
that do it at the same time this

117
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,460
generates a lot of traffic and if you go and

118
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,900
search on the internet there are

119
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,300
documents of people who build data

120
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,070
centers who have this problem and have

121
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,919
he had to invent solutions to

122
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,840
solve this rain of broadcasts

123
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,169
and therefore in tv six it is all based on the

124
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:07,669
multi cash desk so that

125
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:09,650
small groups are created where to send messages

126
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,870
to avoid breaking the

127
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,250
boxes at all and then there is no nat

128
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,160
network address  translation even if in

129
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,050
reality then obviously it was invented

130
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,460
anyway also for ipv6 and there is no

131
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,740
need for in app on the more you are

132
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,360
in the sense that it was born  it was invented

133
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,830
as a mechanism to solve the

134
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,760
lack of addresses the problem of the

135
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,440
lack of addresses however there are

136
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,870
private addresses also on tv 6 so

137
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,690
if you have your home network

138
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,180
maybe you don't care that the printer

139
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,760
has joined v6 public accessible from the

140
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,909
internet you can use  a

141
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:58,159
unique local address as they are called ula is

142
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,349
that address to accessible

143
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:03,950
within a

144
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,830
broadcast domain or even link local

145
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,370
are also another mechanism for

146
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,120
just level 2 and even those are

147
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,560
like for example if I have to copy a

148
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,440
file

149
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,880
they passed to make another person attack

150
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,310
an ethernet cable and we already both have

151
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,230
a link local address automatically

152
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,139
and we can use it to exchange a

153
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,139
file so let's say the main things

154
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,389
are these addresses

155
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:34,040
the autoconfiguration then at the

156
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,580
leasing times and I have marked other things to

157
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,560
say  let's see if here is the agenda

158
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,190
and in the talk I will do an introductory part

159
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,240
in which par  a bit of the history of both

160
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,139
ipv4 and ipv6 because we say another

161
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:00,160
thing that I often didn't hear in talks was

162
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,750
because we have to pass more six because

163
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,310
everyone said is running out of

164
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,100
addresses we have to hurry up then talk

165
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,960
to someone else says but it's not true they

166
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,090
are not  ending and then I wanted to understand a

167
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,650
bit what the truth is

168
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,139
obviously the truth was a bit in the

169
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:17,660
middle now it has shifted a bit so

170
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,970
let's say we are in quite bad shape at the

171
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,720
moment but in yours we say taken

172
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,680
various statistics on what is the history

173
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
of the most locations  4 and how

174
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,809
the more 6 is evolving then I will talk a little

175
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,669
bit about the protocol the addresses that

176
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:41,750
are the main things the main thing

177
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,600
to know to plug servers

178
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,520
or so the addressing and then I will talk

179
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,970
a little about the various mechanisms to

180
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,410
mark addresses that are  sla that and

181
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:03,410
dhcp v6 and then in short there are several

182
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,080
details for example I know that many come

183
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,390
to tell me but I do not want to use ipv6 for which

184
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,400
then generates an address that has inside

185
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,910
my mac address is true however in 2016 if you

186
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,620
do not know it yet there are privacy

187
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,630
others that is your laptop when you

188
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,459
attack it with the eastern network that

189
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,430
assigns two more addresses 61 and

190
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,680
generated by the mac address and the other

191
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,540
instead is a  address that to the prefix

192
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,910
of the east network and suffix that is a

193
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,640
totally random thing and the random one

194
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,470
is always used for whatever

195
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,000
connection you make unless you remove it

196
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,190
then the operating system forced to

197
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,010
use the other so let's say I wanted to

198
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,329
make these things public too  that

199
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:48,140
maybe not everyone knows and then in the end

200
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:53,810
in the one as on the usl staff I will talk about

201
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,750
some details on for example the

202
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:02,290
transition mechanisms between ipv6 plus 4

203
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,650
for example the happy eyeballs mechanism

204
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,780
that is the fact that if you have ipv4 ipv6

205
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,970
on the same machine and the  your

206
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,850
browser or other applications could

207
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,770
choose to use one or the

208
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,420
other depending on the performance they

209
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,579
observe on the two protocols then it doesn't

210
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:30,530
come to mind  other to mention we have

211
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:38,750
something to do about the talk and then in short

212
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,180
if you have any questions I answer because

213
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,950
this is officially not a talk

214
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,160
because being an hour and the talks instead

215
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,510
have been for 18 minutes I could not

216
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,959
fit it so it is a caps but since

217
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,160
it seems to me the projector  I have to do it

218
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,910
in the marquee but let's say if if you have any

219
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,410
questions we try to do it a little

220
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,270
interactive also because precisely since there are

221
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,850
so many slides I don't know I don't know exactly

222
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,050
what this will cover if you want you can

223
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,120
start asking me if I will talk about a

224
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,070
certain topic and eventually

225
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,300
start looking for something  on the other hand there is

226
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,700
still a bit of a couple of hours of time

227
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,260
I can add a presentation

228
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,859
this is what

229
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,540
I wanted to know if it will talk about the

230
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,230
eni addresses that you anycast on the local network yes

231
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,900
however it is not that there is a lot to

232
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,420
say in the  sense that almost all

233
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,280
unique addresses can be ni cast there are

234
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,580
reserved ranges that I will show you later

235
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,200
but in reality then the mechanism for

236
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,690
let's say impleme  ntare the eni cast is a

237
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,550
separate thing from the more 6 there are various

238
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,150
mechanisms for example vrrp or other of

239
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,360
cisco that I don't remember the name or hrp

240
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,589
ok thanks
