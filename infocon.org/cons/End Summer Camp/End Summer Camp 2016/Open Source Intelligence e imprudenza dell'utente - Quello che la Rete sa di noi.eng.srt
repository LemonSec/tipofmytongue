1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,899
well in the meantime good morning everyone and who I

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,870
am so let's start from this and I

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,090
work in a detective agency

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,610
consequently with me as for this

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,250
reason I also deal with

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,640
digital investigations not to be confused with cola

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,590
forensics instead then digital

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,189
forensics and I am passionate in

9
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,289


10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,260
I write and for an online magazine I

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,880
collaborate with the chair of

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,120
legal informatics in Milan and I have been a

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,370
system engineer and technician for about

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,450
twenty years what I am here to

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,550
do today is instead to take you on a

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,370
path that I can explain to you  that

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,899
can make you understand what

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,020
logint is therefore open source intelligence

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,230
and and what tools open source

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,340
intelligence uses to get

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,970
to people's information and

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,850
we will also see the types of shots typical

23
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,869
of online users' mistakes the talk

24
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,680
in fact the title is  what the network knows about

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,290
us the imprudence of the user what

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:22,939
we will talk about we

27
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:26,640
will see logint so that elsewhere it is

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,140
nothing but the ac  onimo of open surce

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,570
intelligence the tools the techniques

30
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,520
but above all what is the

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,220
biggest danger for those involved in

32
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,020
computer science which is the human factor

33
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:48,320
kahlil gibran a lebanese philosopher poet

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,299
once wrote this reveals to the

35
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,979
wind your secrets you must not then

36
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,409
reproach  in the wind of revealing them to the

37
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,860
trees you immediately understand what

38
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,369
this means and this is also the sentence

39
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,890
reported at the beginning of a book a

40
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,940
manual explore the internet by

41
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,099
leonida rita believe that he is the president

42
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,480
of the investigative journalism association

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,730


44
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,700
and the council among other things  to those of you who are

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,470
interested in open source

46
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,280
intelligence and also defines the

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,840
first manual on

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,270
very complex open source intelligence then there are

49
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,250
a number of other documents on the net

50
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,360
but as a manual in which

51
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,250
some things are also summarized I took them right

52
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,489
dal is certainly an excellent an excellent

53
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,670
manual

54
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,239
let's frame the problem on the web

55
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,550
personal data at risk from cybercrime  me down to

56
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,320
500 million consider that cybercrime has

57
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,209
increased 30 percent this

58
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,290
year compared to last year

59
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,170
well before talking about open source

60
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,130
intelligence

61
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,920
let's take a step back what it is, that is,

62
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,819
what are the phases the 5 phases normally

63
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,360
that take place in  an

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,350
intelligence procedure not in an

65
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,299
intelligence activity cell humint human

66
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,610
intelligence is an activity that we say

67
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:28,310
useful forever on some note for

68
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,340
the management of the network of

69
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,060
human informers therefore the informers who make

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,040
intelligence then precisely the management of

71
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,200
these informers then  the news that

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,930
brings us is called activity of rivers

73
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,440
then there is the demanding sigint instead

74
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,390
deals with the interception of

75
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,519
communications li ning and from the

76
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,299
processing and analysis of images taken

77
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,230
by satellites from spy planes it is now

78
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,480
lately from logi drones we will see it

79
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,209
shortly  open source intelligence

80
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,709
therefore all those activities aimed at

81
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:17,488
obtaining information from networks,

82
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:21,539
let's say open by public r  eti il

83
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:23,360
magint as the fifth phase

84
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,060
of intelligence and deals with analyzing

85
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,010
the radiological spectrographic chemical signatures

86
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,470
of weapon systems and vectors

87
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,910
that can harm national security

88
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,790


89
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,020


90
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,190


91
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,680


92
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,870
what the

93
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,880
login activity of

94
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,590
information retrieval from open sources

95
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,200
let's see better what it is is a

96
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,570
method of investigation was born within

97
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,750
the secret services and is among other things

98
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,840
very powerful among other things we design is

99
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,060
very powerful because  thanks to users

100
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,910
it is becoming more and more even

101
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,169
within

102
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:09,180
intelligence organizations its contribution is

103
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,340
between 80 and 90 percent of the

104
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,150
entire information collection is

105
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,040
a refined and complex methodology

106
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,630
that therefore transforms data and

107
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,820
information separately  apparently

108
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,520
disconnected from each other and the experts in

109
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,750
any area of the network, therefore

110
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,510
including the deep web and and transforms it i  n

111
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,340
a coherent framework that is significant on

112
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,140
the investigative level, in

113
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,590
brackets I put criminal because as

114
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:44,250
we will see, as we will see, logint shares

115
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,050
the tools and techniques that

116
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,750
we will then go to it in a very synthetic way

117
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,919
to see it shares with the king with

118
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,229
penetration testing with

119
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,030
investigative journalism with  the

120
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,729
classic investigations with intelligence what

121
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:02,910
are the tools and procedures this

122
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,490
also serves to make us understand that

123
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,750
tools and techniques are not born

124
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,850
negative or positive but it is the use that we

125
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,710
go to make that identifies them as such

126
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,490
in order to be defined osint a '  activity

127
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,229
must have precisely the requisites and which

128
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:24,000
ones must use

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,720
unclassified information information acquired in

130
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,750
a lawful way so no to king no

131
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,100
wiretapping an espionage

132
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,680
if we want to define it osint however the

133
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,630
techniques are then also used

134
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,680
for other types of activities

135
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,220
public actions are used is  a

136
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,080
systematic methodical activity subject to

137
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,430
evaluation  ion must be useful to

138
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,320
answer these

139
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,350
intelligence and investigative questions is a very

140
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,240
important premise to make that

141
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,090
lawes int open source intelligence

142
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,889
should not be confused with an open source operating system

143
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:01,289
or with all those software that

144
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:03,600
are open source where for open source an

145
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,050
operating system a  free software

146
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,090
the open source intelligence and concerns the

147
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,380
public sources we access and to

148
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,889
do so lodging also provides

149
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:21,240
free activities but also of the non-

150
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,539
free paid type let's see then

151
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,669
what are the techniques many of which

152
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:32,009
I am already convinced indeed certainly there

153
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,110
with them  do you know precisely why the

154
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,800
techniques are shared by dalla king

155
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,940
from penetration testing

156
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,880
we start from the king of search engines

157
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:52,020
google google and if you look at us

158
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,380
we will see if you look at the source and beats

159
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,099
but if about one billion and 600

160
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,680
million visitors in August 2016 and it is

161
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,599
let's say the most used

162
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,349
search engine google has a double problem

163
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:09,570
regarding privacy deg  the users

164
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,900
and therefore

165
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,910
the our information that remains on the

166
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,500
network

167
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,810
the first is that with hacking tools you

168
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,889
call google a king

169
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:25,370
or google dork we will go to

170
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,860
retrieve the information

171
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,570
simply by making queries on

172
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,309
the search engine

173
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:38,700
in addition but google  with all

174
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,820
its beautiful cine applications it collects a

175
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,130
lot of information about us and

176
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,050
what many do not think and that when

177
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,850
we connect to google to access

178
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,890
e-mails and then we go to do some

179
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,330
research

180
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,930
or we use hangouts for a

181
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,640
videoconference  all these things

182
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,240
remain in google

183
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,339
and then it will use them and for

184
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,190
targeted advertising or even probably who can

185
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,580
say it for those who are selling it to some

186
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,700
advertising company well let's see how it

187
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,310
can be useful and how

188
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,110
google used for osint activity how many  of

189
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,550
you have ever tried to put

190
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,470
your name and surname in quotes on

191
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,350
google

192
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,680
well you realized something that

193
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,880
unexpected  ate un bye did not

194
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,060
even remember anymore that they appear

195
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,320
crazy so that social networks never come

196
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,450
out all but also the single

197
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,080
tweets that are put associations

198
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,640
where one works addresses

199
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,230
telephone numbers from the lists the white pages

200
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,200
on the fortissime from this point of view  given

201
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,540
the contributions first home there are the

202
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,490
funding the tenders so

203
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,380
simply by putting a name and surname

204
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,220
on google

205
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,050
we come to know many of those things the

206
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,180
advanced techniques that I told you

207
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,480
advanced techniques that are nothing more than queries

208
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,150
performed on the search engine but google

209
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,800
but similarly also to da sui others that

210
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,620
with advanced tools and strings

211
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,700
you go to both

212
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,540
retrieve information on subjects

213
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,650
let's say natural persons

214
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,400
legal persons but also it is widely

215
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,620
used for the penetration

216
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,750
testing phase to understand vulnerabilities

217
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,390
in fact penetration testing  the use

218
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,710
of google docs is perhaps one of the

219
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,470
activities that are always done on c  dares

220
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,420
the google docs are based I have put some

221
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,370
but man and there are so many

222
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,839
also on the net there is a lot of

223
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,270
documentation on this on

224
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,940
special characters the typical gold land the

225
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,370
quotes the minus the tilde and

226
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,790
the asterisk where we say those maybe

227
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,710
less used are the tilde to

228
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:10,190
find synonyms let's say of words

229
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,790
at least to remove from the query

230
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,710
something that we do not want

231
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,110
the results to appear as instead

232
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,560
search operators that can among

233
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,760
other things also the power of google

234
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,220
doc that can be combined both

235
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,460
characters  which operators between them are the

236
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,910
ones you see in the text then all

237
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,270
inter which is another operator but which

238
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,160
always concerns the category of the

239
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,880
inter type all inn texas inter we

240
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,920
will find all the documents that have

241
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,960
to do and have the word osint

242
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,580
all  'internal title is something that

243
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,500
instead goes to look in the title tag

244
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,540
of the web page and consequently to

245
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,960
those who are the titles come out,

246
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,320
among other things, very famous  el index of

247
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,260
then title index of come out

248
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,010
all the directories that it finds in short

249
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,220
google index of mp3 come out all

250
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,500
the mp3 directories so this very

251
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,450
convenient handy in a scream and often

252
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,460
used to find let's say that for

253
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,680
logint if these examples here are not

254
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,600
very fitting on the in screams for example

255
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,060
with the login precisely aspol admin point php

256
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,220
which is used to find all those sites

257
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,420
that have beliefs in the

258
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,610
log in pages to enter the

259
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:46,610
platform and the osint lin url can

260
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,560
still be useful because we want to

261
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,000
look for something  to be exactly

262
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,680
inside the war of a site

263
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,190
here we come we come be

264
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,840
the cache is useful

265
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,400
the word says so what can

266
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,980
be used the last cash registered by

267
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,850
google of a site the site

268
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,760
very useful this to see all the

269
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,490
subdomains of a site  domain so what do I

270
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,060
know

271
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,360
site site punto.it will show me site

272
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,830
punto.it but will also show me

273
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,670
director spunto site punto.it

274
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,150
commercial punto  site punto.it etc.

275
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,010
but I can also use a word before for

276
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,600
example contacts site site.it finds me

277
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,690
those pages of the site punto.it which has

278
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,470
the word contact

279
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,340
the fai type says the term identifies

280
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,880
that type of characters and that type of

281
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,360
type  of file so what do I know filetype

282
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,780
pdf finds me everything that has

283
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,110
as type of pdf file pdf extension

284
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,550


285
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,320
if I already put cv filetype doc it finds me

286
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,240
to all those who are cv files

287
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,920
puntodoc the google docs are powerful

288
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,140
because there is  ability to

289
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,200
automate queries and then automatically

290
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,940
find ready-made ones in fact when

291
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,650
kato a site that purely many of you already

292
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,110
know where they are

293
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,250
depending on what one has to do that I am

294
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,360
username and find the files of users

295
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,350
and  password

296
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,020
then go to lime user name and password and

297
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,520
pulls out the queries to be made by combining

298
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,590
characters of search operators

299
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,570
here we enhance the tool even more

300
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,520
I made some examples below

301
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,130
all inn texas sinda  co of venice

302
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,720
finds me everything I want to find

303
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,130
out I know what his name is mayor of

304
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,810
venice I don't know enough this simple

305
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,550
query finds me all the pages it

306
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,140


307
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,570
says mayor of venice surely it will be written mayor of venice pinco

308
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,350
pallino no mario rossi  filetype

309
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,940
colon doc finds me all the doc files that

310
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,840
have mario rossi inside the site

311
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,050
site punto.it minus site director punto

312
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,490
site.com and venezia finds all

313
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,300
subdomains of the site punto.it except

314
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,250
the director does not show it to me.  site

315
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,780
point 50 written paragraph and tir typo and the

316
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,630
venice narrows even more the search shows

317
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,820
me those that have to do

318
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,699
with venice so probably

319
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:38,069
venice offices rather than the site

320
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:44,579
point pt here we say here with this

321
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:47,639
we finish what are the techniques of

322
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,859
google dorking of advanced techniques

323
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:52,470
no of google I told you however that then there is

324
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,239
also the other side the other aspect of

325
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:56,970
google which is what stores our

326
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,649
information I took some common ones

327
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:04,439
let's say a very

328
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:08,699
comfortable one of the very comfortable screens of yes magazine where I laughed

329
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,279
really summarizes the thing then

330
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,199
starting from the fact that the online users

331
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,350
in the world are three billion 271 and 228 if

332
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,679
I use gmail and google second I

333
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,899
had to register to open

334
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,389
gmail as long as I did  the honest i

335
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:29,069
had to put my name and surname address

336
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:31,319
date of birth is those

337
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:34,529
yellow information to google sex age and

338
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:37,009
place

339
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,779
but not only 6 i use chrome and i do my

340
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,329
youtube searches rather than maps

341
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:46,049
google will know where i had to go

342
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,059
on vacation what i listen to  what i like

343
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:53,730
and what i watch where i work not only with

344
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,179
lang out and the google calendar could

345
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,720
know who i talk to who i am who

346
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,989
is my network of contacts from where how

347
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,459
long

348
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:10,189
do we talk what we write so imagine

349
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:14,309
shopping and wallet instead they will make us

350
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:16,439
understand where  let's make google understand

351
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,388
where we shop

352
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:21,059
how much we spend what we like in short,

353
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,658


354
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:26,490
etc. I have indicated for those who do not  he

355
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,010
knew a very useful

356
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,130
country-specific search engine let's say it's

357
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,120
a directory of

358
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,520
is a list of specific search engines

359
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,030
divided by area but there

360
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,530
are further filters that can be

361
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,420
done so what do I know and also there and also

362
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,380
in the language

363
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,940
I want to do  a search in japanese

364
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,860
because i am able to do it i'm going to

365
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,840
catch a japanese search engine

366
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,570
and i will usually be able to do it otherwise the

367
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,540
search engine has optimized based on

368
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,170
dns based on other factors they optimize and

369
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,810
localize

370
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,550
google results if you even if not

371
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,680
you probably ask him often the

372
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,180
results only in Italian

373
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,310
if you want those in English to

374
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,710
keep specifying it in the language if

375
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,270
you want to go directly to the site instead

376
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,030
a search engine that is located

377
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,280
in japan is obviously write in

378
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,860
japanese life surely you have

379
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,699
solved you have overcome this problem

380
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,640
seal those who already know seal

381
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,120
someone is the one we know without

382
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,150
having to study seal that is going to

383
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,950
fingerprinting organization with

384
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,580
collected archivist what ff does it is

385
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,870
phenomenal to understand from the metadata of the

386
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,530
files that it finds on a site how many

387
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,930
computers per year

388
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,640
who are the people who work

389
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,160
there because you understand very well that

390
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,810
if I agree I make my own fi bed

391
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,540
they put it and serve it  or we

392
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,810
publish it on the south on the site and I

393
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,330
did it I will come out the pc this the pc

394
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,880
erian di antonio made by antonio is

395
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,680
when little thing does he downloads all the files

396
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,710
he finds on the sites then at analyzes the

397
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,700
metadata he pulls them out and me  will

398
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,440
show and it is in this case I did

399
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,520
the yen seal summercamp of the site he

400
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,550
pulled out only two pdf documents

401
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,290
he also failed by analyzing the metadata

402
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,910
to understand a bat in which users

403
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,180
in the folders in the pc but on live

404
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,720


405
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,870
I guarantee the  I did for the municipality of Venice,

406
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,520
he pulled out the operating systems

407
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,570
that had in fact then surprising that

408
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,070
how many administrations still use

409
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:04,650
windows 98 for example and therefore

410
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,049
id operating systems  people who wash themselves

411
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:10,280
working inside the photos very

412
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,030
interesting for the photos

413
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,850
even manage to define sorry

414
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:20,520
I have for the photos manage to define

415
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,870
beyond that if there is the

416
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:26,190
active localization also that but also the type

417
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,220
of car that blues that  has produced

418
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,559
or device in short, device that

419
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:37,730
produced the photo another programmone

420
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,500
in fact the people I fly over because we

421
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,750
would not need let's say two weeks of

422
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,360
course just to learn these here and

423
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,059
malte go malte go

424
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:52,289
in this case you see I made the

425
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:55,710
query based on then I keep then

426
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,030
while seal uses the search engines

427
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:03,780
up to three uses we have indicated

428
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,590
here above

429
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,600
you see how much google bing uses and

430
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,820
this other one here exalead and

431
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:17,880
through queries therefore the search on the

432
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,809
south on the sites is valid instead malte go maintain

433
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:28,159
malte go also uses searches on dns

434
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,940
uses very complex searches on the

435
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,880
targets that we give we can point to

436
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,890
a person could show us the

437
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,740
emails where comp  this person

438
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,280
I did it on the common

439
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,130
domain.venezia.it doing only 23

440
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,169
phone number searches he

441
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:50,669
found me all the phone numbers that I

442
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:52,289
raise the municipality of venice on the

443
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:54,510
common domain of venice however he managed to

444
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,490
recover but not only

445
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,860
then I asked  the email came

446
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,179
to me so I already know that the municipality of

447
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,310
venice at urp municipality of venice inquires

448
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,520
handy cup municipality of venice

449
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,480
to educators etc. and the intranet or

450
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,820
the intranet exploded and showed me

451
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,670
the machines with their public ip  what they

452
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,890
have then let's say that this is

453
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,900
nothing compared to what matthew can

454
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,350
do

455
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:26,640
you know very well everyone with a

456
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,590
simple lewis on a domain

457
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,650
I know the name and surname of the person who

458
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,230
registered it I know where he lives and only

459
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,290
the organization he  head and I know that

460
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:43,580
you are a registrant there are

461
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,090
recently some services that when

462
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,680
you go to register the domain allow you

463
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,290
to hide certain information but only

464
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,560
for some types of domain some

465
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,390
tools but here  and you will

466
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,270
surely know more than me domain tools does it

467
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,800
a bit but there are

468
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,010
many that make you know how to say

469
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,300
both make you and luiz

470
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:12,060
but you also know the dns lookup they make you the

471
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,310
translations from one side to the other and

472
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,260
then retrieve all the information

473
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:23,820
you need for the osint neon airplane that

474
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,990
takes off for mouse int the

475
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,880
wayback machine is fundamental those who know it

476
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,390
these to this is very powerful that is

477
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,250
very useful because because someone puts

478
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,050
an information then deletes it

479
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,090
after a distance of days maybe

480
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,710
I delete it  I can go and see if

481
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,560
going back that web machine the

482
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,690
site as it was on that date in which

483
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,450
I presume he put it had published the

484
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,000
thing and I find myself exactly as the

485
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,450
site was a little while ago obviously serves

486
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,400
precisely to retrieve information from

487
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,500
sites  or pieces of them lost or

488
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,230
deleted after publication I

489
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,050
made the wayback machine on the site in

490
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:14,520
summer camp and we have the first image

491
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,870
that already had

492
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,440
better  the first archive that had wayback

493
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,330
machine was that of 2006 where among

494
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,650
other things the facts we discovered

495
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,690
were doing it in san donà di piave not here,

496
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,100
however, so it seems those who are so old from the

497
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,260
sun of the end summer camp that can

498
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,750
confirm this thing, oh well anyway  the

499
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,910
site speaks for itself so it was was

500
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,190
and they did it definitely okay

501
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,080
here you see simply we went to

502
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:50,490
see how their site in 2006 here we

503
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,220
break through an open door that is logint

504
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,670
now lives on social networks lives

505
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,920
on facebook in an incredible way lives

506
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,740
of twitter of linkedin of everything but also

507
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,620
all the others of the google category

508
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,620


509
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,350
there is a beautiful song the text

510
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,990
is beautiful I like that of j ax and fedez

511
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,740
that says I would like but not post and says a

512
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,230
sentence that took me by surprise c  'is

513
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,790
that he never really liked me that

514
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,500
says how the children will take us

515
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,000
seriously with the evidence that over the years

516
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,309
we have left on facebook dad who

517
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:31,830
every weekend was drunk lost and the

518
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,300
mother who throws  the directors go to every

519
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:33,929
concert

520
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:39,090
these are the words of the test and

521
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,010
this and that is this and that minimum that

522
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:46,110
worries me is minimal but we will see we will see

523
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,320
I will show you that you can find everything on

524
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,980
facebook so it is not the bra the

525
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,860
problem is having  sharing that is the fact

526
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,820
of sharing more than you

527
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,760
really should share and

528
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,740
why this often happens due to lack

529
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,780
of awareness of the risks often by

530
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,980
mistake often out of anger hatred

531
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,420
that is, they subscribe to those things now

532
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,510
praise online is incredible and what and

533
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,750
where are the portals more let's say  which

534
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,730
are the queen of social networks because

535
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,520
after that there is the network of contacts that

536
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,629
propagates the information

537
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,580
not nowadays, as I was saying,

538
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,680
the analysis of the data contained in social

539
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,050
networks is an invaluable source for

540
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,520
intelligence activity  on the web

541
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,500
personal data subjects date of birth

542
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,300
how many people put their date of

543
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,460
birth on facebook then I'll explain what

544
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,450
happens and leave it to me to put it

545
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,340
belonging to groups  the associations

546
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,930
left therefore we started at

547
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,580
noon and a half true it is therefore

548
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:02,990
up to 1 roja until one and a half

549
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,950
today they wrote you however well

550
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,770
limit we interrupt with us or for an hour

551
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,300
as the duration of the talk in theory is

552
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:16,370
the orientation  and religious sexual

553
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,530
show from another very powerful tool

554
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:24,020
that serves and that very useful to make

555
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,200
osint a very recent case for example

556
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,850
was that of a mother who was

557
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,310
alarmed after the article came out

558
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,280
that saw on the internet the photo of the

559
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,460
bedroom where they sleep  his two girls

560
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,350
but necessarily he had put the

561
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,570
surveillance cameras in it not the

562
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,210
control ones that probably who knows how it

563
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,160
was configured and on the routers and

564
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,750
consequently someone had managed to

565
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,600
steal the images inside

566
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,450
this woman's house shodan ago this shodan

567
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,150
allows you to  identify any

568
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:00,020
device connected to the network

569
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,780
and it is obvious that the worse configured they are

570
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,850
firmer does not find shodan finds

571
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:12,690
smart TVs only dan finds  beru terne

572
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,660
too rude and consequently if one

573
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,330
even the key I know of the

574
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:22,440
vulnerability of a router finds how many

575
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,200
there are in the internet to be able to

576
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,850
try to attack for example

577
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,640
frequent positions this also one

578
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,770
thing you love me love has only

579
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,720
surprised me  because then the institutions of the

580
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,630
phones of the manufacturers of the mobile phones

581
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:43,980
is not that they warn the iphone no the iphone

582
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,230
discovered that it has a beautiful option

583
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,750
inside the privacy settings

584
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,330
which is frequent position

585
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,110
the android co that happens the same thing

586
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,490
now sure they do not know the  it goes to

587
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,910
disable but maybe when one

588
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,770
knows it is better to do it because if then the

589
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,690
phone finds it to someone else heaven

590
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,580
takes a second that I go to the bathroom if

591
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,310
the colleague takes it takes it

592
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,720
love but the wife

593
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,870
suppose and these things can that

594
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,820
can  be born really unpleasant

595
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,010
misunderstandings because unpleasant inconveniences

596
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:23,460
rather than misunderstandings record everything I have

597
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,860
been more often and more frequently in

598
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:31,669
that place when I co  n what duration

599
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,030
thanks okay so here I

600
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,220
suggest for those who do not know about this

601
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,230
thing to check their phone is there

602
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,090
active or not the standard payroll function is

603
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:46,350
born with the function active

604
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,270
so you have to remove it it is convenient

605
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,260
in short web page and cookies inevitable to

606
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,940
say  that even the cookies

607
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,370
in any case track no

608
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:00,000
profiling ones track the laws, customs and

609
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,390
habits of all the users

610
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:07,590
who visit the pages it is okay the cookies

611
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,840
venice high the log files will be the

612
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,110
same because also the log files nene

613
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,150
that  there are on the internet and they record

614
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,520
our passage they record the pages

615
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,380
we have seen they record everything but

616
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,120
many activities that fall with you

617
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,610
in the private sphere of the people

618
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,679
there was an alarm from the

619
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,950
British privacy supervisor who discovered that

620
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,610
there is a technology that  allows you to

621
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,140
track the movements of the smartphone

622
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,850
using the mac address of the device

623
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:48,690
precisely that this thing happened in the

624
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,900
shops have this  technology that

625
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,990
caught the mac addresses of the devices

626
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,880
saw where they were going and what they

627
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,309
buy most often and mom

628
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:01,530
could not then identify who

629
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,179
were the

630
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:06,000
great people British privacy put

631
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,980
a brake on it because it's not that if I go to the

632
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,980
store, minimum I catch if obviously where

633
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,750
turn on they catch me the mac address and

634
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,390
then trace me which compartment I go to

635
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,640
or what I do

636
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,790
and yet it happened I usually on the

637
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,320
background of his articles I always put the

638
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,549
link then as if you want to go and

639
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:28,549
see you a beautiful article

640
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:31,500
that  did that carola frediani wrote in the press

641
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,670


642
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,800
a very very good journalist and he is

643
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,480
arrested so your smartphone knows

644
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,240
everything about you about your future

645
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,900
he made an infographic where he

646
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,300
showed that I think at 10 o'clock sending

647
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,640
emails are obviously recorded

648
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,550
emails somewhere the

649
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:58,290
provider knows at 12 30 phone

650
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,730
the operator with evening keeps

651
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,590
sender recipient type of call for two years

652
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,960
iamato the date duration the date the

653
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,770
duration then other data at 16 I

654
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,000
connect to the internet of my operator

655
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,920
keeps for a year when I connect

656
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,710
and from where I go on the e-commerce site

657
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,630
at 16 35 I am tracked by 15 other

658
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,700
companies the same when I go to the site  of the

659
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,670
weather dozens and dozens of the three that also

660
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,170
for media and media sites

661
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:29,710
so everywhere now with those on

662
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,520
smartphones

663
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,210
whatever we do there is the risk

664
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,100
is often the sum of being tracked

665
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,990
then it is obvious that they draw tracks by the

666
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,850
provider we see tracked by the site  e

667
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:40,330
commerce

668
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,300
but we are tracked and this the

669
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,010
governments know I recommend a beautiful

670
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,090
documentary that won the

671
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,100
oscar award in 2015 that the one that talks

672
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,970
about the history of modems with

673
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,240
nsa glue because it is very very nice on these

674
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,010
topics here in fact after the

675
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,340
detections detections that would then be

676
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,860
the revelations of the spying

677
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,810
of the intelligence agency and those

678
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,240
of the hecking team scandal on the

679
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,930
industry  private individual who checks

680
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,790
online the sensitivity as a municipality

681
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,940
towards the problem, however, it has increased

682
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,900
this is true there is no need to say it

683
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,330
of the researchers of the network security group of the

684
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,000
iti erice of the

685
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,930
federal polytechnic of zurich and giorgio danesi

686
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,460
stand of the university  London colleges

687
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,780
believe that it is the very infrastructure

688
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,760
of the network as conceived,

689
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,980
after all, it was born without thinking about the

690
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,830
problem of privacy or the data that

691
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,720
came in short

692
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,270
from user profiling

693
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,730
and it is precisely the network that is inclined

694
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,010
to surveillance

695
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,020
they then made an essay  in which they

696
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,180
present provide the new

697
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,740
anonymity system that will take the place of thor

698
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,320
and that should solve this

699
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,070
problem

700
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,210
the new idea is to have the

701
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,560
protection of privacy as an

702
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,930
integral aspect of the internet itself

703
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,240
now do not ask me how but this

704
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,120
would be the  idea in on earth and in hornet

705
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,179
the idea that internet providers can

706
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,739
integrate this service into their

707
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,418
infrastruct  ura digital offering a

708
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,449
more widespread privacy protection

709
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:19,620
will surely have to pass a long time

710
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,210
before ordet can take the place

711
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,320
of tower even if hornet has already collected

712
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,418
the interest of giants such as google

713
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,940
swisscom together with governments of switzerland

714
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:36,810
india seems to be panama fame for you have

715
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,909
known everything  what has

716
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:43,500
happened so far so far we have seen an

717
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,880
aspect that is related to

718
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,780
technology what is happening

719
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,199
nowadays is that many an aspect

720
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,360
that was not connected to technology before

721
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,830
is entering the network powerfully

722
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,520
and therefore increases the risks for  who

723
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,990
wants to know the facts of others,

724
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:10,590
now I will explain why, for example, with

725
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,970
the digitization of all documents

726
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,690
in the public archives, obviously

727
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,080
paying what is needed but archives

728
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,560
such as the land registry and online

729
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,600
if I register I can go and see

730
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,670
and know the name and a  surname of a person

731
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,740
and maybe the duty of which municipality he lives

732
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,200
I can see that real estate to all

733
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,060
properties  who has simply

734
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,300
sitting at my house

735
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,600
ditto for corporate information

736
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,890
once you had to go to the chamber of

737
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,620
commerce now with cerved 1 well you

738
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,310
subscribe or pay for the single service and can

739
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,680
know how many members a company

740
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,330
has made what turnover it is

741
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,420
budget

742
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,100
etc. etc. excels its offices and

743
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,810
therefore a lot of information

744
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,490
prejudicial protests other there are

745
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,900
specific sites mostly behind there is

746
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,810
a detective agency that has one that

747
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,880
has bought services from the bodies in

748
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,000
charge but by paying for the service you

749
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,470
can know if  a person is

750
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:17,600
protested gets a certificate of incorporation and

751
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,390
this was once done by going to

752
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,790
individual offices but not only in the municipality

753
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,610
where the person resided now you can

754
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:35,070
simply do it from home important point

755
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,020


756
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,880
you know that if I want I know the

757
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,380
name, surname and at least  in short, at a date of

758
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,980
birth of a person the area in and of the

759
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,810
municipality where he lives

760
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,490
I can get to have a family status as

761
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,940
well as a residency  to

762
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,050
freely without problems I will pay the

763
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,380
stamps I will pay a few

764
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,869
small pennies and I can do it because they are

765
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:03,930
public archives lana the registry office and the

766
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,760
marital status are public archives

767
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,700
once to do this you had to

768
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,230
go to the municipality for which the person

769
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,260
resided so many sites now a lot  never

770
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,670
again that so many municipalities are

771
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,740
putting online this thing for which

772
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,260
milan for example if you are not from

773
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,920
milan whoever you are you register but

774
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,080
you can do the family status or the

775
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,990
state of residence of someone who lives in

776
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,280
milan

777
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,230
what you need  obviously for this reason I was

778
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,730
saying first attention to what is

779
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,930
published and above all the data that is

780
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,150
used to identify a person if

781
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,650
I have my name and surname on

782
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,970
facebook but I put the date of birth

783
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,119
and where I live is enough to be able to

784
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,460
ask for one  family status in a

785
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,940
municipality ok and with a family status I

786
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,040
find out where you live because there is

787
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,920
also the residence together but also those who

788
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,310
live with you so this is the ge  nte does

789
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,130
not understand it and quietly in the wind

790
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,210
so they give me birthday wishes

791
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,550
yes ok but they also give you other wishes if

792
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,050
they wanted to come to your house

793
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:10,610
and do what they want

794
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,890
you see that in fact the

795
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,870
registry certificates, extracts and certificates of

796
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,760
state make family can  be

797
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,010
requested by anyone even if even if they are

798
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,440
registered in the name of other people they are

799
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,850
issued at all the

800
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,400
registry offices or through the

801
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,270
home delivery service the site of the municipality

802
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,210
of Milan which is increasingly

803
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,120
the municipalities will go in this direction

804
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,070
because they are useful services for

805
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,690
citizens  and also because in any case

806
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,570
they have the obligation to digitize the

807
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:47,100
documents another thing

808
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,070
the aci on the aci site but you know but if

809
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,660
I see a plate on the street I go to the

810
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,570
aci site I pay 8 euros but I see

811
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,940
whose car it is I see the name  and surname where he

812
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,560
lives

813
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,140
and this also while once you

814
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,490
have to go to the public

815
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,190
car register obtained from the top on

816
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,730
site then in z  ona and then usually one

817
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,500
did not do it now if one teases me

818
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,480
with the car and you want to go

819
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,460
to the cia site if you have the license plate

820
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,530
you can find out who the car is and

821
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:23,990
where this lives there is no license plate but

822
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,120
this is not  the

823
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,100
human factor has something to do with it and we

824
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,940
are about to close so far so

825
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,860
we have seen the

826
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,000
techniques with which we can get to

827
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,740
obtain information from people and

828
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,890
companies,

829
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,050
let's see why we can go

830
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,300
beyond public archives which, being

831
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,960
such, must necessarily  do it for which

832
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,600
they still have to put on the network

833
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,910
what is information that concerns us

834
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,030
unfortunately, however, they are only

835
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,700
public bodies so alas, let

836
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,260
's not hurt ourselves by going to

837
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,410
put other data on maybe on social media

838
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:11,190
on our site etc. and no

839
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,450
the amount of information

840
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,890
we publish on social media is enormous, however on the

841
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:17,610
internet it is not to be considered what we

842
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,530
spread that we put today but what

843
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,670
we  we have put

844
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,890
names on facebook since today to make a

845
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:25,049
profile of a person you do not look at the

846
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:27,569
post he has put today and you just go and

847
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:29,490
scroll through the bulletin board you go all the way

848
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,440
and you can know who are the friends

849
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,079
what he wrote  where he was on

850
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,250
vacation and all the other things very strong

851
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,750
those who write I go on vacation one

852
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,020
month how nice I go to hawaii go later come

853
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,210
back to us it will be a house burgled between

854
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:51,059
strange extras if the thieves thank and

855
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:53,430
date of birth photo of the view of the

856
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,730
terrace with the  geolocation that has

857
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,290
published the enthusiasm the photo of the

858
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,059
license just taken in the

859
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:01,290
meantime on the license a there is written

860
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:04,619
nothing true no to those who want to

861
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,420
harm us who wants to steal us in case he wants to

862
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,040
trace our complete profile to

863
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,569
implement social engineering because

864
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:12,119
then between intention  with the information

865
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,339
that you understand for example from facebook

866
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,250
or tweets from any social network or from a

867
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,500
site you can implement what social

868
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,720
engineering for which I post ch  and i know

869
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:27,329
that you like to go on vacation to

870
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:27,720
hawaii i

871
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,200
pretend to be a

872
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,270
travel agency i call you about what you have or a

873
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,579
promotional package simo to go

874
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:38,700
to hawaii you for your passion

875
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,950
maybe you fall for it but this is nothing

876
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,230
the agencies of  intelligence this

877
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:52,170
the detective agencies do this the

878
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,339
police

879
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:55,230
do this they do hand a lot more they can do

880
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:00,059
still very widespread and the

881
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,849
underlying problems are we human beings we

882
00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:05,849
forget the internet no once

883
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:07,920
we put stuff on the internet it

884
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,250
remains for us then it comes out that  which is the

885
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,710
big problem of the right to be forgotten

886
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,510
because if I have been

887
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:19,349
condemned ten years ago if you go

888
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:21,359
look today my name still appears

889
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,740
because maybe there is the article

890
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,400
there I would have the right in theory no to

891
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,970
tacchio and then  10 years are gone I

892
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:33,150
got out enough must people

893
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,230
still have to know maybe

894
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,880
it happened and then maybe get an idea

895
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,720
that is no longer what is me now

896
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,560
no

897
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,090
so this is a gr  osso problem

898
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,400
attention because in fact

899
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,250
publishing is quick but then in ten years as

900
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:51,750
the song from our children's song says

901
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,820
one tomorrow that is they will discover that

902
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,530
maybe the parents went drunk

903
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:59,549
every Friday or that they danced

904
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:02,319
on the cube that chienes I understood so

905
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,029
this is the problem  it is also because

906
00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:08,469
even the best technology can fall

907
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:10,539
under behavior in a t manner

908
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:12,130
but not only the technology itself

909
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,130
can be vulnerable if in addition but the

910
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,229
configured means that what in

911
00:43:17,229 --> 00:43:20,589
theory should remain safe is no

912
00:43:20,589 --> 00:43:22,900
longer so because it is published  maybe on the

913
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,319
internet I will

914
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,369
conclude by showing you if this is

915
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:31,869
very strong they have created a

916
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:35,940
facebook page called photo license mozzecane

917
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,660
mozzecane is a municipality of verona

918
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,489
if they are clever to say come on we put them

919
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:44,680
all the photo of our license now

920
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,789
someone was smart and

921
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:51,819
maybe just put the  photos and some data

922
00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:53,979
come so you can see that I know

923
00:43:53,979 --> 00:43:56,559
in the Mozzecane residence via Maria

924
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:57,910
Ausiliatrice

925
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:02,709
I know  the name surname because it is ok name and

926
00:44:02,709 --> 00:44:05,229
surname here is the city is here there is the

927
00:44:05,229 --> 00:44:07,029
street already or some

928
00:44:07,029 --> 00:44:10,749
interesting information this has been overcome a

929
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:13,420
little more because he has also put the dates of

930
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,299
the date of birth is heck and sorry  and

931
00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:19,150
I know that she is from Mozzecane I know where she lives and

932
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,949
that you also have the date of birth or

933
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:23,829
if I go to the registry office of ascom I have everything

934
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:28,119
of her and this is the best of

935
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:30,880
all because she put everything for which name

936
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,089
place of birth city  residence the

937
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:36,160
signature also the signature if I wanted to make a

938
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,059
document in his name

939
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:42,759
I can also copy the signature ok the

940
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:44,680
license number and issued by whoever

941
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,339
ita here this is this is nothing of

942
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:51,999
what you actually see today on the

943
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:54,479
internet

944
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:56,920
I put the two links  of where I took two

945
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,469
photos that I showed you that so to be

946
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:03,130
fair and I ended up in the space

947
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:05,940
I hope I have not bored

948
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:19,850
you if you have any questions good morning

949
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,150
thanks in fact a couple of questions

950
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:25,940
let's see since you have criticized some

951
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:26,990
public records

952
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,940
no it's not that the  or critic  ate that

953
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,640
burns me a positive result that is the sites but

954
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,070
they have certain mechanism it was very

955
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,600
correct you never said it is wrong

956
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,220
added that it was limited to saying I

957
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,500
don't like any more yesterday I had to go around

958
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,030
the seven churches

959
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,500
today the problem could be maximum

960
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,440
in the sense that if I download 56

961
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,330
million records and do an analysis I do

962
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,210
something that yesterday I could not exact

963
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,530
said this the fact that those registers

964
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,690
are public to some

965
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,820
ancient reasons and that they are at the base of the wall

966
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,780
ceases very important you did not talk

967
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,570
about  su brianza i.e. the idea that

968
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:05,060
if privacy is completely pink

969
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,550
the real point is the information symmetry

970
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,620
someone knows something about me I don't know who

971
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,300
knows something about me someone a little

972
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,310
aggregate a lot of data I don't

973
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:16,940
control my data there are some  social

974
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,620
networks that play the type if you want to

975
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,180
see that he has seen your profile

976
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,700
when you go to the team they see that

977
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,230
you have gone if you want to remain anonymous you do not

978
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:26,060
see that you see the second t  and it could

979
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,570
be a procedure as to say to be

980
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,310
implemented also at the level of

981
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:32,690
public administrations I give you

982
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,070
all the public data you want

983
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:37,250
but the data are of the person

984
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,990
I am talking about that person has the

985
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,640
right to know that you have

986
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,140
looked at him according to and this  it can be a

987
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,810
process to be put in place.

988
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:48,320


989
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,910


990
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,010


991
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,960


992
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,430


993
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:58,370


994
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,380
even physically in the registry office

995
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:05,750
this happens so there is yes the problem is

996
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:08,810
this I do not think that even we remove the

997
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,430
internet

998
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,740
I do not think that every family status that

999
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,510
one goes to make of one of a

1000
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:18,140
common person they advise they do not do it because it

1001
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,790
is prudent they are

1002
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,340
not required not  I don't know I have never

1003
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,200
informed myself of this they do it for the

1004
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,730
prudent transparency that is said because

1005
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:28,580
one day, one day if it comes out  i

1006
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,630
something can be traced back but I have

1007
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,910
never heard of anyone who

1008
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:36,320
actually went to tell who

1009
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,660
asked and I am not even if they give it to you

1010
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,520
who asked for information about me I

1011
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,660
do not know if they give it to you probably it is for

1012
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,030
how it is made  but probably the network

1013
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,580
now I think it is difficult that for

1014
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,010
example if I download no I can

1015
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:54,620
get there bye better perhaps from the

1016
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,570
same institution from which I download yes future there

1017
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:58,250
could be an idea that I know I

1018
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,010
ask the municipality for the family status the

1019
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,660
status  of a family that to whom the eyes of those

1020
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,130
of that person who sends them

1021
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:08,720
an email look should understand the

1022
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,940
rationale of why these registers are

1023
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:14,090
public and why we should

1024
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:16,430
really understand but it would perhaps be

1025
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:18,020
even easier with technology now

1026
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:24,490
certainly yes but even if  a

1027
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,570
chance to implement this thing

1028
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,570
here when I

1029
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,720
fraudulently register a stolen cat and charity

1030
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,530
or things like that by specifying my identity

1031
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:38,420
we are formed s  ignor mario rossi

1032
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,760
that someone was true is the result of the

1033
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,510
family in fact it is not that we can

1034
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,520
then trace who actually was

1035
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,490
in my opinion certainly it is that we enter them,

1036
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,650
however, in a perspective that then you know and

1037
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:54,290
of crime for which crime is

1038
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,480
always a step forward

1039
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,220
fundamentally so what I think about here he was saying to me

1040
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:04,070
name alberto was something that was

1041
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:07,180
alien to the fact

1042
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,580
of crime that is normally it

1043
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,230
could be done because because it could

1044
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:14,360
be my right to know that you have

1045
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,530
asked for my family status

1046
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,290
however it comes to mind that this is not even

1047
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:21,260
said because on ponies whoever

1048
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,580
does investigations that must remain

1049
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,530
hidden to also suppose an activity that

1050
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,870
is a private investigator

1051
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,450
probably must, that is, the municipality must know

1052
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:33,349
that maybe

1053
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:34,729
I did it for the forces of the  I order

1054
00:49:34,729 --> 00:49:37,069
the judicial authority but not to tell

1055
00:49:37,069 --> 00:49:39,710
the person from whom I asked maybe

1056
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,299
this is the right key to reading

1057
00:49:41,299 --> 00:49:44,329
because they must be guarantors  ti

1058
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:47,140
those subjects who make the assessments

1059
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,910
protected by the law understood then

1060
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,799
then after that it would be

1061
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:54,619
difficult to distinguish who does it who

1062
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:59,559
does not that is one more step

1063
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:02,059
no no no money in fact it is true

1064
00:50:02,059 --> 00:50:03,339
it would be necessary to implement

1065
00:50:03,339 --> 00:50:05,569
china I just said it is  a little more complex

1066
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:08,059
still because then I would have to

1067
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:09,680
tell you this yes but I have to prove

1068
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,579
it to you so then I should also give you the

1069
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:15,170
document that I am an investigator

1070
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,640
no his are waiting only because

1071
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,859
the investigator can do nothing except

1072
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:23,390
on behalf of someone not  it

1073
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:28,940
's half

1074
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,799
past one they're not hungry very quick question you talked about the

1075
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:33,920
hornet project is that there are already some big names

1076
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,470
who are interested in supporting it

1077
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:40,219
but their intention to collect data goes a little bit

1078
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:41,690


1079
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:42,769
to the turkey to

1080
00:50:42,769 --> 00:50:44,079
anticipate Thanksgiving

1081
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,150
what is the point then that the big names take an

1082
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,950
interest in a project that lives

1083
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,749
would invite themselves to

1084
00:50:50,749 --> 00:50:52,579
collect  data about us because

1085
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:54,589
they have to do they have to make a nice face

1086
00:50:54,589 --> 00:50:56,450
and then purely they won't

1087
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,239
and this maybe the chariots do because they

1088
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:01,670
can't say no no no I didn't understand they

1089
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:04,130
have to say yes beautiful beautiful

1090
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,559
we settle down with that

1091
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,569
public opinion then a lot  basically we do it

1092
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:10,819
but the rest of the nsa the American government went

1093
00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:13,640
ahead for a lifetime to say

1094
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,950
that it is not true that it did what

1095
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:19,779
modena said so this is the problem

1096
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,990
is a multinational may be

1097
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:25,810
interested that the user can

1098
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:27,880
only be traced by them  using their

1099
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:33,900
services and not from others it is certain in fact

1100
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,020
another

1101
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,430
hello while even then if the last

1102
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:42,760
question

1103
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,100
ok the last question guys sorry

1104
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,300
time is running out

1105
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,060
sauces there are techniques similar

1106
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:54,010
to google docs for the dark we are

1107
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,070
a very special topic

1108
00:51:57,070 --> 00:52:00,220
in my opinion  yes but it already exists

1109
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:07,270
here I had read an abstract or an

1110
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:10,480
article published recently that

1111
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,070
some researchers have made this

1112
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,480
bar system  shield earning to

1113
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,020
find zero day on the web in dar I look

1114
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,300
then something is maybe not as

1115
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,380
public as google

1116
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,660
google searches but there is something there

1117
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,380
communications in service

1118
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,900
you have to run if you want to have lunch at

1119
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,970
login to get poker
