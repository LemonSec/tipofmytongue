1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,899
good evening everyone thanks my first

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:10,679
experience i go out and i am very happy my

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,389
name is mattia epifani i deal with

4
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,870
digital forensics i am not as i said

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,430
in the club before i am not a cop i

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,949
am a passionate computer nerd

7
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:29,070
i do not feel too much i have to

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,070
turn down not me  despite this I

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,579
am very happy to be here they

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,820
asked me for a talk that could be of

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,239
interest and I chose a theme that I have

12
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,399
developed enough in recent years

13
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:53,969
trying to reverse my head that is

14
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,940
I usually try to enter

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,989
iPhones to bring out the  data and then

16
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,030
I tried to reverse the reasoning and

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,670
try to give you a series of ideas and

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,290
guidelines on how to prevent me from

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,540
rebus and other people

20
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,810
involved in this sector from entering

21
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,000
inside iphone top iphone

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,560
because the  platform that I know best

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,880
and therefore I think it can be an

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,520
interesting topic if someone has

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,610
followed our lab today is a few

26
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,250
people fac  that is, tabula rasa then

27
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,979
we start again as if for those who

28
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,020
have not followed the lab they are

29
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,380
visibly drunk I would also like that

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,210
compared to 5 today and so this

31
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,630
is turning on the brain but we get there

32
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,899


33
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,130
no I was saying that I am visibly

34
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:09,929
drunk so you can hardly see  this is

35
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,260
the

36
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,310
quiet problem so the first instruction the

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,549
first rule is that if you have an iphone 4

38
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:23,910
or a phone prior to the iphone 4

39
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,769
you can also throw it in the garbage or

40
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:33,269
use it to do things that are not

41
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,440
your life we have the minister

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,660
migrate that we have a  tesla coil

43
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,640
which really likes iphones

44
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,540
ok attracts them like a magnet well well

45
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,000
because you have to change it immediately because

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,670
there are two problems the first the first

47
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,410
a vulnerability on the boot process

48
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,680
unthinkable unless you recall all

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,109
the devices in the house by  apple

50
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:04,109
choice that would be a bit expensive

51
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:06,750
this basically allows you to

52
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,859
boot with an alternative operating system let's

53
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:09,269


54
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,230
say  or so and this alternative operating system

55
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,200
can bruteforce the

56
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,970
passcode without invoking the limits imposed

57
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,010
by the ios operating system i.e. the

58
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,380
maximum number of attempts imposed by the

59
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,099
ios operating system plus the latest

60
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,400
supported version and ios 712 i.e. the latest

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,760
version of ios 7  that the problem of

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,549
a grasse 7 that apple lied a bit

63
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,120
when it migrated from us 7 ensuring

64
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,519
the encryption of all data this

65
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,769
is not true in the sense that

66
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,760
most of the information on s7 is not

67
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,709
encrypted on the basis of your passcode

68
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,609
but are  encrypted solely by

69
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,230
the internal mechanisms

70
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,269
of the operating system that each reset

71
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:05,580
generates new keys and digits every

72
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,260
single file with a distinct key

73
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,730
now I do not want to go into this

74
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,849
technical detail but the

75
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,500
fundamental problem is that if I access the

76
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,590
machine, that is, if I can

77
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,459
interrupt the boot process and

78
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,449
load an alternative operating system

79
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:21,540
as the data is not

80
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,060
encrypted according to ours  post cod

81
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,729
I just ask through this

82
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:27,750
operating system for

83
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,500
the keys and I will decrypt the data if not in a

84
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,889
way that depends on the passcode then the

85
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:40,620
sms contacts the photos the videos are

86
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,380
not encrypted in any way you can put

87
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,990
an 80-digit code and we will take out data

88
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,699
without need  to know your

89
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,570
code

90
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,860
third-party applications remain encrypted

91
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,160
so if you have an iphone 4 with whatsapp

92
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,740
is installed the whatsapp database is

93
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,350
encrypted in a way that also depends on

94
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,849
your passcode said this if you have a

95
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,979
passcode that is too simple

96
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,010
the cracking times are anyway  rapid

97
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,830
in the sense that we have shown a four-digit code

98
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,930
today we have

99
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,630
violated it on average in 20 minutes perhaps today

100
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,789
it took a little longer but if there

101
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:25,919
are not twenty it is 30

102
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,250
a six-digit code is 35

103
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,370
euros to 17  it breaks in two weeks

104
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,930
clear that increasing the combinations

105
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,400
increases the time needed so

106
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,470
iphone 4 take and throw away

107
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,970
if you have an iphone 4s 55 c maybe

108
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,849
the time is coming to throw it away

109
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:54,740
in the sense that for all devices

110
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,690
with 32 bit processor i.e. up to the

111
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,729
iphone 5 c included it is sel bright or

112
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,520
better especially if the bright

113
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,990
Israeli company that was also let's say

114
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,150
named when there was the

115
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,650
apple has been a question of unlocking the

116
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,680
san bernardino phone

117
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,390
if the bright is a proprietary solution that is

118
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:23,690
not widespread and cannot be

119
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,370
purchased through software but

120
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,250
only through a

121
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,000
32-bit device unlocking service until this

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,370
slide get to itself 932 online and 934 not

123
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,159
there is still the ix35 but I think it is not

124
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:44,550
what the update

125
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,560
of apple is not imagining that can change this

126
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,860
thing substantially since the iphone

127
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,090
4s will not be upgradeable to dario s10 by

128
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,940
choice of apple an iphone 4s will fall

129
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,039
into the same  problem of the iphone 4

130
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,310
the only difference is that an iphone 4

131
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,889
we produce it to violate without the need to

132
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:08,159
ask for support from sel bright for now

133
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:11,159
for the 4s we have to take advantage of this  or

134
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:15,210
service, however, there are also devices

135
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:19,039
of this type that up to ios and 8

136
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,190
allow you to bruteforce the

137
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,190
passcode by passing the code through

138
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,919
the usb port, i.e. basically

139
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,039
we do not enter the code via the

140
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,409
touch screen

141
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:37,830
because the touchscreen is able to start

142
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,990
let's put it like this  the protection systems

143
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,229
that he inserted to avoid a

144
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,960
brute force attack and then specifically

145
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,630
after five attempts the

146
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,669
isabella screen appears the iphone is

147
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:52,260
disabled wait five minutes

148
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,270
after five minutes you can enter

149
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,669
another five codes and so on

150
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,530
this thing worked  works

151
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,660
with ios 7 forward it was a

152
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,300
protection system that apple has inserted but

153
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,040
inserted it only if the insertion is done

154
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,570
via touch screen

155
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,930
the usb port of the iphone is able to

156
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,710
receive codes i can pass the code

157
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,680
via usb and not  inserting it via the

158
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,310
touch screen

159
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:30,250
now I have brought this is the

160
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,559
phone we used today the one

161
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,039
in which we have  I did the test of the code

162
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,380
I changed the code because you remember

163
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,430
that it was 8,492 and it

164
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,060
would have taken a little too long I

165
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,100
set the code to 00 15 00 15 this

166
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,220
box basically what it does

167
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,660
I attach it to the usb port

168
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,450
I do it  turn on and start

169
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,740
passing the codes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0

170
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,600
2 or I can decide to

171
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,180
reprogram it by having it apply the

172
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,570
codes in the sequence I prefer

173
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:23,850
when it finds the code yes

174
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,010
visibly drunk asks me well

175
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,450
so calm or in hand

176
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,690
situation begins to pass the codes

177
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,839
to the device going either

178
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,870
sequentially or according to the rule

179
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,550
that we establish for it through a

180
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,770
software obviously with which we

181
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:50,110
interface this object what

182
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,110
happens if I try to do it from the

183
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,800
touchscreen

184
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,140
after the first five codes are  blocked

185
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,120
he can go on

186
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,390
that is he goes on thanks

187
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,540
start passing him code 6 code

188
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,700
7 code 8 until he reaches  15

189
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,860
when it arrives at 15 the phone

190
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,699
unlocks

191
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:12,669
even if on the screen I see it has been

192
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:14,369
disabled

193
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:17,910
so the

194
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,290
disabling protection is basically a

195
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,350
sort of let's call it a screensaver or a little

196
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,669
more than a screen 6 but there is one

197
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,939
more thing that this is a  object that is

198
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:33,819
unable to receive an answer back

199
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,919
from the phone and tells him look that I have

200
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,899
been unlocked

201
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,720
i.e. he is unable to stop ok he

202
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,350
goes on

203
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,040
bon bon bon bon has no input he

204
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,509
cannot understand when the code is

205
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:49,119
right then  I did not bring it because

206
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:52,749
too much less zoe to mount it on this door

207
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:54,759
a brightness sensor is basically attached

208
00:10:54,759 --> 00:11:00,100
so that when the

209
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,549
phone is unlocked the brightness

210
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:05,980
on the screen changes the brightness sensor

211
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,639
notices the

212
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:14,199
brightness variation and alerts the box that  the

213
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:16,299
phone has been unlocked the box

214
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,879
receives this input stops and

215
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,579
starts flashing the code to emit a

216
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:25,119
sound you will not see it now in the

217
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,399
sense that I have not brought the sensor

218
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,309
so I start it as always

219
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:31,989
it will not work and because it worked

220
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:36,220
today it is time that she

221
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,149
turns on it says good so it's okay that is apparently it

222
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:47,319
is better than bad I press scan he

223
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:48,730
starts from zero

224
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,519
to  start you see the entry of the

225
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,899
codes on the numeric keypad on the fifth

226
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,799
attempt the phone should go into

227
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,739
a disabled state so

228
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:07,149
basically a

229
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:08,589
black screen should appear with the word iphone

230
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:17,619
disabled next ok you see I don't know

231
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:17,950
if the

232
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,410
theme written iphone is disabled he

233
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:26,140
is going on the code 00  15 00 15

234
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,690
the phone unlocks

235
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,850
despite the fact that it says iphone is

236
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:37,450
disabled it's very nice

237
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,420
unfortunately it only works up to ios 7 and

238
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,580
with some tricks even with

239
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,480
help 8 now we get to the end and

240
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,640
talk about how apple has fixed

241
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,620
this problem because it took it  cure

242
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,590
let's say on a diet but it doesn't work it's

243
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,670
a bad vulnerability definitely

244
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,810
maybe it's better that we think about it

245
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,230
and maybe they thought about it not very well

246
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:13,630
the first time they thought about it and

247
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,840
you see this is the beauty of the

248
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:24,310
live test and it is not going or it has not taken

249
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:29,550
the code or it is not 0 0 15

250
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,720
yes today it worked who was there

251
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,310
today he saw it up to ios s7 it basically works

252
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:48,460
what has changed in

253
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,380
are you s8 is paul said ok it is useful to

254
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,930
keep the possibility of passing

255
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,750
codes via usb

256
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,380
I don't know why so we don't block

257
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,250
this possibility but let's

258
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,330
allow a maximum of  five

259
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,000
attempts via usb

260
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,910
then we no longer accept codes but

261
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,940
this counter is not

262
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,960
stored anywhere so I turn off

263
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,650
the phone again and I can continue

264
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,650
so the creator of this object

265
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,790
has always added

266
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,350
eto'o that it goes that must be

267
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,130
connected to the phone directly on the

268
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,200
battery that is by opening the phone and

269
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,150
sticking on the battery which is

270
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,790
basically what you see in this

271
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,480
small image sticking on the

272
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,740
battery this this price  in addition it

273
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,840
manages the turning off of the phone

274
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,050
after four attempts i.e. makes four

275
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,830
attempts turns off the phone waits for

276
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,440
the phone to restart and then tells him to

277
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,750
go on it is very long it is a big

278
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,350
risk that by dint of sending it turns

279
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,930
off turns off turns off turns off almost thirty TVs

280
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,280
phone dies there if the bright can

281
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,280
do this without

282
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,580
opening the phone but using an object

283
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,900
that looks like this

284
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,310
but works for a different eight

285
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,640
different 9 whose properties in

286
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
quotation marks are not

287
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,010
known yet this thing here they leave  do only

288
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,540
them and that's why they have not

289
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,850
integrated it into any software at the moment

290
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,560
but they sell it as a service updated

291
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,290
always trivial always updated the latest

292
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:56,320
version of ios last week if

293
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,770
any of you have read about the first

294
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:08,050
real gauss is devastating malware for  ios

295
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,530
sold at very high costs from what I have read

296
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,820
25,000 dollars a target from

297
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:21,040
what I have read is obviously exploits

298
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,890
a vulnerability of  safari webkit and

299
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,620
through this jailbreaking the

300
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,600
phone totally transparent to the

301
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,360
user in addition it injects libraries

302
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,339
that go to do we say to do hooking

303
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:44,980
on the various applications that is monitors

304
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,339
no viber whatsapp etcetera etcetera and

305
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,050
shoot all the data outside

306
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,120
works on viber  on workshop on

307
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,960
telegram on sms on photos on how much

308
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,440
everything there is on a phone if

309
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,510
you want to download the technical

310
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,349
report there are 24 pages but it is very

311
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:11,520
nice explained very well lookout that is the

312
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,920
apple let's say who made the

313
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,189
disclosure  together with the citizen lab of the

314
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:19,300
vulnerability

315
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,849
because I say updated to the latest

316
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,069
version r us and because theoretically things

317
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,290
of this kind can also be

318
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,230
used for forensics purposes if there is

319
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,760
a vulnerability that allows us to

320
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,370
extract data we extract updated also

321
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,820
because there are so many bugs  of lock screen

322
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,240
that is daily from daily

323
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,170
goes for every version or almost of ios

324
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,780
bu are published  g that

325
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,580
allow you to bypass the screen

326
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,690
some are fake

327
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,050
others but instead work for example

328
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,290
one of the last arrived 9 3 to 1 the

329
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,450
one that through siri and calling up

330
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,760
by searching on twitter click

331
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,740
on the address an email address

332
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,440
present in any tweet

333
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,700
only worked  on devices like

334
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,760
the iphone you know they have 3d so

335
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,780
email that comes in 3d and contact

336
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,030
add photos from add photos see the

337
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,980
images back

338
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,830
see all the address book and so on so in

339
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,230
any case when you do forensics

340
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,270
any information you can

341
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,650
get information  that we would not have

342
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,810
had so it is still useful or

343
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,390
potentially useful

344
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,100
this site in my opinion is the only one that

345
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,660
despite the rl but in reality the

346
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,520
content is updated that keeps track

347
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,730
for each version of ios of the various bugs

348
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,580
that come out obviously set

349
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,050
an access code

350
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,340
my advice is however to use an

351
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,680
access code and it is not four-

352
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,730
digit obviously possibly that it

353
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,560
is not  even at 6

354
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,710
because it is as if the bright has discovered

355
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,290
a technique to do bruteforce on those

356
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,940
devices it is not possible to exclude

357
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,760
at present that in six months or a

358
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,590
year there will be the same thing for an iphone

359
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,460
6 and an iphone or an iphone 6 so  what

360
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,910
will come out from here on

361
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,000
this is simply useful for us

362
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,500
because apple somehow helps us to

363
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,150
understand the complexity of the password

364
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,860
because the screen changes according to

365
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,700
the complexity of the password

366
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,050
obviously also pay attention to the

367
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,580
fingerprints that are comfortable for use

368
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,060
of the phone obviously have

369
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,830
the problem that your finger can

370
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,899
be used to unlock the phone

371
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,500
there are the so-called smith atac to

372
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,580
understand which are the most popular or

373
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,620
most recently pressed areas to understand

374
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,440
possible codes it is most

375
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,380
usually used on swipes of

376
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,790
android devices but  even on iphone can

377
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,490
somehow use two

378
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:23,970
more words about fingerprint in ios s9 the

379
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,520
basic thing ch  and the

380
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,920
fingerprint can be re-entered that is

381
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,320
valid for 48 hours substantially

382
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,110
after which you have to enter

383
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,240
the passcode manually at least once who uses the

384
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,610
phone will realize that every now

385
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,410
and then even if you never turn off if you have an

386
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,270
iphone even if you never turn it off every

387
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,310
tot tells you it is necessary to enter the

388
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,050
pasture

389
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,770
because the fingerprint is valid for

390
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,250
48 hours and therefore when a phone is

391
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,400
taken seized, for example, it is not possible to

392
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,220
know how many times since the last

393
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,990
time the user entered the code

394
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,260
manually or have lowered  we are

395
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,930
close to 48 hours or not because

396
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,230
the issue of

397
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,700
digital fingerprints is important because at

398
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,490
present what for us is the only

399
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,240
technical way to pass a code

400
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,010
on the most modern phones is to

401
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:32,090
go and look on computers to which the

402
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,130
the trust certificate has been connected to the phone

403
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,440
the

404
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,590
synchronization certificate because every time

405
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,930
you connect the iphone to your

406
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,540
c  computer a certificate is generated on the computer

407
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,600
that basically allows

408
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
the computer and the phone to communicate

409
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,460
without the need for the phone to be

410
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,580
trivially unlocked when you plug the

411
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,800
phone to recharge the computer's usb port

412
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,060


413
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,870
if you try to go to the photos of the

414
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,730
iphone you see the photos even if  the

415
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,050
phone at that moment in a

416
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,440
locked state

417
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,390
this is the classic message that

418
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,850
comes out what happens when you click

419
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,850
on trust that a file is taken and

420
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,980
created on the computer with which

421
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,890
you are pairing your

422
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,570
phone problem of this file which

423
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,120
one is not  it is in no way dependent on the

424
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,640
machine so that file can be

425
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,280
moved to another computer and that new

426
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,150
computer becomes transfer for the iphone

427
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,420
according to this at the forensic level at

428
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:43,220
the user level the

429
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,090
lockdown certificates are not within the

430
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,510
windows environment either  in the mac environment they

431
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,980
are not inside the user's profile

432
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,620
but are in two system

433
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,929
folders  but

434
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:57,279
the fact that they are in two

435
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,230
system folders means that any other

436
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,990
user of that machine can see the

437
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,929
lockdown certificates which means

438
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:07,059
that if you want justice computer

439
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:11,049
attached to the flat the iphone attached

440
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:13,809
to the home computer to load and some

441
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,940
other  user logs in can see the data

442
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,350
of your iphone even if at that

443
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,970
moment the iphone to the lock code

444
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,740
because the lockdown certificate

445
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,340
allows him to communicate

446
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,259
what is the problem of

447
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:28,600
the usability of the lockdown certificates is that up

448
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,360
to verses 7 and  in part even with the first

449
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,820
8 different versions we could use it even

450
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,440
if the phone had been turned off,

451
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,940
that is, if the person to whom it was

452
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,519
kidnapped or spent too much time and

453
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,230
then the phone downloads the

454
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,690
certificate with 7 arrived it was valid

455
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,679
even after it was turned off so at the

456
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,779
first  reboot of the device

457
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:56,980
now no, that is, it is valid only substantially

458
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,490
it means it can only be used if the

459
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,119
phone has been found switched on and

460
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:06,759
less than 40 healthy less than 48 hours have passed

461
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,210
between finding the

462
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,659
lockdown certificate of the computer connect it to the all

463
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:16,600
iphone and have the data extracted once

464
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,730
the trust had operated we with different

465
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,919
analysis software forensic acquisition

466
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,360
we can bring out the data the other

467
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,129
important thing therefore,

468
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:33,009
only the machines of which you have full

469
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:33,690
control are authorized to trust

470
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,889
if someone is about to take your

471
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:38,320
phone you try to turn it off because if

472
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,169
you turn it off you essentially make the

473
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:43,499
lockdown certificate completely

474
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:46,499
unusable

475
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,669
someone passing by there are people passing

476
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:55,130
by to ask for  millantino the phone

477
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:59,429
so the second obvious there is the

478
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:02,360
next obvious suggestion is

479
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,809
delete

480
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:06,440
the lockdown certificates frequently

481
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,140
this is in the windows environment see

482
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,270
progra cyprus big data apple hawk down

483
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,100
then folder reachable by

484
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,760
all users lockdown certificates have

485
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,080
the name that depends on that  represents

486
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,130
the identifier of the telephone that has a

487
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,360
hardware ni  and unique that is

488
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,010
embedded inside the device at the

489
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,950
time of production so the name

490
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,250
is enough to make me understand which

491
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,960
device refers as the other

492
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,870
cloud on the other side from the phone we

493
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,880
can extract ask ludia id

494
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,159
even if the phone is locked so

495
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,620
we can  easy to understand which is the

496
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,899
lockdown certificate that matches with a

497
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:53,970
particular device even if that

498
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,140
has been turned off that is we can

499
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,760
turn it on and ask for the certifier I

500
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,200
am excited a slide no

501
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,080
ok backup surely it would go head of

502
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,559
your data it is useful if you want to make a

503
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,740
backup  local obviously do not make it

504
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,460
clear because if you do it in the clear all

505
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,830
the contents of your phone are

506
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,679
shot into our computer

507
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,380
each file represents an object taken

508
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,419
from your iphone it can be an image it

509
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,559
can be a video it can be a

510
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,559
sqlite database of sms  rather

511
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,000
than whatsapp or any other

512
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,980
application it is

513
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,230
therefore obvious that the choice of f

514
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,260
encrypted arlo is the most natural one so let's say

515
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,940
what is the problem that if you choose

516
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,390
a password that is too weak

517
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,940
you can do attacks whatever they are

518
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,960
whatever they are

519
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,460
there is a negative side effects in the fact

520
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,320
of making an encrypted backup

521
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,389
when you  I made an unencrypted backup on the

522
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:08,450
computer you are essentially making

523
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,489
all your data available to

524
00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:12,840
anyone who

525
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:19,350
passes take your backup but

526
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,970
the pci file and that is the mac keychain

527
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,269
if the backup is in clear text is encrypted

528
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:31,440
ante back up i.e. at the level

529
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,830
let's say  the iphone or ipad directly

530
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,379
takes care of encrypting the kitchen by

531
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:38,999
taking a key that is

532
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:41,999
inside a processor that in the devices an

533
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:45,779
area various things that is called sécure

534
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,239
enklave in 64-bit devices

535
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:52,590
however what happens is that the

536
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:56,100
chain  and encrypted upstream so you have

537
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,190
on the pct chen which is not readable because

538
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,470
we do not have the key

539
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,529
if instead you make an encrypted backup the

540
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:08,279
kitchen is encrypted with the password

541
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,649
that you have chosen as well as all the

542
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,980
other files this means that if I

543
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,460
manage to violate the password and then

544
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,980
read the backup I can also read

545
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,230
the realty content and what is

546
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,519
inside the pci is in all the passwords

547
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,720
of the  mail application all the

548
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,600
passwords of the wifi networks the

549
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,749
application authentication

550
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,999
tokens the facebook token the dropbox

551
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:41,369
token the linkedin token the hicks open tool

552
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:47,940
of little world maybe even what I do

553
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,480
with the token I take it out of the

554
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,100
encrypted backup and I  I connect the online services

555
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,799
without the need to know the password

556
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,840
because I have a totem that is valid at that moment

557
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,590
I simply have to pretend to

558
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,360
be an iphone

559
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,960
that is there are applications such as cloud

560
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,650
analyzer oxygen cloud detective that

561
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,320
using the tokens extracted from in this

562
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,179
case from the iphone but  even on android os

563
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:25,179
windows phone they use these tokens to

564
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:27,880
download to eventually access

565
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,840
online data

566
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:33,220
tomorrow if anyone wants to

567
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,650
continue the part  of lab today we

568
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,540
talked more about acquisition tomorrow

569
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,780
we will talk about analysis and we will also do a

570
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:44,220
little more on icloud

571
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,679
if you really want to make a backup on

572
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,980
icloud set a strong password but

573
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,220
that is not enough because apple can

574
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,100
provide data what it means apple

575
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,120
does not support the  b-style requests,

576
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,850
that is, they develop the operating system that

577
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,590
allows you to bruteforce the code

578
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:09,640
of your phone but

579
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,880
when the data is on their servers and

580
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,370
therefore the data we put them there more or

581
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,669
less voluntarily we apple on

582
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:22,470
request obviously with all  the

583
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,120
attention of the case from a legal point of view

584
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,979
provides the data to those who request them

585
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,030
even if you do not have to get to apple

586
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:42,429
in reality it is possible to extract the data

587
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:44,679
from the cloud but not only

588
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:47,679
the phone backup set on

589
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,740
icloud but also the files that

590
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,070
applications and put on icloud

591
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:56,559
because this is the thing that from josè

592
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,110
8.3 onwards has become an application practice,

593
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,669
that is, since there is no  'is the sd

594
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:07,200
and since the user does not backup the

595
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,059
iphone and since it happened to

596
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:14,620
my friend if she drank too many beers and

597
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,480
clicked wrong on the icon of

598
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,250
the whatsapp application

599
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,470
uninstall it you played everything only

600
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:26,289
iphone because  you played everything on an

601
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:29,320
iphone because every single file is

602
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,659
encrypted with a different key that is

603
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:33,640
deleted when the file is deleted and that

604
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,409
is why basically

605
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:37,090
recovering a file deleted from an

606
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,150
iphone a file deleted from an iphone is

607
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,659
an operation that we cannot  to

608
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:45,159
do what it takes to delete

609
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:47,110
the whatsapp application 3 seconds and

610
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,140
inside there is perhaps all life now

611
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,419
so what the applications

612
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:55,630
do allow you to make autonomous backups,

613
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:59,080
however, using the icloud space and then

614
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,429
for example then we go back

615
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:06,309
whatsapp somewhere  version for a

616
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:09,700
year when you update you and if

617
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,830
you have an iphone asks you want

618
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,960
to backup your chats

619
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,760
how often do you want to backup

620
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,630
the  chat

621
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,909
every day every week every month

622
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:23,230
every year but if an average user is

623
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,000
asked do you want to backup your chats he

624
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,760
says backup yes what is useful then

625
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,309
we make backups and facts make the backup

626
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:33,460
the backup ends up on icloud it is

627
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,470
possible there according to you we do it  this

628
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,140
black backup somehow no that is

629
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,140
the only form of security is your

630
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,909
user nor the username and password

631
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:46,270
of the icloud account associated with that

632
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,669
phone and then basically

633
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:51,100
we can go to download backups

634
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,230
we can go to download the

635
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,090
application files we can  also go to

636
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,490
download the photos

637
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,640
used the photos shared through the

638
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,659
photo sharing system of which now

639
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:06,669
does not escape the name

640
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:09,640
this is a feature

641
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,330
recently added by this software and it is quite

642
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,320
interesting

643
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,240
sorry I have to is quite interesting

644
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,760
because they discovered this

645
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,870
basically

646
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:29,649
when I  to active photo sharing,

647
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,490
if I delete an image from a device

648
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:37,220
, all the images are galvanized  agini

649
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,920
is deleted it ends up in a

650
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,850
trash can on icloud from which

651
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:48,490
I can within 30 days to take them out too bad

652
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:53,660
that in reality after 30 days the

653
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,540
images disappear from the

654
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,540
user's recycle bin but are not deleted

655
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,770
from the dub and from the apple server as

656
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,250
they have  made to notice this

657
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:11,030
when we say the photo sharing system on

658
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,879
the apple side then on the server side

659
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:16,520
to a sequel light identical to the

660
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,760
one inside the iphone that manages the

661
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,460
photo library inside which there

662
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,770
are all the gods of all  the photos that

663
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,830
have been part of the album both those

664
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,800
that are present and those that are

665
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,770
currently in the recycle bin but also the ids

666
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,960
of the images from the recycle bin

667
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,879
should have disappeared because

668
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,469
30 days have passed since

669
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:42,800
I deleted them how do I take out

670
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,199
an image  from the site

671
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,960
I make a guest request for

672
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,480
some file when I know the

673
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,560
file

674
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,750
name the file name is written in the

675
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,389
sequel light database and the image seriously for

676
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:58,130
it has not been deleted if I ask to

677
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,110
take that image the apple server

678
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,740
therefore essentially returns to the

679
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:08,390
current state the caring system of the

680
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,640
photos on icloud does not delete the images

681
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,190
of the moment in which the user asks to

682
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,210
delete it

683
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,390
and this is not so good this  the update

684
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,220
came out

685
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,150
August 28th the update is 30th

686
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,750
so I think that apple maybe a remedy

687
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,920
will try to put

688
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,620
us there are no more ap

689
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:48,100
ap that are based on icloud even

690
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,080
all

691
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,450
the photos that have been deleted

692
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,700
are automatically reconstructed I am four times that deletes  all

693
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,030
the photos that I do not want to go

694
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,160
around

695
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,350
this could be both from

696
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,950
whatsapp they are reconstructed

697
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,290
automatically again when

698
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:11,020
all the applications are synchronized

699
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,310
this every case must obviously be evaluated

700
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,820
but surely

701
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,650
the sharing system is not working one hundred percent

702
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,720
as let's put it this way  they have some problems

703
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,180


704
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,830
then but all this foresees

705
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:33,400
what goes well thanks thanks  ie

706
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,720
discretion all this you can

707
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,420
do if you know the username and

708
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,680
password of the user

709
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,510
because to download the iCloud backup

710
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,970
the photos or third-party data you must

711
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,130
know the username and password of the

712
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,430
user

713
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,010
which could be complicated

714
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:57,100
today we joked  a little bit about how much the

715
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,870
latest leaks from various websites are

716
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,090
causing a

717
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,920
headache they caused a headache so many people

718
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,330
go I hope not here about the ease of

719
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:17,230
currently recovering passwords the interesting thing,

720
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:21,640
however, also on the pc

721
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,100
there could be installed the application  of

722
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,640
icloud

723
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,560
on the other hand if I am a user who

724
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,530
uses the cloud also possible since

725
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,540
every just stalling itunes he tells me

726
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,400
you must absolutely install her cloud

727
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,400
control panel the average user because you

728
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,750
have to imagine that we

729
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,960
face it with the  average user

730
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,440
many have the application installed

731
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,940
obviously what happens in

732
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,160
the application stall I enter the

733
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,990
username and the passwor  d save the

734
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:54,430
credentials what

735
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,430
the application saves both on windows and on

736
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:00,640
mac salon token exactly like the tokens

737
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,530
that are saved on the iphone to

738
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,140
access social networks is paul salma on the pc

739
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,200
a token that is the user's token to

740
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,270
access  icloud and therefore this

741
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,220
software that I showed you before

742
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,960
when I go to download mode

743
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,020
indeed it is not seen better in the slide after

744
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:22,100
here I can choose whether to pass username

745
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,590
and password or token then a string and

746
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,410
that string we saw today in the

747
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,180
lab allows you  to access the

748
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,580
account quietly as if you

749
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,280
had the username and password it is

750
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,730
difficult to extract this token no it is

751
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,470
with software any of its

752
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,690
software gives you a three mega executable

753
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,840
that has been launched needs withdrawals to the

754
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,410
mini squeeze pulls you  out your dog

755
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,890
in a second

756
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,520
there is still an open source project on

757
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,650
tab which is called boldon in fleet which i

758
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,180
who is following the evolution of this

759
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,770
of these techniques for astonished that

760
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,280
p  To access online backups

761
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,440
obviously if you want to do anti forensics

762
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,130
do not jailbreaking

763
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:15,200
I know that it can be bad maybe to

764
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,600
say here but if at least and

765
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,910
you have to do it change the

766
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,790
root password that al pine on all apple devices from

767
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:26,570
iphone 3 to  iphone 6 I know

768
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,570
what the latest current is because

769
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,820
because if a jailbroken device

770
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,290
I can substantially know the

771
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,790
root password I can basically

772
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:43,430
load an application on the device

773
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,160
even with the device locked

774
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,910
because I connect directly via ssh I

775
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,130
load an application that I send

776
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,500
running and that makes me bruteforce the

777
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,470
passcode without activating the

778
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,790
apple decrease mechanisms

779
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,360
ok

780
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,619
last last two slides there are

781
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:10,700
side information that apple shoots on

782
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,520
your computers without you even

783
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,990
noticing it only when

784
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,270
obviously if you have itunes installed  and

785
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:22,030
if you use itunes to manage the iphone

786
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,540
all log files not all

787
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,920
log files all that  they made the

788
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,290
phone but the crash love so

789
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,360
basically the problems of the

790
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,910
applications that in reality are not

791
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,550
always just real

792
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:40,400
crashes are sometimes warnings they end up

793
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,800
on your pc inside the

794
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,119
user's profile folder

795
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,190
because this is  information because

796
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:50,690
for example the mail application writes

797
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,100
in here the names of all the attachments

798
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:57,100
that you have downloaded from the phone

799
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,520
the wi fi application writes the name and mac

800
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,619
address of all the wifi networks and which

801
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:06,710
you connect and therefore in any case with date

802
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,150
and now therefore this however

803
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,520
allows for example to locate a

804
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,290
phone in a certain place on a

805
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:16,190
certain date now the last slide

806
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:23,410
obviously could only be this

807
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,500
these are my contacts and if you want to

808
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,570
find it is not a commercial

809
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:38,590
proposal go and download it go  up on

810
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:42,950
wikileaks in the hacking team act you can

811
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,350
find it riak in team it was bought

812
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:48,140
so I'm pretty happy

813
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,030
you can find it inside  rno of the e-mail

814
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,520
they received from paquette pub

815
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,619
with the exact pdf attached

816
00:41:57,619 --> 00:41:59,180
no no no there is also all the exchange of

817
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,830
e-mails you can buy me this book it

818
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,579
seems interesting

819
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:06,210
enough thanks
