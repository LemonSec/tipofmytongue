1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,680
then everything welcome despite the

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,790
crazy heat

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,380
we have if I'm not mistaken about

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,480
forty minutes so we will do something fast

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,539
the title is trendy been many

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,039
innovations many problems at some

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,880
point I hope that fabio life appears too

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,369
I hope it appears I give you a nod then

9
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,920
you there  they are my fan boys if you are

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,860
standing up I have to tell you that I have a

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,690
fever so I am a bit stoned

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,270
the architect and pity south I was a lot and the

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,750
star or maybe super bright but let's

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,000
start then obviously he is

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,340
recording I put the  slow

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,770
recording photo that for posterity will remain

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,420
because this is not because to say emotional

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,280
what but simply to be a

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,469
little more free to speak especially in

20
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,840
a phase of debate that I would like to do

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,099
with you

22
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,740
towards the end of the representation

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,280
then who am I my name is andrea

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,630
what  manzoni

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,250
they told me no logo so I am

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,860
responsible for the cyber security of one

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,710
of the acme incorporated of a

28
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,740
fictitious company I deal with  many things i have

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,150
been in the observatory for national security i

30
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,549


31
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,840
collaborate call center maybe three

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,210
expressed reservations followed senses london are the

33
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,430
managerial races of a few things to super

34
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,439
clusit writes a piece of the

35
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,840
clusit report that the first piece not only you

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,689
know the first part the  first thirty

37
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,610
forty pages where there is the analysis of the

38
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,350
previous year's attacks a bit of

39
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,549
reasoning last year I had

40
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,579
the opportunity to collaborate in the

41
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:57,930
writing of the national

42
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,479
cyber security framework which was then published

43
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,719
this year is precisely I do  things I see

44
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,520
people I am not bored because I tell you

45
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,520
this because today we are dealing with a

46
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,610
very big topic, a topic that is more certainly of

47
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,330
very technical aspects, not

48
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,320
even of an economic, sociological and

49
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,660
cultural, political legal nature so to

50
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,110
explain to you what blows my

51
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,850
background my point of view on  its

52
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,780
business

53
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,440
today we do not talk about bits but of the

54
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,110
problems that this stuff

55
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,980
can this is definitely more and more in the

56
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,160
future  pro that was then what they are and

57
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,670
trendy state the state trend are a

58
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:51,030
pure and simple malware call

59
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,380
detectors they call them in many

60
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,030
nice ways but they are malware that clearly in

61
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,020
addition to the malware itself in its

62
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,850
various components when the control

63
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,140
makes all the structures that

64
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,709
obviously serves for command and control

65
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,340
a whole series of needs of those who

66
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,630
use these systems

67
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,880
according to a very old definition of

68
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,250
the American defense department

69
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,269
this table is from 2001

70
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,040
ok we think this is

71
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,040
new stuff instead this is ancient stuff as

72
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,870
we will see shortly

73
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,269
only  that now inevitably due to the

74
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,820
penetration of technologies into

75
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,850
everyone's life and therefore the frequency of

76
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,010
use of these systems the number

77
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,640
of people who are attentive and

78
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,080
all you know is happening

79
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,640
cybercrime interventions now we

80
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,739
talk about it but this stuff has existed for twenty years

81
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:51,970
at least you don't have in 2001 the US

82
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,980
State Department says whoever

83
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,620
does it would re  schio reais that is, because it is

84
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,690
done for information to ask for

85
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,430
information gathering or theft of

86
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,420
intellectual property

87
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,340
cyber attacks because they are done to

88
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,989
sabotage the functions of a

89
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,630
computer network for reasons of

90
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,500
national security or as an equivalent or as

91
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,529
support for a kinetic attack of  an

92
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:23,850
armed attack and instead cyber warfare

93
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,540
according to them from a final point of view

94
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,180
only states do it,

95
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,660
something that the lawyer stefano lena and I have

96
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,240
been discussing fiercely for

97
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,000
years because he says yes and I

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,800
say no right  and of course destroy

99
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,420
the networks for reasons of

100
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,160
national security in the event of an armed conflict

101
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,120
etc.

102
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,590
well ok this is the theory historically

103
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,680
what happened that those who today think

104
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,290
of using

105
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,760
malware for criminal investigation purposes have

106
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,840
a two-story history  of stories

107
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,460
mainly in a group comes from here

108
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,860
ok before it has provided this type of

109
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,460
buyers and has been doing it

110
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,470
since the early years  90 end of 80 or it

111
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,940
comes from here ok or it comes from those

112
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,380
who initially did

113
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,880
traditional telephone wiretapping

114
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,060
which at a certain point had begun to

115
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,870
differentiate because a market was created

116
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,000
for instruments that were not

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,920
simply probes listening points

118
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,710
etc.

119
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,980
whoever is

120
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,680
behind the so-called

121
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,250
IT captain is indistinguishable from a

122
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,920
malware used for espionage and

123
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,980
even more and more as they

124
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,530
become sophisticated even by tools

125
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,250
used by cyber crime and is not a

126
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,080
bug

127
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,660
many of those who have the history that they

128
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,570
see wiretapping propose

129
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,670
these tools as if they were

130
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,160
very sophisticated bugs but these

131
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,770
are not bugs

132
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,110
these are software that take

133
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,210
absolute control of the

134
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,490
compromised device are active objects

135
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,390
are objects that can create

136
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,920
evidence of its objects that only

137
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,969
root on these machines

138
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:37,769
are objects that  cancel  all

139
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:39,179
the logos and all the traces of what they

140
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,659
are doing

141
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:45,869
in addition at least up to now are

142
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:50,239
basically all or mostly

143
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:53,729
because they are outsourced on

144
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:56,579
government commission or because a market is being created

145
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:58,139
so someone developing and

146
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,749
then trying to sell governments are

147
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:02,899
anyway  products of private companies

148
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:06,509
the level historically applied to

149
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,779
this stuff in terms of oversight i.e.

150
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,199
what's in the code how it's

151
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,669
really used who does

152
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,949
the developers who developed

153
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:21,599
where they go when they leave the company

154
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,999
where they created the sensor etc all

155
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:26,639
this stuff doesn't  is currently

156
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,379
minimally tracked and these subjects

157
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:33,709
therefore live a kind of limbo

158
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,819
facing the fact that the market is

159
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,339
opening up the demand for these things

160
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:41,389
is increasing exponentially

161
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:45,360
race has less and less even if it's funny

162
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,099
I have to say it is a pity for the camera

163
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:52,439
that the same kind of rather

164
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,509
sophisticated rath that you find in the underground

165
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:56,419
for 50 euros

166
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:59,639
these here and it  they charge 5

167
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,209
million euros which I imagine will end sooner or later

168
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,189
because they will realize that it is a

169
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:13,610
bit of a poke anyway ok

170
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:21,389
that my assistant has arrived too ok

171
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,639
ancient history look at when

172
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,800
this is a 19

173
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,849
2001 report for congress today  us official

174
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,010
syndicate del north atlantic thrills

175
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,280
tuenti countries in 2001 had linz

176
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,830
kind of information operations directive

177
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,440
dancing art stays are continually

178
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,640
attacked all the same estimate has to do with

179
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,370
2030 you know that the story of the

180
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,550
kooks and is from the end of the 80s

181
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,740
ok qua fastforward  let's pass in the ancient

182
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:09,240
but not so ancient 2013 140 nations in

183
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,620
ten years from twenty have increased by 1

184
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,850
in magnitude to bold 140 nations have

185
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,830
built have already built here they

186
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,910
wrote in 2013 cyber offense of fes

187
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,780
capabilities

188
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,300
everyone knows that it seems it would be space

189
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,460
everyone wants to be perceived  also

190
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,650
for a reason of image as in the

191
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,100
game there is absolutely

192
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,960
nothing defined so everyone does what he

193
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,160
wants  re

194
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,240
is not that there is an

195
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,420
international treaty but there is not even the idea

196
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,430
of having an international conference on

197
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,120
these things

198
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,089
now that maybe if they start talking about it

199
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,010
someone will do it it will take five years

200
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,290
to organize it then no one will say

201
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,850
that there is  a big problem

202
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,520
because the perception of the dangerousness

203
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,589
of these things that in the case of

204
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:00,740
bacteriological weapons to say or chemical is

205
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,250
more read is very low and consequently

206
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,690


207
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,260
almost nobody is seriously dealing with this topic it is not

208
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,530
right to say anyone but which nobody and

209
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,170
then  no one wants to commit those who

210
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,960
would like to take away the advantage of being able to

211
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,330
use this stuff

212
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,630
linen the context of very

213
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,089
difficult attribution without having

214
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:29,000


215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,920
to answer to anyone and then see there are a few questions

216
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,490
stuxnet it was an act of war that

217
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,930
the united states must do against

218
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,250
Chinese companies this internal document

219
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,690
of the pentagon so they ask themselves the

220
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,610
questions and what if there is a

221
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,120
patriottic hacker di dos  i will know about the russians

222
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,880
without naming them been sponsored that is with

223
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,410
say government cohabitation covers

224
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,810
actually it is a problem we are

225
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,560
coming back i don't know if you like history

226
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,070
i love it

227
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,790
in fact we are going back to 1600 when

228
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,250
the queen of england gave francis

229
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,360
francis drake the driving license  I ran to

230
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,360
be a privateer and told him I

231
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,330
don't want to know what to do if

232
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,680
the Spanish ships sink better ok

233
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,510
here we are in the same scenario and

234
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,830
this from a point of view of law

235
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,060
and international order brings us

236
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,430
back because these objects are

237
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,650
objectively dangerous very powerful

238
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,440
you have seen what a mess happened for

239
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,240
which the clinton e-mail

240
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,830
[ __ ] that was total [ __ ]

241
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,110
that is this had us the messenger in the

242
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,110
basement he deleted the e-mails with

243
00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:00,870
bleachbit as if to say [ __ ] b is one

244
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,840
simply ok it was total [ __ ]

245
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,040
made  with mutual aid tools in the face

246
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,160
of an indefensible and defenseless target

247
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,800
that you imagine using stuff a  a little more

248
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,200
serious than what kind of mess can be

249
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,210
done there are people who say the

250
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,270
American elections will be altered by

251
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:30,640
Russian hackers or that today,

252
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,800
what happens today, everything happens to you today

253
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,180
but I took this example because I

254
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,680
really like

255
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,000
here we talk about the  case of amet ma mansur

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,700
ahmed mansur and this

257
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,600
emirate activist who receives in a rather naïve way in my opinion

258
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,410
I am amazed

259
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,610
indeed the fake sms are clearly

260
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,100
strange where they ask him to click

261
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,330
on things

262
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,980
he is quite on the who lives also

263
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,530
because they have already had a hole in him  the phone

264
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,420
the pc 50 times turns to citizen lab

265
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,580
which together with lookout that the

266
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:15,340
antivirus company for mobile devices do

267
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,630
a beautiful analysis and discover that if

268
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,190
you clicked on that link

269
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,290
a deal codenamed

270
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,540
pegasus would have been installed which contains 30 of the per  iphone

271
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,250
that give him total control

272
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,190
of the victim's iphone with a consequence of that

273
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,910
click

274
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,410
in 100 percent of cases ok so a

275
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,640
crazy successful network

276
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,140
this system by doing three backs of the

277
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,470
sample that they have obtained towards the

278
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,900
proxies and then infrastructure systems which it

279
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,130
controls etc.

280
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,470
seems to belong to the company

281
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,070
called our group that by profession does

282
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,470
these things clearly a

283
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,460
slaughter happens because all the most

284
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,780
sensitive souls cry scandal  no

285
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,310
compared to the poor

286
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,030
persecuted activist no those maybe a little less

287
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,290
worried about these aspects say

288
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,980
damn someone takes the

289
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,200
trouble to use such an

290
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,190
expensive and complicated infrastructure for a nobody

291
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,490
like this here he told us

292
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,270
ok this means that this  what

293
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,580
is widespread

294
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,980
because this painting is bin laden is one

295
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,980
who lives in the light of the sun nor the emirates

296
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,440
if he were one in the least disliked the

297
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,779
regime the pine tree roots would have already ended

298
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:47,019
ok moment the fact that he is free

299
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,519
means that he can do

300
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,769
anything that  he knows it's a lily

301
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:53,620
ok yet they took the trouble of

302
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,139
ferrara like that with the 3 0 day for

303
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:59,069
iphone that  cost an arm and a leg will

304
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:00,670
commission the

305
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,999
specialized company that does this there is this

306
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:07,540
in my opinion if we say one comes out of the

307
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,800
more sentimental, more visceral aspect

308
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,449
of the matter it should make us think a

309
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:16,930
lot because it is a symptom of the

310
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,120
frequency of ease with

311
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,480
which these things are done too  for irrelevant targets

312
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,779


313
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:26,589
frankly relevant ok thing that I have not

314
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:28,029
found read of the writing

315
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:30,600
anywhere that is this but on which nobody

316
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,670
yet attentive in this way at

317
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,430
these levels at these costs

318
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,449
this means that a foul with

319
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:38,589
everyone

320
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:40,319
ok or in any case with the amount of people

321
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:44,410
statistically huge I would be amazed if

322
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,490
it weren't so good ok so this

323
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,019
thing comes out a big

324
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:53,529
casino there is between let's see what will happen

325
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:56,290
there is a thriving market of people

326
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,689
doing research who find zero day which is

327
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:00,579
obviously already procuring so it is already

328
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:05,740
procured I'm wrong perhaps already

329
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,350
procured further zero days because one

330
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,269
also already receives the system

331
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,189
keep going calmly and

332
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:15,910
blissfully with new zero days despite

333
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,629
apple

334
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:20,019
I have to say in ten days ago it

335
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:24,819
released from fish ten days is not

336
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:27,759
a bad weather second all in all

337
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,490
it can not be said that they have not been

338
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,819
reactive

339
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:35,519
ok while all this mess is happening

340
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,690
a little more  months ago

341
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,690
there is a sentence that goes into the sentence

342
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,650
of the cassation in a proceeding where

343
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,980
a certain applicant asks this question

344
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,760
talking about the detectors even in the

345
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,440
places of private residence which are

346
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,860
obviously particularly protected

347
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,850
from the inviolable home constitutional level

348
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,400
also in the  new

349
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,450
private residence pursuant to article 614 also not

350
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,339
individually identified even if

351
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,960
there is no criminal activity is taking place

352
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,099
at that moment

353
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,480
the interception of

354
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,220
conversations or communications between

355
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,960
present is allowed by installing the

356
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,640
computer quarryman in

357
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,290
portable electronic devices for example

358
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,930
personal computer tab on his etc.

359
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:34,170
translation m  if the guy who has the

360
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,590
Camorrista cousin goes because we see him

361
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,900
come in or go out to find I'm cousin him and

362
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,940
clean tries he finds the cousin I

363
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,060
can put a sensor on his

364
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,800
android phone so that when I'm

365
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,210
there in the kitchen they make coffee  I hear

366
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,370
through the microphone of the smartphone

367
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,920
what the Camorra cousin is saying to

368
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,040
that other and then I can use this

369
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,130
evidence that this is the most

370
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,580
important question I can hear it but they are worth

371
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:13,210
ok and the cassation responds in

372
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,520
a disturbing way

373
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,009
in my opinion because  he says yes to a

374
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:23,600
limited extent proceedings relating to

375
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,750
organized crime crimes,

376
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:35,210
even terrorist excuses, meaning

377
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,090
those listed in article 51 as well as

378
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,759
those in any case belonging to

379
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,860
a criminal association with

380
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,750
the exclusion of the mere concurrence of

381
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,940
persons then the association for

382
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,730
delinquent then him  maybe he will correct me

383
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,179
the rai coffers is quite discretionary

384
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:59,840
as in this case it is not very

385
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,429
restrictive it can be given to

386
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:04,720
criminal association also for things heard now

387
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,750
sorry but the fever is consuming it

388
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,320
ok so basically there

389
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,679
are two words that are bad ok

390
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,259
as much as formalism provided it is perfect it

391
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:22,940
says organized crime that also

392
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,460
terrorist and therefore this also

393
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,149
because today the  definition of

394
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:35,750
terrorist activity is a little weak i

395
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,200
'm proselytizing on twitter for them

396
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,580
the islamic state is what is what i

397
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,200
am in the mosque frankly

398
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,889
obviously i am not particularly in fact

399
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:53,779
not at all in favor of the isawi state but

400
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:56,090
from the point of view of law and  of the

401
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,860
protection I ask myself the problem I am the imam

402
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,840
of a mosque who obviously in a

403
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,049
garage of one of the Italian cities and

404
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:07,700
I say extreme things sultan oristano I am

405
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,049
a terrorist

406
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:12,559
the meeting of three or more people in

407
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,470
this garage constitutes an association and

408
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,720
then even worse this anyway

409
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,840
it seems to restrict

410
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,000
the crimes of kate

411
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,149
organized in organized italy only in cases of association  with the

412
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,700
purpose of terrorism,

413
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,570
that is, association with the purpose of

414
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:39,260
terrorism as well as those in any case

415
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,880
belonging to the criminal association

416
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,320
means that a third of the

417
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,750
suspects in Italy can be the

418
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,940
subject of the installation of a

419
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,760
reform act field because in some

420
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,240
way they have a good criminal association

421
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:05,090
response of the cassation makes

422
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,130
some people get stomach ache

423
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,770
in the meantime, however, work is

424
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,029
underway on the definition of an

425
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:20,179
Italian law which is actually re-presented by

426
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:24,140
a senator called a Greek now a

427
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,440
deputy I do not know however a person who

428
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,299
is obviously used to re-propose

429
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,990
a legislation already rejected two years ago

430
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,620
which is rather Orwellian rather

431
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,890
very Borrellian at this point the

432
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:48,470
whole group of characters is created who

433
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,809
begin to lobbying begin to make

434
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,250
noise to protest etc. etc.

435
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,450
so they go to discuss the third of

436
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,890
this legislation substantially

437
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,289
resubmitted as follows  how was that

438
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:02,020
bowl  ta with the excuse of the

439
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,929
terrorism emergency with the excuse of brussels of

440
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:12,020
nice of this stuff here and it is

441
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,610
basically quintarelli fabio is

442
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,899
another if of people who leave

443
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:23,059
I remember it and convince of the

444
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:25,070
need to introduce a whole series

445
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,740
of controls a whole series of  guarantees

446
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,039
a whole series of procedures that he

447
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,970
now does here he tells us

448
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,530
now he tells us very well much

449
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,820
less than what he will be able to do because he

450
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,060
knows this story very well

451
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,620
I premise that what they have

452
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,520
done in my opinion is right in itself but

453
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,350
will not  the hoped-for effects for a series of

454
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,900
regions that maybe we discuss later

455
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,560
now we see dallarda the lively persuasive

456
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,310
voice of fabio that happened I

457
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:05,560
exposed myself and I leave you space then that

458
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,690
there is in the amendments of the PDL on

459
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,400
computer detectors to this

460
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,840
extemporaneous intervention because we

461
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,140
were talking about it  first ad can ab caps a

462
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,870
technical definition then about a year

463
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,880
ago with senator quintarelli

464
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,860
the lawyer stefano aterno and andrei  di

465
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,420
verdini and here too we have

466
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,410
started a political,

467
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,160
technical and legal working group to create a

468
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
law proposal for the regulation

469
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,410
of the use of computer detectors

470
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,000
by the police so

471
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,740
we are talking not about their use

472
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,180
in the context of  international national intelligence

473
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,190
but of the use by

474
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,650
law enforcement agencies in Italy with the

475
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,260
aim of getting out of what

476
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,360
lawyers call boys or legis, that

477
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,850
is, it is not regulated as a tool and

478
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,890
introducing a series of very

479
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,740
strong guarantees both from a legal point of view  that

480
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,320
from a technical procedural point of view and

481
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,480
it was not an easy job it is not certain

482
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,590
that we will be able to complete

483
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,690
it on 8 September in parliament

484
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,940
an amendment to the bill will be presented for the

485
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,800
rewriting of the criminal trial code

486
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,450
disclosure of public legislation is made

487
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,220
I will not tell you  all the

488
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,090
way we say

489
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,139
legislative type but in this way

490
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:24,970
we had a draft in march we

491
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,740
did u  n conference in the Senate

492
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,940
inviting all the main

493
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,919
representatives of the institutions or those who

494
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,259
have an impact at an

495
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:33,970
institutional level to collect their

496
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,830
opinion on this bill and

497
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,970
therefore have a first cycle of

498
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,470
iteration of bugfixes in this standard

499
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,629
but what are the problems that  there are

500
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:42,369
in the national use

501
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:44,799
today the rule the detector that is the

502
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,929
trojan is not regulated by the code of

503
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:48,610
criminal procedure in the code of procedure

504
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,529
there are written all those

505
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:54,070
activities that for investigative justice purposes

506
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,960
can be done for

507
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,249
example it is written for the

508
00:24:57,249 --> 00:24:58,749
wiretapping can be

509
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:01,119
done for these crimes for a long time

510
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:03,070
extendable in this way and these are

511
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,600
things that must be done only if then

512
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,220
criminal procedure

513
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,039
the trojan is not there so today trojan is

514
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,320
an atypical tool this what it

515
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,049
means that a magistrate

516
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:16,330
can self-authorize  the use of the

517
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,039
trojan maybe in a preliminary investigation phase

518
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:21,970
use it to collect  iere

519
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,610
the evidence he wants and not document it

520
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,789
even leading to dynamics in which computer detectors

521
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:30,249
are used in even minor crimes

522
00:25:30,249 --> 00:25:32,649
the trojans maybe

523
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:34,269
the information is understood that on

524
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:35,769
that computer in that folder there is

525
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:38,259
precisely that file that is incriminating of

526
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:39,970
that person maybe the  disk was

527
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,710
encrypted but the less password is

528
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,320
still taken they do not write anything from the

529
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,389
point of view let's say the

530
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:48,759
investigative procedure that the trojan was used

531
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:50,559
and coincidentally they make a

532
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,389
seizure that day exactly in that

533
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:54,039
place and then find fairies they also manage

534
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,200
to avoid them so today  the player is

535
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,730
often used in these ways

536
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,379
this is one of the problems due to the fact that

537
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:01,240
an atypical tool must therefore be made

538
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,580
typical, i.e. regulated by the

539
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,320
code of criminal procedure and this is

540
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,570
a basic requirement it is not possible to say

541
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,580
no we do not use the tool because  is

542
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,070
used and will be used can this

543
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,679
fusion that finds the necessary oppositions

544
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:16,360
in the ambit  activity for civil rights

545
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:16,899


546
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:20,259
more than legitimate and there are a

547
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:21,490
number of problems that we have

548
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,139
tried to address in this

549
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:23,950
bill,

550
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,639
the first of which is that the trojan is a

551
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:29,350
tool that once it is on the

552
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,539
phone device computer in fact

553
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:33,660
it allows you to make a series

554
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,520
of information acquisitions that are already

555
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,110
regulated by the criminal procedure code

556
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,600
because it allows you to

557
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,760
search for your files a

558
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,160
seizure I download the files an

559
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,870
interception of communications between those

560
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,330
present of the bug of which the house

561
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,950
on which the cassation entered  on the merits

562
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,200
a telematic interception of

563
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,330
interception the gmail traffic before the

564
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,960
ssl a telephone interception of

565
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,060
interception the phone calls that

566
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,280
you make the localization then I will follow you by

567
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,800
taking the gps

568
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,530
data the cell data these cases are

569
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,330
already regulated by the

570
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,520
criminal procedure code in which  it says they

571
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,830
can be done within these limits for

572
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,750
these  types of crimes with these types of

573
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,090
constraints and for all the time in fact today

574
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,340
a magistrate if he wanted to ask the

575
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,170
judges who went criminals that he makes me

576
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,910
use the sensor to prosecute

577
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,290
this person and I want the water to

578
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,520
collect only his gps coordinates

579
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,630


580
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,280
as the following a  something

581
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,540
quite light

582
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,700
maybe the investigating judge who authorizes it but

583
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,470
once the Trojan is inside he can

584
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,030
actually acquire all the information

585
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,890
he wants this because because the

586
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,630
tools are not regulated

587
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,910
so we tried to do

588
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,610
what is the mapping from a regulatory point of view

589
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,190
of the

590
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,710
capabilities of the Trojan's functionalities compared to

591
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,040
those that are the elements of the

592
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,870
criminal procedure code introducing a new one

593
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,330
that concerns the acquisition of

594
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,620
remote data because the most

595
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,870
sensitive of all is the fact that I can

596
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,810
download files and check

597
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,900
file not one shot but for a period of

598
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,350
time

599
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,420
this is something that does not govern the

600
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,010
criminal code ie if someone  or he comes to

601
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,570
your house and wants to do a search

602
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,620
and seizure

603
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,300
there is an obligation to notify that is

604
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,860
to say he has to tell you imagine in my opinion I put in the

605
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,660
trojan and says 8 admitted the trojan now

606
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,920
starts downloading the files

607
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,230
in short, it would not work but this there

608
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,670
also says that the invasiveness of the

609
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,350
instrument compared

610
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,060
to remote data acquisition is much higher than

611
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,410
search and seizure and therefore as

612
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,110
a new case is

613
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,030
introduced, a series of

614
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,450
technical and procedural aspects are introduced such as

615
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,260
the obligation to ask the

616
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,670
judge for investigations  preliminary to

617
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,110
using the trojan today is not

618
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,820
necessary because our typical mint

619
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,800
is introduced the need to have

620
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,029
trojans that are certified

621
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:48,729
logged in there is an entity this case in

622
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,139
Italy is called isti com which has a

623
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:51,519
division is called the ceva which is

624
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,719
deals with certification for

625
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,519
state security technologies

626
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,809
everything that is

627
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:57,940
military classified common criteria must pass  from there it

628
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,909
is a common thing we say we want to

629
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:02,409
ensure that all trojans and that they are

630
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:04,719
used that is cup for computer scientists

631
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:06,519
for compliance with this type of guarantees

632
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:09,849
are part of they are certified and not

633
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:12,669
produced by pippo srl which is in the

634
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,830
basement of the province and as a friend

635
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,659
that  of the power of attorney in which the head

636
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:18,429
at that point can do everything

637
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:20,019
we have introduced the obligation to

638
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:22,029
deposit in the file a copy of

639
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:23,669
the binary code of the trojan

640
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:26,589
the obligation to introduce a log of

641
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:28,869
all the operation of the trojan to be

642
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:31,179
part of since it is therefore produced

643
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:33,429
from the manufacturer to when it is instanced

644
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:35,889
in the prosecutor's office which perhaps has

645
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:37,629
polymorphic characteristics to when it

646
00:29:37,629 --> 00:29:39,519
is installed because the footprints of

647
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,249
these hunters are different on and

648
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:44,619
this log must guarantee the integrity

649
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:46,269
of Daniela temporal continuity must

650
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:47,619
be attached to the file this would

651
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,450
allow the defense of through the

652
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,099
own expert to be able to analyze that

653
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:53,289
this troy actually could

654
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:57,029
to do only those things and not others

655
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:11,330
can be yes yes

656
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:18,800
ok ok

657
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:27,879
for certification for

658
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:29,519
certification we

659
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,659
have already faced this for

660
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:33,669
certification the certification path

661
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:35,049
as per

662
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:38,139
technical specification is filed requires that there

663
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:39,849
is certification done at least  once a

664
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:41,409
year the filing of the

665
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:43,269
source codes all the certified versions

666
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:46,269
by the producers and

667
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:47,889
a national register of

668
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:49,599
computer detectors is established in which

669
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,219
all the footprints must be registered

670
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:55,299
and the hunters certainly change

671
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:57,159
but it is a question of plural instead of

672
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:59,379
saying  the hunter the sensors the data

673
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:01,029
are cheap and therefore we can create

674
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:06,759
everything it is not a problem as long as there is

675
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:08,379
or of ting it is enough that it is possible to

676
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:11,049
trace that from that heat that is here

677
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:12,729
or that has changed seven times

678
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:14,919
for reasons of paul my film update

679
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:17,559
this  must be in the log to the file

680
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,299
the defense expert must be able to

681
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:21,580
validate it the expert must be you  tto

682
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,960
registered in the

683
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,269
national register of hunters which must allow

684
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:28,299
the defense to be able to verify that that

685
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:29,619
sensor had only those

686
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:31,479
capabilities that it was certified and not

687
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:33,580
only that it was instantiated by

688
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,469
that prosecutor competent for that type

689
00:31:35,469 --> 00:31:47,889
of investigation exactly in

690
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:52,179
this case  exactly in this case

691
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:55,029
you must give the right to the defense to

692
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:57,639
be able to repeat the guarantee

693
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:00,909
chain and at the same time it must not prevent the

694
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:02,469
judicial authority from doing

695
00:32:02,469 --> 00:32:04,059
its job the balance between

696
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:05,889
these two things is extremely

697
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:08,710
complicated and it is not that  you can take

698
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,479
a shot it is obvious that when we

699
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:13,389
talked to the anti-mafia management or

700
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,179
the cnaipic they tend much more than to

701
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:17,109
have a free hand

702
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,879
when you talk to those who deal with

703
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:20,830
civil law or research in the field of

704
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,989
jurisprudence of these issues there is  a

705
00:32:22,989 --> 00:32:25,719
greater greater guarantee approach

706
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:27,849
the important thing is to have a path that

707
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:31,059
allows ex post when c  'it is

708
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:31,570


709
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,630
a judgment a debate to be able to

710
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,610
retrace the guarantee chain and

711
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,320
verify that that sensor

712
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,460
could only do what it

713
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,860
could actually do and that that

714
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,700
sensor was used in

715
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,020
compliance with the law even

716
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,970
with respect to the hypothesis of

717
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,890
malicious backdoors inserted  it is

718
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,800
no coincidence that the manufacturer inserts

719
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,850
the mandatory filing of

720
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,440
source codes which here may seem

721
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,650
incredible but in france it is normal as

722
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,630
the certification is done from the price list

723
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:08,110
but in the division of the cev to the body

724
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,580
that deals with safety certifications in italy

725
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,530
for the whole world of

726
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,880
the art of state security technologies

727
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,370
and which makes the common criteria,

728
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,990
the reminder of having

729
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,940
compliance with the more concrete via at

730
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,160
least level and al2 which guarantee certain

731
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,270
yachting requirements

732
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,780
is also defined that the defense

733
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,790
assumed there is evidence from the

734
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,210
hunter log or log analysis

735
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,220
of non-compliance with respect to the

736
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,640
possible certification can repeat

737
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,200
and there you also enter into

738
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,390
contractual problems of confidentiality producers

739
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,220
that are far from easy to

740
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,160
unravel and can repeat the

741
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,540
certification process in a controlled environment by

742
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,770


743
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,530
analyzing the source codes and having the

744
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:53,020
possibility to reproduce  with cdr

745
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,300
produces ball bild the exact copy of the

746
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,650
track that was attached to the

747
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,250
file

748
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,560
this is the only method of a

749
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,510
legal technical procedural type that

750
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,490
allows you to have an end

751
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,820
to end guarantee with respect to but who guarantees me

752
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,670
that it is obvious that it is very difficult

753
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,179
I can

754
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:19,290
use exactly I cannot say I am in

755
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,659
love with the approach because it is

756
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,480
correct even if applying

757
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,400
the analogy in a context of this

758
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,940
kind goes up to a certain point

759
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,739
as an exercise because as oil says

760
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,679
before for the seizure an account is

761
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,770
if I notify you that he entered your house and

762
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:42,780
took away your floppies, one thing is if,

763
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,909
without your knowledge, I hole your TV  fono e mi

764
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,770
discharge uses on this in the new

765
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,960
legal case of remote search and

766
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,750
seizure

767
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,850
the mandatory notification remains but as a

768
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,889
delayed notification that normally

769
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:57,480
opens in cases of mafia and terrorism and

770
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,850
which is the only type of crime

771
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,070
in which  it is possible to adopt this type

772
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,660
of approach but then this is

773
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,850
parliamentary debate to which crimes it applies you

774
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,370
make a conservative proposal try to

775
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,930
make a proposal that is the best

776
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:13,200
points a thousand to get maybe 500

777
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,810
here I can tell you what widows

778
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,020
being old cynical and  tired as a

779
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,640
possible scenario

780
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,060
I see this first of all if the

781
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,620
written norm remains poems the interpretation

782
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,630
of the cassation is not overcome

783
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:31,910
by the sentence that you amend in an

784
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,250
important sense what has been said

785
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,380
everyone will get associations so

786
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,690
I can flex the sensor not on the

787
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,490
phone the bad guy  I don't know who it is that

788
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:44,040
said bad guy but on the phone of

789
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,600
the cousin's aunt and bad king  who still

790
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,490
frequents the circles etc. then after

791
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,830
we go to show it takes 15 years

792
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,620
that this accusation was unfounded

793
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,910
while I was able to investigate

794
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,190
the phone of the nephew's company

795
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,960
etc. which obviously does not bother

796
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,060
to be controlled while instead it

797
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,040
will leave a thriving market  and

798
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,460
anti-computer detectors are already being born

799
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,740
in fact from people who will have a lot of

800
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,520
ok customers and an extra [ __ ] will happen

801
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,820
I don't know if you have seen I had

802
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,250
a nice slide but I am the label to

803
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,560
put it also for the fever is an email

804
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,760
that in reality

805
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,310
sheen who was sent in italian has

806
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,990
a lot of women with children and daughters

807
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,670
because open source intelligence are

808
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,130
at all from facebook and these women

809
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,260
got a targeted email saying dear

810
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,420
lady she is a gorgeous 16

811
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,240
year old daughter you can't let her go out  in the

812
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,330
evening without knowing who he goes with what the

813
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:53,760
[ __ ] does he do if he takes drugs if not then for only

814
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,570
19 euros and 99 we provide you with this

815
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,820
monitor tool  your daughter's trip

816
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,360
remotely so you can make the peace of knowing

817
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,900
what to do this obviously is a

818
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,130
variant, let's say of cybercrime origin,

819
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,200
of a computer detector

820
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,230
first then does exactly the same things

821
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,720
in the sense that if you buy it, what

822
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,760
are you doing you are giving 19 euros 90 to

823
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,820
criminals and at that point you have access to the

824
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,820
phone and your daughter fur laxis but

825
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,830
they have it too

826
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,720
so what happens if this one

827
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,240
here with the boyfriend with the girlfriend

828
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,430
takes pictures her mini weird after a year

829
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,310
second are on sale in the circuits

830
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,880
of child pornography

831
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,570
ok etcetera etcetera etcetera 15 year old

832
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,490
business stuck in the fact that they

833
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:50,370
even almost sell you the rat with

834
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,410
which you infect the phone of the

835
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,140
best daughter who then finds herself the

836
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,930
sex tape exchanged by his

837
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,810
classmates because from the site from the

838
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,750
pedophile ring he succeeded  on the internet

839
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,510
of someone who knows her ok

840
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,020
these things are happening then

841
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,589
so

842
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:15,440
crazy marked of anti detectors

843
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,940
c  whoever in the universe who knows more or

844
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,839
less xor will try to get into

845
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,200
this market because people who

846
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,670
don't understand [ __ ] about these things stop

847
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,999
saying how much I have to give you to keep

848
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:33,180
my phone safe from this

849
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,430
stuff or  continuously monitored so

850
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,339
if I put it on the apple tree I immediately realize

851
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:40,589
this will be a huge problem

852
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:42,359
then there is the whole problem of criminals

853
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,489
who will do different business models over us

854
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,410


855
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,930
often if service and then there are four

856
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,450
problems that as manager of

857
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,180
a division  of 150 Christians who will do in

858
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,259
the morning in the evening for test reversing

859
00:38:58,259 --> 00:38:59,460
assessment etcetera

860
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,119
I these four questions four

861
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,690
random scenarios one I do an appraisal

862
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,390
for an

863
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:14,519
ok customer who maybe for any reason and

864
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,369
I find a sensor on the iphone of the

865
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:20,269
mass between delegate or of ciccillo cacace

866
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:24,569
crimes or whoever I know very well step

867
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:27,839
on this I am a year in input that

868
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,089
I do then I have a contract with

869
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:32,910
this client where I wrote that in

870
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,099
ba  if the civil code article more but

871
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:38,279
I undertake to do my job in a

872
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:39,299
workmanlike manner

873
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:43,769
etc. etc. that does not explode and not

874
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:45,499
to see ok but towards him

875
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:50,460
what I do I do a bit of three sims

876
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,229
in the studio this is what I realize that

877
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:55,710
refers to the platform of our

878
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,469
range of pippero ok this is a

879
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:00,869
footballer it could be cyber

880
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:04,109
intelligence it could be law

881
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:08,489
enforcement who does who I say if I

882
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,849
say someone I take it away from a lawyer for

883
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:13,160
sure

884
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,260
I want the red phone with my

885
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:21,589
lawyer we have  I say I tell him I

886
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:24,140
leave him there me the studio

887
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,020
I avoid touching him but he goes a couple

888
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:33,980
to Rome except as a story that is not a

889
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,609
trojan

890
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:37,940
I say or [ __ ] on the iphone history

891
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,339
delegate there is a bastard tram that is

892
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:41,720
doing things

893
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,539
like that  it is who he talks with what he does that techniques he

894
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:46,730
uses of what information is

895
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,589
taking towards what he is talking about

896
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:52,190
I study it a bit and decide that that

897
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,470
stuff there is not a trojan that he got caught

898
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,960
looking at naked women or with the app he

899
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,799
does  le le s  coregge of the pink horns rock

900
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:06,289
is ugly to you but they were crowded ok

901
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:08,450
according to I do the appraisal for my

902
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,430
company there are 3,500 people it

903
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:18,039
happens and who does these things we just

904
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:21,349
ok between a footballer on the iPad of

905
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:26,180
my or my colleague or  there is a

906
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,339
trojan then trash it I understand that

907
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:29,119
someone's

908
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,450
what the [ __ ] if I don't say it the company

909
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:35,289
can fire me to sue

910
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:39,980
me I'm in charge of the office that does

911
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,579
these things I don't know this nobody has

912
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:45,049
yet managed to explain  this

913
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:47,720
thing in the doubt of having to pretend

914
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,099
nothing has happened hoping that no one

915
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:49,609
notices it

916
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:54,170
before I leave but it is not if it is

917
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,180
this with emotion in our opinion

918
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:11,390
so if you unplug the

919
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,999
carabinieri [ __ ] them a you are in a

920
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:30,410
quiet but beautiful place  that then I find a

921
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,390
good-to-know kart finds a sensor

922
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,989
on my device with changed and on my

923
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:38,209
device being curious perhaps specular

924
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:40,729
agreement of something that someone

925
00:42:40,729 --> 00:42:43,430
tells me but 6 for reason I find a

926
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:48,380
sensor on the vas it makes  ccio the studio

927
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,940
I call friends aim to be

928
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,130
observed because this is the hunter

929
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:56,119
not the trojan wine farts horns

930
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:59,359
to whom I say they take it off the jolie I

931
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,400
hack it I cheat it I put a

932
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,259
tape recorder with the voices saying

933
00:43:03,259 --> 00:43:07,209
some [ __ ] things like that  that I

934
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:10,599
should only sell the zero days

935
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:13,400
the other in the put to me so those

936
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,509
zero days are mine

937
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:21,250
in a certain sense 130 gods for iphone

938
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,930
if only fast let's say in the first days

939
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,790
indeed it would probably

940
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,890
also be interesting to create the figure of the

941
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,230
human honey pot  who gets

942
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:35,470
this stuff infected to pour it and then

943
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,180
resell it

944
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,200
or they tell me that fabio at the sensor

945
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,690
even here I pretend nothing has happened I

946
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,580
stop communicating with him continue to lie down

947
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:49,810
with him as before in my case apart from

948
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:53,740
the jokes 50 percent our customers

949
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:57,790
are companies  listed on the stock exchange and therefore

950
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,800
are subject to very

951
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,040
stringent regulations on the dissemination of

952
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,720
information, etc., etc.

953
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,030
if I discover that there is any deal that

954
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,860
could be a master sensor on the

955
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,110
iphone dera of a company

956
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,200
listed on my client this is the

957
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,740
important problem because if it is not of the

958
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,440
valdera of the police force it is of

959
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,330
someone who is perhaps manipulating the

960
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,150
stock market is shorting with derivatives

961
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:30,430
by doing the  money with the information that

962
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:34,180
is taken directly from the ice and if

963
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,580
maybe it is even because my

964
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,140
company is also an

965
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:41,500
auditor those company not me but

966
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,290
someone else goes to jail from the company

967
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:49,720
goes straight to jail well these are the

968
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,480
four scenarios that are not  clear to the

969
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,860
premise that in my opinion all the

970
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:58,090
beautiful ideas that they have poured

971
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,880
into this request for amendments to the

972
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,020
legislation will be impossible to apply

973
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,380


974
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,160
there are those who check the controllers an exam

975
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,990
a common criteria certification of

976
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:13,540
anything costs takes three years and

977
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,030
costs 200 thousand euros 200  thousand euros and these

978
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:20,110
[ __ ] a beta key pays in my opinion it

979
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:23,470
will never work a [ __ ] will happen

980
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,560
to me  an idea and then I stop

981
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,180
and I am definitely not aligned and

982
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,980
therefore obviously I speak exclusively in

983
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,350
my name my idea is that this Rome

984
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,480
should be banned should be

985
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,260
outlawed

986
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:44,980
ok in the sense that there then the weapons of

987
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,690
war

988
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:48,940
if not used as a military are outlawed

989
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,120
in italy if you go around with a

990
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,040
submachine gun in the street they

991
00:45:54,040 --> 00:46:23,260
arrest you cheering an ass so yes but

992
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,030
since there is a problem sorry as

993
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:30,250
there is an attribution problem they use

994
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,580
it the same

995
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:35,980
no they use it there they use it  same but if

996
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,380
I find it I go to make a complaint against

997
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,810
unknown persons saying someone used the stuff

998
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:41,530
of this type

999
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,480
and if it turns out that it was the

1000
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,880
police [ __ ] them

1001
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,500
we look for me and we have to close sorry

1002
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,270
