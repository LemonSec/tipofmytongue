1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
hello everyone today we will talk about kick ass

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,690
before starting a couple of points

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,540
starting with who am I to be

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,620
working paints I am a developer

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,830
small company in Trieste I do not work

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,970
instead I founded a house in

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,789
Trieste called the lab I imagine that all of

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,529
you  have you heard about hack

9
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,349
and slash you already know what they are if not give

10
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,030
me a nod then what an electric circuit is

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,800
before talking about who cad

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,960
which is a tool for developing

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,329
electric circuits already understand well what is

14
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,809
also an electric circuit

15
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,190
this beautiful definition

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,620
taken from the first paragraph of pda in

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,360
my opinion is a bit boring including it to give

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,050
vent to my

19
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,219
physical dan dah part but I like more

20
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,840
a somewhat more functional detention so it is

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,559
a system of interconnected components

22
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,350
that carries out  usually a

23
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,960
certain task so it is

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,900
the equivalent of a software program

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,049
but crystallized into something

26
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,409
physical that you can take in hand like

27
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,799
this

28
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:29,390
talk  we di and dia jedi a serve to

29
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,820
help the designer to develop

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,979
mainly two things

31
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,649
one of these is the wiring diagram the

32
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:39,299
wiring diagram and the one that tells us

33
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,329
how they are logically connected to

34
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,750
each other all the blocks of the circuit

35
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,390
each component is represented by  a

36
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,929
symbol therefore does not give as well as one can

37
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:53,819
see it in the real world in the physical world

38
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,119
but from a symbol that denotes

39
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,970
its role the wiring diagram

40
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,689
answers us a bit to the question which

41
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,500
are the components what I will use and what

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,199
is connected to what then where  where are

43
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,450
the connections how these components interface

44
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:12,840
with

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,349
each other the other part is instead

46
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:19,950
the physical counterpart sky the

47
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,670
printed circuit this here tells us how

48
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,370
the components are arranged how physically they

49
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,200
are connected that is where the

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,109
copper trace passes that connects the various

51
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,650
pins  illustrates the various states of the

52
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,200
circuit if performed in several layers,

53
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,730
usually the ones we see now on

54
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,389
a commercial level are from 8 to 12

55
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:48,389
16 states and da stands for electron design

56
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:51,510
automation and it is essential

57
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,170
nowadays the days are gone when you

58
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,880
could design with the stylus

59
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,060
directly on the printed circuit hate

60
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,139
there are people who still do it

61
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,870
mainly radio amateurs who have

62
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,470
perhaps followed a little  simpler from a

63
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,709
strictly physical point of view

64
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,750
while nowadays only

65
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,610


66
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,750
IT tools are used to assist in the

67
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,470
design how the

68
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,630
workflow of designing in an

69
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,310
electrical diagram works a little to design a printed circuit

70
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:25,849


71
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:28,730
you start the electrical diagram even

72
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,680
before  in truth there is the zero step which

73
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,110
defines what we want to do so

74
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,120
what will be the final result

75
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,970
of this endeavor immediately after we

76
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,650
usually move on to the drawing of the

77
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,590
wiring diagram which obviously tells us on

78
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,030
a logical level how

79
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,430
things will be connected together then c  'is the

80
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,959
protection the design of the

81
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,590
printed circuit then physical realization

82
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,049
dimensions etceter  a etc.

83
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,060
the last step which is the last step only

84
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,420
of what we will talk about today is the

85
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,360
manufacture of the circuit so I have

86
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,019
my files

87
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:07,850
now I have to actually make it

88
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,209
then they know how to use it assembly and various

89
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,410
things where the software can actually help us

90
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,510
because we use the  software and not

91
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,070
the dear old sheet of paper which

92
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,589
is perhaps more intuitive to use the

93
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,289
simple and banal answer more or less

94
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:28,310
everywhere because as human beings we

95
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,190
often forget things in the

96
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,000
let's say part of the schematic drawing the

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,440
main role is precisely the reduction

98
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,240
of errors 15  they are routines and

99
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,780
within all the major ones and from which

100
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,280
they tell us if we have made

101
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,460
connections that are logically

102
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,700
wrong for example I took the output

103
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,110
of a regulator and connected it to the

104
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,030
output of another regulator so

105
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,200
things that conflict  between them

106
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,090
I took an output and linked it to

107
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,010
another output this makes no sense

108
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:03,380
besides this allows us to

109
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,850
reuse  and parts of schematic

110
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,890
ready so as in a kind of

111
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,310
game with legos I have my circuit

112
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,500
that takes care of taking an

113
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,960
arbitrary voltage and generating it five

114
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,730
regular times and I can take it and copy it if

115
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,900
I need it somewhere else in

116
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,040
some other project  they take

117
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,250
pairs directly in the

118
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,110
design phase of the circuit

119
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,560
let's say that it becomes more important it is

120
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,350
precisely this in terms of both

121
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,240
reduction of errors so traces

122
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,380
too close

123
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,270
here we go to interface with

124
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,450
the physical part of the circuit

125
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,360
that is I can not make a circuit

126
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,820
that to the traces more  close to dx millimeters

127
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,740
because otherwise I can't

128
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,020
dissolve the copper with the acid that mixed between the two

129
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,340
tracks so these your tracks

130
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,080
will be connected together with the

131
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,590
following it will not work

132
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,170
overlapping traces but similar similar obvious

133
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,830
reasons in this case instead it does not

134
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,250
only have a function  error reduction

135
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,820
but also an assistance system

136
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,680
for example routing c  i'm in the

137
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,360
routing what is routing i have my

138
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,910
following i put my components

139
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,440
where i like

140
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,940
now i have to see how it

141
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,700
connects them together obviously if i or four layer

142
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,720
2 and layer i can't cross the

143
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,430
tracks because physically if two  tracks

144
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,050
are on the same layer crossed and

145
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,210
are connected together so I have to

146
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,650
find the optimal way to connect

147
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,600
all the pins where they need to be connected

148
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
without obviously having a layer for each

149
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,070
for each track because otherwise it becomes

150
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,850
expensive for this routing systems help us

151
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,220
that can be  automatic or

152
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,820
semi automatic automatic take

153
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,140
project resume project as is

154
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,240
test with a general algorithm of the

155
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,270


156
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,790
tracks connecting all the pins the results of

157
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,280
this of this

158
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,050
unsupervised automatic utri thing

159
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,130
are usually pretty bad

160
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,490
the  algorithm does what it does

161
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,620
but usually automatic counting is not used from the

162
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,920
start, usually

163
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,780
a somewhat hybrid approach is used  that is ugly

164
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,280
first the connections I see that are

165
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,050
more important and then fabric

166
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,580
automatically I put signs on them because

167
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,430
there are some tours that help us

168
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,640
do the manual routing but they help us

169
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,510
for other things

170
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,560
what is the tool called push

171
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,780
pull  router that allows us we will see it

172
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,700
later also at the end there will be a small

173
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,860
demo I will show it to you then exposed the

174
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,210
tracks automatically if I have to

175
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,890
pass a track in a place where there

176
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,300
are other tracks already made I

177
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,740
automatically move all the tracks I can

178
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,710
pass the  my track over is another

179
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,960
thing and also the automatic placement

180
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,890
so respecting the connections that

181
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,630
I have to make between the three various components,

182
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,520
the software can tell me where it is more or less convenient for me to

183
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,690
place the component then to

184
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,970
place made the small theoretical introduction

185
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,840


186
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,330
let's talk about kick  ass chicca is a

187
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,360
software for and has licensed under the

188
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,680
gpl license therefore free open source and cross

189
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,240
platform completely that the space

190
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,030
then linux but  c os windows

191
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,409
maybe some other

192
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:38,230
platform is company to other suites

193
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,200
and to which are always open source but

194
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,120
in my opinion they are of a quality perhaps a little

195
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,700
lower than a g and even if I'm not mistaken

196
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,770
I think it is abandoned at the moment

197
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,590
I do not know if it was yes  they are the cause of pate

198
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,850
like

199
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,600
yes yes well even those who actually fall after

200
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,540
we see it jeffrey thing tasting is a

201
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,700
relatively recent program and has

202
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,339
a somewhat interesting freedom approach

203
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:12,160
all because it allows you to

204
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,540
redesign your circuits with

205
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,660
a brad bird on top  it is a virtual bradford

206
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,720
so it is closer to maybe a track is

207
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,670
one that faces for the first time

208
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,380
with this type of pro with this type

209
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,149
of programs and perhaps a little more intuitive

210
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:30,829
who falls actively developed the last

211
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:32,540
release was just a couple  of

212
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,070
days ago at 4.0.4 among other things he has

213
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,980
characters behind him imposing entities like

214
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,410
cern cerna if I'm not mistaken two

215
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,850
developers who are full time on who

216
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,890
falls also because who comes

217
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,260
also used in the sky

218
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,100
this is a bit of the graphical interface of the

219
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,470
program that draws the

220
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,110
wiring diagram here you can see an example

221
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,079
of a project that was created in a

222
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:05,570
mild lab

223
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,040
we will see it later during the demo a little in

224
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,630
detail this instead is like this  as it

225
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,470
looks

226
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,230
like you see a project of a

227
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,260
printed circuit these st 10

228
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,350
these you see here are components

229
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,399
these four

230
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,040
very small electronic components this card here is

231
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,899
about big

232
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:32,959
so these are also components

233
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,270
these lines verte instead are actual

234
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,140
copper connections

235
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,120
let's see a little

236
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,870
gem respects the unix philosophy in the

237
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,420
sense do one thing will do well

238
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,120
divided into many sub-programs the

239
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,220
main ones are the schematic you need to

240
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,810
draw the schematics that we have

241
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,200
seen of the cpu you need to design and pc

242
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,040
there is then there are many auxiliary tools

243
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,950
more or less auxiliary  in truth gv pcb

244
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,220
that we need to say ok the symbol that

245
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,660
we have seen here this symbol these little

246
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,920
symbols  here they

247
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,600
actually correspond to this component here

248
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,350
says allows you to make this

249
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,150
association is a rather

250
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,150
important thing not all tools

251
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,620
have this imposing to free

252
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,170
let's say unlink the symbol therefore what

253
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,900
logic of my circuit from the actual

254
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,339
implementation because there are

255
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,110
multiple implementations more types  of these

256
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,110
of these circuits that do the same

257
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,770
logic function then there is derby which is

258
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,380
mainly used to inspect

259
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,480
let's say the finished files before sending them

260
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,020
to production and then there is the pcb

261
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,790
calculator which we say couple of

262
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,800
formulas useful when second

263
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,270
drawing pcb  and then there are also a couple

264
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,440
of others that are perhaps a little less

265
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,130
important in the schematic we said strict

266
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,740
designing electrical circuits and has as

267
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,120
its main characteristics the

268
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,780
possibility of making an rc so there are

269
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,910
a couple of check lists that he checks

270
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,110
internally before exporting let's say

271
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,290
the project reports all these

272
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,720
errors to you, therefore all pinks and not  they are

273
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,070
connected tells you look that this

274
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,540
point of having to connect it or

275
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,029
put a particular mark to whoever

276
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,709
tells me this pine no I connect and that's

277
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:40,700
okay pines in conflict things

278
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,260
like this allows me then once he has

279
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,480
drawn my my circuit to export to the

280
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,250
next  the netlist is nothing more than

281
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,170
as from its name the list of to pay tv

282
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,760
p net that is the list of all the

283
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,630
connections between the components

284
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,130
so this allows you to have

285
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,110
the list of components and then

286
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,730
import it into other programs and to do

287
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,080
spies simulations

288
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,650
so I can simulate how

289
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,380
my circuit will behave with another

290
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,870
program schena spies precisely to a

291
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,490
sport a system to export the bomb

292
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,040
so I designed my circuit

293
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,740
now I want to make it I have to buy

294
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,360
all the components I need gen and

295
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,680
you love the list  of components what I

296
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,290
cover and and is to put included so

297
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,850
there is already everything in it but if

298
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,260
a whole set of libraries that allows me to

299
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,360
be able to start g  ià from scratch to make

300
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,130
new pcb circuits instead as

301
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,690
main features to this even

302
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,790
on the router that automatically new

303
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,520
tracks around when I try to bring

304
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,800
another one and it is something that saves let's say it

305
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,210
seems a bit a bit silly

306
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:51,590
thing married saves many many breaks

307
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,450
of arcade boxes the track is making

308
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,280
a cat fine here damn the name

309
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,720
enough space now it does not allow me

310
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,060
to pass still the exposed track

311
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,010
all the others I resume the track which

312
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,300
is something we say is a lot of time

313
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,720
consuming a feature to

314
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,890
equalize lengths

315
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,350
so these two traces must have the

316
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,640
same length

317
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,800
make sure that blue have and then the

318
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,540
generates a kind of zig zag to have

319
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,880
the same length this important

320
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,990
for example when making circuits

321
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,550
for example the ram connections where it is

322
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,810
important that the signal arrives

323
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,880
at the same time

324
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,290
on the other hand and that is inside

325
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,760
a fruit in the of tor so it

326
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,560
allows me to create new compo  nent

327
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,529
new design of components we do a

328
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:46,360
little demo how happy we are then

329
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,310
this is the main screen

330
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,709
this is called project these

331
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,240
buttons allow me to open all the

332
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,660
various tools now I already have one open ok

333
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,510
this this here and the diagrams and here there is  it is

334
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,209
a very simple circuit which is a

335
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:04,720
battery

336
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,970
the resistor is a led diode then

337
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,640
first thing once drew to the

338
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,370
circuit you do this thing here in this

339
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,350
thing here it is called

340
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,690
automatic annotation of the schematic

341
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,240
if you succeed you see all these

342
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,560
question marks will come  replaced now by

343
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,200
numbers consecutive numbers

344
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,959
we are sure here we are this let's say it

345
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:35,220
allows you to keep order

346
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,510
within my schematic when it

347
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,120
becomes complex I know that the numbers start

348
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,820
not in dawn at the top left and go in

349
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,279
lines let's say so I am immediately where to

350
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,220
find a  resistance this is not

351
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,660
necessary I can also

352
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,540
decide myself the numbers I want to mark

353
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,850
the resistances are  an extra

354
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,310
comfort this beautiful ladybug and

355
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:04,060
the electric blues secker I can make it

356
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,250
run should not give me anything

357
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,589
very well so this circuit is fine for him

358
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:10,510
it

359
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,829
must be said that it is also

360
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:14,050
quite important that this this

361
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,990
dear rule cech does not work miracles is not

362
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,029
particularly intelligent if only

363
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:22,320
to avoid

364
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,270
really gross errors ok once

365
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,060
this is done this is to be exported the

366
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,580
netlist this generates the file of

367
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,620
all the with all the connections and

368
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,590
the list of all the components but the

369
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,970
woman does not interest us

370
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,480
ok  now with this button here that you

371
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,470
can see well a symbol of a

372
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,910
schematic in front is the symbol of a

373
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,120
footprint a schematic symbol behind

374
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,100
a symbol of out of three in front

375
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,960
allows me to ok allows me to associate

376
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,690
the two the two things then the  the symbol

377
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,190
with the physical realization is

378
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,349
now telling me why whoever falls

379
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,260
just installed on this computer that

380
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,329
cv pcb and is starting for the first time

381
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,109
and  so i have to download the libraries

382
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,790
this is an absolutely normal thing

383
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:22,709
i hope if the fast wi fi connection

384
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:27,780
has already set up ok then here you can

385
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,140
see marcella already here you can see

386
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,100
here are my components and here here the

387
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,070
name of the schematic then bt1 and  here

388
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,990
the name of the footprint so he already knows

389
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,360
that these here eh a battery that in

390
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,320
this shape here now we have with

391
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,990
this button I can filter all

392
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,810
the tv brands that are here for example but

393
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,570
I choose one at random I can see how it

394
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,500
looks

395
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,420
here is this here is  what will be

396
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,610
drawn if you select it

397
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,920
this will be drawn on the pcb

398
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,150
these reddish parts are

399
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,010
actually copper what will be

400
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,570
drawn on the copper while these are the

401
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,580
ones that will be drawn with a

402
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,860
non-conductive ink the right

403
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,010
normal but this is not what interests me

404
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,550


405
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:24,200
let's see ok there are already

406
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:47,180
how many you need to do the neckline yes no ok

407
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:56,720
then this no described cm to me you

408
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,290
have nothing to

409
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:10,360
do with it you have to do  with a lot of patience maybe

410
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,340
I can show it directly so no

411
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,030
while there is no day library on

412
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,650
this computer

413
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,260
oh well it is not important let's give another ok

414
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,660
this one is a little more familiar this

415
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,280
here is the classic led design that if

416
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,240
someone had seen  a

417
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,850
printed circuit their seen certainly

418
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,370
this one here as I said is copper so

419
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,100
this these two forms are the

420
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,140
ones that will then be made in

421
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,830
copper while this is the ink this

422
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,430
yellow text usually is not written

423
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,910
ok

424
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,990
this is a resistance this

425
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,400
a '  special assistance is a

426
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,770
surface mount resistor

427
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,730
08 05 which is also the little room

428
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:18,900
ok made this except who I give it up here

429
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,530
save also and now I will have pcb new with

430
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,740
this button here yes there is no pc

431
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,830
I want to create it now I have to read the

432
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,090
netlist with  this button here

433
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,750
he opens this window that

434
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,170
allows you to read a generated netlist

435
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,400
if everything is okay everything is fine

436
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,150
I care t  all the components

437
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,400
here I will now use the

438
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,810
keyboard software but this we say

439
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,270
by pressing m I can move my

440
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,840
footprints around as you can see there is

441
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,920
a thread a white thread I don't know if

442
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,400
it shows yes this let's say it helps me to

443
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,990
see

444
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,160
what the  components that must

445
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,400
be close to each other

446
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,500
ok and this is called

447
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,909
the east race then arrived here

448
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:24,250
I know that since this white thread

449
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,450
I have to connect these two things together I

450
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,690


451
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,380
add a track key card very

452
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,020
nicely it highlights the tracks

453
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,409
that must connect step  this way if

454
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:42,070
I don't know if you notice but there are two thin

455
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,470
strips above and below the main track

456
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,580


457
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,770
I don't know if you see those are the

458
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,770
limits that is from my rules

459
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,110
no track can get closer than

460
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,510
those in those two lines if it does not

461
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,210
violate them  dlc rules arrived

462
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:08,940
here but apart from that i

463
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,070
'm myself

464
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,419
a small screen to do these things

465
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:36,799
it takes a rather large screen

466
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,140
otherwise not seen  the whole toolbar and

467
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,820
in fact when I was still all the

468
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:50,860
way I will be so maybe ok

469
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:58,859
well now I made my connection

470
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:01,169
very nice gem also writes me

471
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:04,049
the name of the net along the

472
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,789
pads so I know that it connected together

473
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:10,249
ok

474
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:17,759
arrived at this point  I can make a

475
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,379
plot then export in

476
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:23,580
this format this standard format which is called

477
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,269
gherber format all my layers

478
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:30,089
once this is done created them

479
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:31,320


480
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,119
and these files are ready to be

481
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,129
sent to the fabrication

482
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:42,529
so I can see with guard view

483
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:48,539
I don't have  selected right layer ok

484
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:52,969
you see this is only the copper part

485
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:55,679
this is a pin of the and other pin

486
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,329
of the led and of the resistance on foot non-

487
00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:02,549
existence if you take another these

488
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:02,849
things

489
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:05,969
this time no what is

490
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:08,429
these here are only the writings and  this

491
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:13,219
is the writing of the resistance has

492
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,809
improved because on the other side of

493
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:18,469
the circuit found

494
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:24,059
if I take the yes here instead there is the yes

495
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,429
sting of the head this q  his layer

496
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:28,619
where where the writings are made with

497
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:31,700
these ink is called silk screen

498
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:37,729
ok well

499
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:46,040
this is how much this concludes

500
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,950
this little demos and if you want you can

501
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,890
make me tap tap on the shoulder where I will be

502
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,420
around for her that for all the

503
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,040
duration and I do you  see things a little more

504
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,580
complex than this maybe if there are

505
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,920
questions but we still think some

506
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,040
time

507
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,030
as usual not all together please

508
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:17,870
someone will come I don't work el

509
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,360
interfacing with others probably

510
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:27,160
use then disclaimer

511
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,180
I don't use gem from work use gem

512
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,430
from mit e  b but I work or I don't use

513
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,320
gem then to interface with

514
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,760
other people we usually use either the pdf

515
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,910
of the schematic or the gerber files

516
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,850
of the pcb therefore interoperability

517
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,380
usually if you don't have to actually

518
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,080
collaborate and make the circuit together

519
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,620
with another company  usually you do not

520
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,330
tend to have problems with file types it must

521
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,140


522
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,940
also be said that in the world a

523
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,920
professional industrialist alas is used

524
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,070
mainly  pally high is a package that

525
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:08,300
costs an arm and a leg got a

526
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,810


527
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,770
hundred and didn't feel done

528
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,170


529
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,820


530
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,970


531
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,550


532
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:36,170
the needs of nobility

533
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:41,240
were not enough done it reaches 80 80 90

534
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,910
in essence you have most of the

535
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,850
tools being open source therefore

536
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,220
very popular among the maker environment

537
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,460
you also find many ready-made libraries there

538
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,240
are a series of projects that if

539
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,900
we say you take  care to organize

540
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,309
these books of even one of these

541
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:05,300
circuit ab so you find bulls a lot of

542
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,800
work ready to disclaimer

543
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,179
this alfalfa for a couple of weeks has

544
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:19,160
arrived in the veil of gem the feature

545
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,140
of being able to simulate directly so

546
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,970
we will soon have a simulator

547
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:27,110
integrated in the  directly in the

548
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,929
schematic editor then in the diagram

549
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:31,610
so in my opinion I used it as a

550
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,410
hobbyist and I have not found it

551
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,530
but  I found it enough 34 first

552
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:42,200
the best uses I say yes because you can

553
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,120
make the boards as big as you want you can

554
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,500
do

555
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:55,280
sic yes but we will say it feels

556
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,940
I said that a fairly

557
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,450
well-known product in the world that has two

558
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:07,100
design books of the mini  pc of

559
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,660
Mr. bot accomplished and other circuits

560
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,570
now use kick light ecomat olivo

561
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,810
are then the files what was

562
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,810
written was that then if one wants to

563
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,880
open their project that is what you can

564
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,530
then buy as a printed box sorry to

565
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,360
put the microphone a little more  to the east

566
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,720
at the top because there are 96 and that's

567
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,130
what they wrote and then you don't

568
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,750
see anything because there is no list of

569
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,480
components and these components the list

570
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,390
of their components as they really have it then

571
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,350
the bot

572
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,560
the design has it  created also

573
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,320
released I can digital so my

574
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,370
question is how it will go at the general level

575
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,580
of the components are managed if a

576
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,650
certain company uses certain components for

577
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,010
them bonn and I who maybe want to see

578
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,380
if m  ai a bot

579
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,690
that is the drawing of a boss that I took

580
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,430
what can I do and then have everything ready

581
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:19,280
eventually I do not know if in a

582
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,150
kick ass release it

583
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,980
would be necessary to include these

584
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,960
component libraries of a certain

585
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,590
manufacturer then the question essentially

586
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,320
was if I  I make my board with my

587
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,410
footprints with my symbols and I

588
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,470
publish them as comelico or I don't publish them

589
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,450
as someone else can see the

590
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,820
symbols since there is no library I

591
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,210
understood well

592
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,540
ok then gem from a mechanism

593
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,950
called  library cash therefore by default

594
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,800
all symbols and all footprints

595
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,180
that are used within a

596
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,250
project are copied

597
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,810
within this library cash

598
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,780
this cash library, however, being a file

599
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,610
generated many times, it is ignored by

600
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,150
geeks

601
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,010
that is, many times the developers

602
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:13,360
ignore but because it is a duplicate thing

603
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,920
so maybe many times in the

604
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,950
distributions there is not added

605
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,780
to the abb talks

606
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,550
in truth key card supports the

607
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,200
d libraries  and the footprint then the physical part the

608
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,500
physical description of the component

609
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,670
downloadable directly from geeks certain

610
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,770
limits of rl and he downloads it and

611
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:37,250
imports it as much as possible but I don't know if that is

612
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,770
expected to be alive because if I have the

613
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,770
kick ass debian package

614
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,770
I would not want to  download of the thing

615
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:49,700
outside the debian package of course yes but

616
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,610
unfortunately these

617
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,760
packages being many that there are many

618
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,130
varied of various forms of various it is

619
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,230
a bit difficult to include them all it would

620
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,470
also be let's say who falls with his

621
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,780
usual batteries included so that is

622
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,430
all  the basic components are and all

623
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,960
the basic components all basic footprints

624
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,030
are already included some of the

625
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:15,130
vendors too so to the texas chips i

626
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:20,030
will bring g that of the st i don't know

627
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,540
so the basic things there are

628
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,010
anything of that anything

629
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,770
extra yours  mign and right now you have to

630
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:31,760
download the parent distributions

631
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,000
then the extra libraries you could

632
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,500
make a package for each library p  but

633
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:43,430
maybe it would be a bit one per kill a

634
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:50,330
packet yes it could be done

635
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,800
but you have to decide what to put

636
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:57,940
in it some packets have been inverted

637
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:03,220
in truth it

638
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,230
would be enough to simply form a

639
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,110
group of people who let's say are

640
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,730
dedicated to maintaining a series of

641
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,950
extra libraries that do not  they are present

642
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,600
in the libraries chords gems because

643
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,409
maybe we don't care is to make

644
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:19,179
a package they will make of lisa it is quite

645
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:20,440
easy in short, once you have it

646
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,470
undergone cup then also pay it and

647
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,139
download it inside a plan package as

648
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:27,759
well insert it directly with the morale

649
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,230
from  who cup,

650
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,330
however, you have to find someone who will

651
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:36,779
ask you

652
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,760
other questions other questions you will find me later maybe we will make

653
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,350
a small group thanks
