1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
i am matteo i am part of the long of

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,750
venice

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,339
he and francesco and he too is

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,039
part of the venice logo

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,110
what are we talking about what is

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,139
the alternation school work what is it

7
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:16,830
then the reform was born from the

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,000
moratti law number 107 15  of article 1

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,680
which inserts the obligation to

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,429
high school and the three-year period

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,949
precisely starting from those of this

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,550
last year who have to do

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,920
about 200 hours

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,129
alternating with the world of work of things

15
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,910
that can talk can talk about

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,480
professional courses or  be

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,500
included in

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,930
Italian companies to experience

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,010
what is the biggest problem of

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,619
filling the training gap between what

21
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,380
is the academic world and what is the

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,009
world of work

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,120
they can have both experience in the

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,560
field and training  in the classroom and

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,770
professional or in particular courses

26
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,680
held within their

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,170
own institution

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,940
what is the problem the biggest

29
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,740
problem they have found in this  I am

30
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,500
moment is that this law is applicable

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,330
to all high schools from the

32
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,670
third of last year so third

33
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,820
quarters the fourth this year the thirds of the

34
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,290
teacher this year that will arrive

35
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,480
so you can imagine the number of

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,250
boys that they find themselves having to

37
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,800
manage outside the hours

38
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,200
of destruction degrees these hours are 200

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,840
distributed in three years and

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,909
practically

41
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,270
all the boys have to do them all the boys

42
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,970
you can imagine all the institutes

43
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,949
only in Venice really have an

44
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,840
avalanche but since it is an Italian law

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,640
all the institutes  in all of Italy they

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,470
must are obliged to do this thing

47
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,989
how it was born what happened to us it

48
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:25,160
happened that a professor from the

49
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,069
zuccante institute called us saying that

50
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:31,500
he intended to start a project

51
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,459
with us to be able to make the children understand

52
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:42,720
that there is not only  let's say

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,819
fixed work but there is also the possibility

54
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,579
through open source to create one

55
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,110
's own activities and

56
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,359
possibilities  career development and

57
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:54,989
so on

58
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:56,970
what happened we went to talk

59
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,530
to the professors of this institute and

60
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,000
they explained to us what their

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,799
needs were what we started

62
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,590
we put together a little while talking about it

63
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,430
and

64
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,469
we started to say very

65
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:14,290
well  recipients the net

66
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,799
slabs are all technical institutes

67
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,609
preferably because it is not that

68
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:21,579
we can speak with I don't know with other

69
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:25,030
particular institutes to try to

70
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,620
give them what our subjects are

71
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,250
those computer subjects and give them

72
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,189
ideas of what they can do what they

73
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:37,180
cannot do is  intended for all

74
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,370
students who participate in the

75
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:45,639
school-work terrace of the three-year period therefore in addition

76
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,909
to the institutes we need to

77
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:50,230
involve all the

78
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,629
various associations in the area that

79
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,909
promote this open source

80
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:56,669
so we are certainly

81
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,319
an association that does this however

82
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,510
nothing excludes us from being able to ask for

83
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,040
help from the a club the others the others

84
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,629
l  places in the area and so on

85
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:09,219
also because we are able to

86
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,200
cover maybe some institutes here

87
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,569
in the city of venice but we are

88
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,549
certainly not able to cover all the

89
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:17,349
institutes throughout Italy

90
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:19,000
so we have also had interests

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,370
from some long of verona some

92
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,770
looks  outside etc.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,840
ok what are the topics

94
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,210
then what have we done we have

95
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,010
prepared a whole series of topics and

96
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,170
in agreement with the various organizers of

97
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,240
these topics and we will go to the

98
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,000
institutes that we will create conferences

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,880
to be able to explain what are what are

100
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,190
jobs and what are not done  it is said

101
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,390
that the topics that we have

102
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,000
established are the official ones in the

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,310
sense that if because now there is someone

104
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,140
who has some topic that can be

105
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,280
part of these types of talks of these

106
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,130
types of instructions the courses can

107
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,230
be integrated into

108
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,419
what they are  the times are very

109
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,880
variable depending on how we want to

110
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,480
talk to the guys as we

111
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,000
compare ourselves with  we involve them

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
during that time of the talk then what

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,010
are the paths nice basic topic of

114
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,710
everything will necessarily be all open source and

115
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,020
the topic will talk about what is open

116
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,060
source what is free software to

117
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,650
try to distinguish

118
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,900
these two for a moment  words that very often

119
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,040
get mixed up a bit when they

120
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,150
have a completely different meaning

121
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,659


122
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,010
according to the other topics we have

123
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,020
foreseen a whole series of different topics

124
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,330


125
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,550
we have defined a number of

126
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,490
those various topics can

127
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,220
be topic 1 let's talk about the

128
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,750
cloud topic 2 could  it could be

129
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,870
programming 3 could be about seo

130
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,860
and communication 4 could be

131
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,650
yacht and internet of internet of

132
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,800
things the fifth topic could

133
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,650
be security the sixth could be

134
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,120
systems engineer

135
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,530
set design and web designer of me and where he

136
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,080
lived asked for something not  i had seen

137

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,260
friends who talked to each other only

173
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,800
about open source linux then we began to

174
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,440
find each other physically in some

175
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,270
buildings that they had made

176
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,880
available to us after which we had

177
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,280
problems for the availability of these

178
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,630
buildings

179
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,010
there  we have decided to become an

180
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,940
association in 2007 in 2007 we have

181
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,810
become an association for the reason of an

182
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,900
interview with the institutions with the

183
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,630
municipality, etc.

184
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,940


185
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,320


186
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,910


187
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,630


188
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,550
went to talk to the institutions and

189
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,680
after a couple of years they also granted us

190
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,740
a free sniff room where

191
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,310
we hold a whole series of talks and

192
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,760
the low cost courses short

193
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,390
means we are talking about 5 euros 10 euros a

194
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,560
