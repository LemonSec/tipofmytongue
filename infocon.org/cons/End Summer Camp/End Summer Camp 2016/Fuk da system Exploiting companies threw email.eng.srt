1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,689
good evening guys we are merit is no

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,319
we are two members of the class today of

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,219

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,700
company on the e-mail that is how to go and

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,900
get targets set according to

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,279
certain standards that we have

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,949
set ourselves and see if by chance the

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,779
companies respond in the companies

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,050
respond  or by clicking on the link that

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,480
we sent him my media mails in

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,940
this case all the examples that he

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,620
will show will be emails sent to

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,160
different types of companies to which

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,930
he sent a link and of course not

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,390
malicious so we have not done any

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,370
kind of damage not  we injected

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,449
nothing but many interesting things came out

18
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,460
that we are going to

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,280
illustrate during the talk bari had

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,600
more category let's

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,030
start with the tourist

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,549
hotel one because because what is

23
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,250
fun you can do many things and

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,130
it grinds a lot of interesting stuff

25
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,420
hotels then mainly the

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,159
target  of the hotels I tried not

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,460
to for 12 star hotels  because at

28
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,840
work in the hotel so i know how

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,090
renault works from the sailing ship those of

30
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,659
12 stars are more for shakespeare to

31
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,500
reveal the answer they do not respond

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,299
as of 4 5 stars more than

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,700
hotel prestige the more maybe it is paid by the

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,040
employee and the more they respond he will greet

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,770
mail on  write to me they answer immediately it

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,110
could be that they ask if you are happy

37
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,210
ready if they answer after five days

38
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,939
you have lost a customer

39
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:52,200
then the idea was bomb I

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,110
will start a customer a hotelier

41
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,369
applications e mail

42
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:59,810
how can I do it yesterday hotels

43
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,360
when there are trivial reservations or

44
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,360
directly or mainly with the

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,040
online travel agencies that can be

46
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,038
booking challenges and company varies when they

47
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:12,130
pass through the rio tr

48
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,770
pia they pay the commission that varies from

49
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,220
18 and now also 21 up to 51 52

50
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,880
percent depends on the structure

51
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,680
obviously if one tried  directly

52
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,030
from the hotel agrees to the structure

53
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,390
so it does not pay the commission and the

54
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,650
main slat was good morning I know  no a

55
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,410
guy caio and I saw this offer star

56
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,380
mega offer on this site here and if

57
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,780
tried directly by you

58
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,549
in fact please the same price

59
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:45,230
and here you see beautiful lake for the canvas

60
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,420
directly from phone ripa its

61
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,090
price so immediately a moment only to  bam

62
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,150
bam bam the first hotel after 4 minutes

63
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,970
I had two one answer two clicks

64
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,790
I got no one else it was played and I

65
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,340
took the email I sent it from 34 others to

66
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,500
always give it 4 5 stars and

67
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,470
everyone clicked on it within 24  hours

68
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,530
a small clarification is that they

69
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,630
clicked after 4 minutes and after 4

70
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,980
minutes we went to see the log for the

71
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,160
web server on which the

72
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,680
link was magically pointing to the link

73
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,260
that ip address that goes now click

74
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,319
exactly a range of pd that  of that

75
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,079
hotel so already from this information

76
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,359
we had the whole subnet all the

77
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:33,079
public half of the hotel in question is

78
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,850
the same thing has happened for all the

79
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,870
cases that we are going to list one thing

80
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,170
to send an email is  much easier to

81
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,470
send it to the mail with an attachment and make them

82
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,510
begin to forget that with a link

83
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,819
because there will be a video there will be

84
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:52,750
android 90 it will be one thing is spam

85
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,069
however the regatta did not stop they

86
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,750
look at it what works or works then it

87
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,519
depends 7 how good they were

88
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:00,920
surely in this case here it took

89
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,329
me a little longer to write it three

90
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,530
minutes

91
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,209
and it worked right away this is the

92
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,770
second email sent bobbin pia coppa

93
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,880
articulated only changed the url 3a 4a and

94
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,760
then I stopped and I understood what

95
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,800
message arrived on  with attachments read

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,160
right we wanted to see if the

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,050
largest Italian or European

98
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,790
supermarkets with you too nature here and there

99
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,820
they too are arable then and on the

100
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,620
markets what they do they sell less what

101
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,400
products foods and if the food is poor

102
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,480
some on the markets  they go more on the

103
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,270
quality they breed than on the on the price

104
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,800
for the cheaper price fourth or

105
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,140
lower but in the sound bit to afford it was

106
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,780
revered proof expired because if one

107
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,310
knows the skin  absolute value between image currency

108
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,280
and then our application prelli then the

109
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,780
main thing safe katia is the food

110
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,090
the quality of the food used bombs how

111
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,860
can I do how can I convince

112
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,380
a user from above on the market to

113
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,419
click on the link I have

114
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:08,240
easy mandate there is the exhibition to the blue

115
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,020

116
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,000
every face his house and my person bones

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,720
mass scenes what that of what has

118
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,590
arrived made betray the caprese and

119
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,479
host there was the part of the exhibition

120
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,850
from the  blue no problem I

121
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,039
threw it away already warned guys but in

122
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,520
any case the straw mark it up immediately

123
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,390
immediately a click

124
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,100
since we are talking about five tenths

125
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,570
lazio I got it touched cabbage you are so

126
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,669
if it works so well let's try on all

127
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:44,070
the others that I took a  a little a little

128
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,310
bigger smaller it is only one that

129
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,710
the international one has answered

130
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,750
thank you we see some

131
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,010
facts that some more information

132
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,630
others among well known clicked ok

133
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,400
does not work  and doctor

134
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,370
and precisely thanks to all these emails

135
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,860
sent and above all the most

136
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,630
important thing to take into consideration

137
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,280
that everything was targeted so

138
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,680
the aunt was analyzed the company that

139
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,479
the interlocutor to those of those

140
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,620
with whom you were going to talk

141
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,759
most of the spam

142
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,130
phishing social engineering emails that are

143
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,639
sent are robotic they take a

144
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,940
text they translate it they throw it in the country

145
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,169
in which they want to infect and

146
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:39,880
more or less intelligent people manage to

147
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,530
realize that this is an

148
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,020
attack attempt while sending emails like

149
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,979


150
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:48,330
during this test we did this test of 20 companies

151
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,400
and by analyzing the company the

152
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,139
type of sector the type of

153
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:55,419
activity it performs and above all

154
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:56,979
by analyzing the

155
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,560
direct person concerned direct person is

156
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,270
much much much easier to be able

157
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,210
to trust the l  'user who is

158
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,240
reading the emails and then make them click

159
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,130
a link rather than just making

160
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,449
an alle

161
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:15,190
Therefore, given this this methodology

162
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,000
is the classic goal the most

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,419
used method by those who really want to

164
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,620
re-enter a company or

165
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,389
simply get information

166
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:27,699
about a company from that

167
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,150
fundamental thing is to analyze the target and

168
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,840
not throw the lures everywhere and

169
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,940
wait  that someone will take the bait here in

170
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,979
any case on all the examples we

171
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:40,419
have done we have taken 20

172
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,740
companies he told me let's see if we can

173
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,889
do it on twenty companies one

174
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,099
hundred percent of target responses so it

175
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:51,760
means that the email we sent and

176
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,889
each apple was

177
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,300
different apart from the first of the hotels and which

178
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:02,349
were copied and pasted

179
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,720
for 100 percent of customers in the

180
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,449
email we sent 100 percent of

181
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:08,530
users who read the email

182
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,710
clicked and then from there we went

183
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,350
managed to trace a

184
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,700
lot of information so from the browser

185
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,550
that use the operating system is the

186
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,590
most interesting thing is the

187
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,440
ip address because from  ip address from belgium

188
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,200
maybe in a year a class purchased

189
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,370
and they use an alice adsl line or

190
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,830
blocks for it however a little

191
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:39,580
bigger companies have a public range and on

192
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,049
that public range then of course

193
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,150
we have done many have done some

194
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,600
small analyzes and there are many

195
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,360
information from an ftp server with

196
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,140
anonymous

197
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,680
I still an anonymous user and they

198
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,240
use that server for what to

199
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,500
exchange information with customers

200
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,160
but unfortunately they forget to

201
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,440
delete the data that the data are

202
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:09,340
public levante 2 computer science and here a

203
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,500
clarification the owner

204
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,450
of the company  in question and for example

205
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:19,930
in the room then this was the most

206
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,940
difficult because I say how the hell can

207
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,660
I convince a nerd to click on a

208
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,990
club link and I understand the beautiful girl

209
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,230
who wants heat you know maybe 1 16 you

210
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,510
click but one who knows  that at the work

211
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,270
that the work program does I will do balice

212
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,890
comes Stalinist but the quad ico bocchi

213
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,940
hunts the cowboys and or she nevertheless

214
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,610
q  his company in particular mine is

215
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,200
very close to my heart

216
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,900
in his studio he made good videnzia

217
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,000
the air take he went up according to the site

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,240
where he was other hosted sites and see

219
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,400
if maybe there is a power by to the company

220
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,250
from the good and from there he can  send an email from

221
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,250
even if they tell us or test a moment

222
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,220
surely it will not work

223
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,650


224
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,210


225
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,930


226
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,880


227
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,710


228
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,050
years and the one in three

229
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,880
months

230
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,250
including the lip the most beautiful new

231
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,600
employees 15 and 16 months I saw that

232
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,470
the vat linkedin

233
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,230
I saw that one of the two boys had a

234
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,720
VAT number it will not be the company I

235
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,930
don't know what web development is good for us to

236
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,620
say  the site i go to the site and not there if

237
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,780
there is no absence in the contacts

238
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,840
wait a moment he works for

239
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,630
this company here he does

240
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,920
small jobs but does not want to be contacted

241
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,720
because I do not know why I work for the first

242
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,030
company no the solution could be

243
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,670
maybe maybe maybe some friends who in the

244
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,170
meantime pass them some work and

245
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,660
contact advice i was dancing then there is the

246
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:13,770
apple it was hello i'm antonio or a

247
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,030
medical site recommended the bear to me to

248
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,630
freshen up a bit of  facelift to the site

249
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,670
I have already some ideas already I could

250
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,200
feel to check the site and

251
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,390
maybe we enter a beer ct we

252
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,710
talk about it then we agree well

253
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,840
initially no answer and I say

254
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,480
cabbage one day two days three days 4

255
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,380
5 days and  on the sixth pagan day he was on

256
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:47,350
vacation I stopped I did not do anything

257
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,980
36 days because he was waiting for the answer

258
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,840
but it went very very very well very

259
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,840
well I would say that it is piran laws

260
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,640
those of the controlled companies

261
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,580
this instead means this is

262
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,080
another beautiful company that  produces

263
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,520
hardware software worldwide

264
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,660
when we were unable to send e-

265
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,880
mails because we did not know directly

266
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,160
who to reach in order to have

267
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,220
certain infs  ormazioni then we

268
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,770
entered the company website telling him

269
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,880
about we have a friend who

270
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,590
bought this banana computer is

271
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,400
beautiful and is part of the banana wear models

272
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,610


273
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,620
I would like to know if this model is

274
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,010
really for sale if there is how much it

275
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,330
costs me and what I could do with the model

276
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,960
that I saw comes from this site and

277
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:55,110
they answered yes it is a banana web

278
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,310
twenty initially written a little badly

279
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,070
because you know I don't know it will be necessary but not by such

280
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,960
a hand then exactly

281
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,330
at the beginning we wrote banana

282
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,510
wave so as to

283
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,160
make believe that he  we are really

284
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,510
interested in the article but we do not

285
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,630
know it and therefore the user the

286
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,270
person clicked on this link and we

287
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,820
immediately interrupted the communication and

288
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,090
to avoid going further and even here

289
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,870
we were able to trace the

290
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,360
ip class of the of whom  banana produces were

291
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,380
here we can't say the names of companies

292
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:40,320
because we are in public but I go yes

293
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,320
yes yes to the orange after 1 dec where he no

294
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,680
longer has imagination or  it will be necessary but guys who

295
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,300
because now you go

296
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,100
the message has arrived that of the

297
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,910
method said one thing at random is my friend

298
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,260

in those jewels fas col del fai one of the

300
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,300
dealership I say well let's do it

301
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,730
took I took a she a big car  with

302
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,440
system he understands and around the veneto

303
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,580
and I look at vardo var where like ebay for the

304
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,220
beautiful from all so the sales machines

305
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,770
with prices an idea wrobel kind both

306
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,690
used and new machines covered mo

307
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,740
what we do

308
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,620
that car interests me and there me

309
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,010
it did not seem of that time you fly mail

310
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,290
good morning in mind system that but here

311
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,660
only those who make a first weapon but is still

312
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,290
available

313
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,870
obviously there is the photo there is the link where

314
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,370
exactly where to be on the page

315
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,180
is already here but if I come there  I am

316
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,950
interested in the macro and they have to think about

317
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,660
selling the machine but if the language of

318
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,090
in advance how do you want to block us it puts

319
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,060
the bit in difficulty a bit of tension and

320
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,740
these in for a quarter of an hour you remind me

321
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,750
tr  to the distrust well where the way of

322
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,750
rock is also here of the machines

323
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,170
obtained very well I have not tried on the

324
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,550
others who now do so without

325
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,010
looking for wrobel jar because by now the targets

326
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,930
were winning per cent on the emails sent

327
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,040
so what the [ __ ] do we do

328
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:16,000
no no  no no the link we

329
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,160
have it we have it we deliberately hidden it from you

330
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,939
because there was information above that it

331
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:24,670
was better not to know that in

332
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,199
case there was an ugly person in the

333
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:28,209
middle he could break the bales

334
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:32,439
heavily because it is not  its legal to

335
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:36,060
do this type of newspaper activity

336
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,060


337
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,689
here too since lately we

338
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:46,120
are seeing a lot of

339
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,370
videos of people filming a

340
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,610
fight rather than a Bengali who

341
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,720
does damage or someone who tries to make

342
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,730
problems around the cities  we

343
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,069
said but why do we send an email

344
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:01,990
saying heck we saw a fight

345
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,319
between tunisians and bengali bengali

346
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:07,139
bengali tunisian in the mestre area

347
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,970
sent to hicks  newspapers or a newspaper

348
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,370
what I have filmed the whole scene the

349
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,449
veil uploaded online

350
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:16,059
just as if I were a user who or the

351
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,100
video and I want to become famous

352
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,139
turns I want my name written

353
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:22,689
somewhere I send it to you newspaper

354
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,029
then from the newspaper you  trust because you believe

355
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:28,240
that this is this video is real

356
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,339
so the links you see you click it

357
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:32,500
because you want to see attention there is a on

358
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,519
the newspaper website

359
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,069
you have a video something to point out the

360
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:42,730
boundaries of the road and here too we

361
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,240
naturally have links as I repeat to you  that

362
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,129
we did not do any kind of

363
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:50,290
illegal activity simply sent a link

364
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,529
with the server name slash 0 slash one

365
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:55,839
slate two right and we knew that it was that

366
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,500
mail was sent to link 123 and we knew

367
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,320
when it was then

368
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,290
that creating a short reply to when

369
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,270
someone had clicked  on the

370
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:12,810
transport link and also this fantastic e-mail

371
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:16,250
here we talk about

372
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,800
possible transport there is no rental

373
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,280
but let's say transport on a vaporetto  it

374
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,920
is not known where the jersey part in the world may

375
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:32,880
be in olbia and here too we naturally wanted to

376
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,310
receive basic information in

377
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,640
order to understand if it was possible to

378
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,790
receive the necessary data to be able to

379
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,310
start a penetration

380
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,750
testing activity rather than social engineering

381
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,650
this fantastic e-mail that

382
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,120
of course he wrote about because I

383
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,360
deserve to write e-mails it is a marvel

384
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,430
yesterday the day we were on the

385
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,910
vaporetto your sailor has seen

386
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,530
fit to harass my sister both

387
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,310
verbally and by touching bad rain in the ass

388
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:09,420
but graziano if you

389
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,480
ask this information it is the company

390
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,470
that directs the management  of the vaporettos and

391
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,020
I made the video today a guy

392
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,800
put it on youtube and you send him this link

393
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:27,409
london nino they clicked on 16 tv

394
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,380
before before they opened links if they

395
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,740
passed it between colleagues they did not want to

396
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,790
see their ass palpated and also  that

397
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,280
result was more than one hundred

398
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,000
percent because it was 16 out of 11 and mails

399
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,910
sent 16 if clickers then  you want after

400
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:57,660
2 am we will deliver the logs nice video

401
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,440
if you do it

402
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,850
I will touch your ass and then

403
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,770
never anything this repeated this

404
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,450
is the last one we did and I wanted to

405
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,040
send it back another company always very

406
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,440
similar in the Olbia area  of olbia

407
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,700
copied and pasted just called the

408
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,010
link and even there almost immediately the dante

409
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,270
dante dante so much so much it

410
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:34,240
works enough enough questions behind

411
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,530
limpia there is an engine hicks with v point

412
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:42,580
cases maxi puntoit slash 12345 is an

413
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,299
empty page

414
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:46,179
there is therefore  you reply a 404 but

415
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:54,370
modified yes we the analysis we

416
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,179
the analysis we did does not want to

417
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:02,770
eat a black microphone it is not a

418
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,840
cilum we have done the analysis we

419
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,600
send we send the emails to this company

420
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,990
with the link and slash gounod us  in the log

421
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,290
we checked if slash puno

422
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,960
clicked, that is, if

423
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,740
there was a 404 in the log www.un.org because

424
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,809
in that case it was sending an error page it

425
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,120
says contact the web master or

426
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,700
what we had written I can't remember  rdo

427
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,490
I think we will check the I will show you web

428
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,120
server after

429
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,610
as I repeat all all have

430
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,100
clicked is the most important thing to

431
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,860
understand that if you want if you want if you

432
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,990
want to do social engineering activities it

433
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,929
is essential to

434
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:56,090
first analyze the type of the type of

435
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,440
target therefore if a company

436
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,700
analyze what that company does the

437
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,200
employees of that company

438
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,809
if a private person analyze what

439
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:07,910
his passions are because we have done

440
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,130
another activity that we

441
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,600
have not yet published that aims

442
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,200
at individuals  people

443
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,200
publish curriculums online they

444
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,140
have a linkedin account and have a variety of

445
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,169
information among which there is obi

446
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:30,880
riding a fundamental

447
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,200
information essential information to be able to

448
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,570
interact directly with that

449
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,669
person by giving him trust between you and therefore

450
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:40,700
become a trust and to yours  time then

451
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,429
send an email saying hello hello

452
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:45,710
I'm going on horseback and I'm fine I'm

453
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,600
tracking  and to whom I saw that you go to the

454
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,400
easel the pub alone I am a friend of

455
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,679
gino that my goals to contact you for

456
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:57,610
hicks things

457
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,880
other

458
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,600
questions apart from the monkeys and other people since

459
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,070
you do the [ __ ] to face the spray

460
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,590
too where the group of  control

461
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,179
excuse me the control group that is

462
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:17,780
you said that it is imperative to

463
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,919
make

464
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:22,039
the emails on purpose for the exact individual user

465
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,980
where is my control group

466
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,960
of those to whom you sent an email that

467
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,609
had nothing to do with seeing if they

468
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:31,639
clicked on it  or not there is no

469
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:33,759
control group because our aim was to

470
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:38,179
send an email to a company this

471
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:41,029
company will never click on this email

472
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,950
but it would also be interesting to know

473
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,389
if they would also click on a

474
00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:47,169
[ __ ] link on a less well done one

475
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:51,980
yes okay it can stay there we did not do

476
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,809
any kind of check the

477
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:55,759
check was done by

478
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,489
looking at the logs on the web server where he

479
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:01,129
was a guest link so we were

480
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,950
sure that it was clicked

481
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,139
by the company in this  link we do not know

482
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:09,499
if we had sent to me with hello kaka

483
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:12,200
and a photo could also be that

484
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,629
they would have sinned all the same but we

485
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:16,519
do not have the no that but it would be

486
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:18,710
interesting to know in the sense it is

487
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,769
worth the effort to create an

488
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:22,580
ad hoc email

489
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,679
when maybe clickers had  really

490
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:28,070
about chao kakà in my opinion

491
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,299
from personal experience so

492
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:32,119
professional in this case I

493
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,340
tell you when you use testico m

494
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,710
as I said before standard and translated

495
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,080
with those google translate ebook and

496
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,659
jump on I'm talking about texts written

497
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:49,999
recently not hello I'm prince  of

498
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:52,999
stocazzo that is also something

499
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:55,429
simply like south the documents you

500
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:58,429
were expecting greetings are things

501
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:00,139
that generally do not click for the

502
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,869
experience of personal experience no

503
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:05,590
because if you do not have a trust at the beginning,

504
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,629
the trust I said before with

505
00:24:08,629 --> 00:24:10,460
the end user you are going to

506
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,119
interact with the low

507
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,950
medium level low medium high level end user

508
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,379
who is not trusting you  to go

509
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:20,239
and open a document because because

510
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,850
now we are

511
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,090
in an era luckily that people are

512
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,400
starting to inquire there is what it

513
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:27,910
says

514
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,620
cabbage but the grip has arrived tolo that

515
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,090
was my home encrypted everything no

516
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,580
longer works for me nothing do not open the email  and

517
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,980
even the most clouded people know

518
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,500
this information and therefore

519
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,640
before trusting and therefore being trusted with

520
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,200
the end user

521
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,390
you must give a reason why

522
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,549
the user trusts you so in

523
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:54,909
practice this test was first yes  it is

524
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:58,510
a test made by

525
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,840
my personal penn testing experience so I

526
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,990
cannot answer

527
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,490
100% completely because I have not done a

528
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,370
real test on send an e-mail like this to

529
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,770
that company and to the same company and

530
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,230
I send it targeted also because

531
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,940
when we had actually even talked

532
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,250
about this thing but if we

533
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,530
sent a company an e-

534
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,720
mail with a link to a real e-mail with

535
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,799
a link we could no longer trust the

536
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,760
user to click  and on that real on

537
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,169
which there is on the one we were

538
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:36,640
interested in as a target and the funny one and

539
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,240
then we opted for this wire

540
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,179
in the one shot one kill email

541
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:48,669
exactly as you see by checking if lippi I have

542
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:51,220
always noticed how you have verified if

543
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,140
lippi that it will start from  where they left

544
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,820
call was really the company was

545
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,520
an ip space

546
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,809
the desk there was the name of the class the

547
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:03,370
name of the company name

548
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,470
here not through them number born

549
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,210
miners on the hard ebook through the ipi quiz

550
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,340
also the only one  what to be

551
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,590
one hundred percent precise

552
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,590
two of the emails sent precisely to

553
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,890
those of the hotels were a dsl alice

554
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,450
a tiscali if it is not if I remember correctly

555
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,920
because as I said before

556
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,210
a hotel cannot afford to

557
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,750
buy a class of 16  8 4x

558
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,360
ip addresses and use for the

559
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,490
hotel management the connection that

560
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:39,350
is provided by the area providers

561
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,360
just to repeat the concept of before

562
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,780
the links you sent were had

563
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,200
a specific href on an ip dir  once on a

564
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,210
domain

565
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,010
we have created a team of ours

566
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:57,120
we have created statistics shut up yes

567
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,890
oh well we do not tell you but a big

568
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:02,850
one similar to a slate 2 for everyone and everyone

569
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,450
is valid for all domains then slash which

570
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,940
obviously has that email address they

571
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,660
came straight to me  where to

572
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,910
ask we sent well the sly there

573
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:22,520
are no bases you understand we cannot say it for

574
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,490
various reasons it is therefore not a we indicate

575
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,260
a sender address that was credible

576
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,280
for the end user

577
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,900
it started from a gmail.com

578
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,660
ok hand started from a gmail come you

579
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,150
sent  let's say to a

580
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,550
transport company a perfectly

581
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,160
credible report if yes because it started from goofy

582
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,610
point [ __ ] snail gmail.com or

583
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,900
reaction that could have been it could be

584
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,880
that of the supermarket I'm dude

585
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,340
caio and I found myself [ __ ]

586
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,690
blue mozzarella effect as you see

587
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,160
bypass e

588
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,320
-mail checks aside no checks are needed

589
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,840
finally tario there is the

590
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,670
mail system for example soldier gmail and lippi is

591
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,010
st  uf the checks fail mine

592
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,420
is classified as spam

593
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,180
as you see when bypassing them no

594
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,980
no kind of check was done

595
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,580
also because we sent

596
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,440
a link to an ip that was a

597
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,080
virtual machine just created on amazon to vs and however they

598
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,360
started from that but no  limits

599
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,700
elements started from jim and at fly by

600
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,700
wire and gmail all the masses started

601
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,780
from gmail web client

602
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:46,410
let's say gmail you see then denies mail but

603
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,550
as you did in the end there is you

604
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,400
feel you can feel that it is close

605
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,650
even more  how did you figure out

606
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,030
if whoever had visited the url was the

607
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,540
user who received the email or was it an

608
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,310
anti spam system that went to

609
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,430
check cells a url in the emails

610
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,950
there was no virus I ask very

611
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,500
intelligent good good good

612
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,930
we went to  see you people because

613
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,620
you people are at least she

614
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,540
anti spam gent is so smart

615
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,460
she gives me ics information related to

616
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,290
the operating system

617
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,190
we have checked the people

618
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,529
of every single of o  every single click on the

619
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:32,509
link so we knew it was a

620
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:35,120
car or six with safari rather than

621
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:42,969
the car windows with chrome in place

622
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,178
thanks to all

623
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,509
now i'm going to get a beer one

624
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:58,250
love the mozzarella and the other the fearful

625
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,970
someone tells you
