00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
hello everyone i am davide walked I have

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,580
been dealing with design aids for the disabled

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,700
for a few years and today I wanted

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,370
to show you what we have done for a

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,560
child in Cesena from our land

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,590
area where I come from and as a fab lab

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,510
we have all collaborated together

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,580
for  create an aid

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,800
that does not exist on the market and that the father has

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,070
expressly requested to help

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,530
him move around the house to

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,660
practically help his son interact

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,579
better with the people who are

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,230
with him the aid is called mc1 here it

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,020
was designed in 3d  by some guys

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,940
from the fab lab it is

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,449
basically a cot where matteo is on the

18
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,219
wooden part obviously there are all

19
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,039
the mats all the right things

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,010
to be able to sit or lie down for a long time

21
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,030
sorry in this project here it

22
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,530
is practically the modification of a first

23
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,549
invention of his father

24
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,560
the need of matteo is this here matteo

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,460
alla sma one is a disease that

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,380
could be defined logged in in the  sense

27
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,060
that it allows you to move only your

28
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,270
eyes was already born like this so his life

29
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,119
has always been and with a

30
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,119
non-verbal communication it is only through the

31
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,299
ritual eyes they really

32
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,920
perfectly complete everything that his

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,810
son says to him even if simply by

34
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,729
moving his eyes to  one year a

35
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,850
gesture he has a very refined gesture with his

36
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,430
eyes and his parents are very good

37
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,990
at being able to

38
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,009
understand his needs

39
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,720
but then when there are people

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,540
who are not used to

41
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,219
interfacing with matteo and it

42
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,020
becomes complicated because he

43
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,180
would like to tell you  of things and you do not always

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,689
understand why you are

45
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,850
trying to make sure that he has

46
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,220
a better communication with the people

47
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,880
around him

48
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,620
even overcoming those who are the limits

49
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,730
instead of what doctors and

50
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,440
infrastructures in general and  they have

51
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:29,200
as their potential

52
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,910
practically the main problem of

53
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,970
many people with rare diseases is that

54
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,830
that medicine is not up to date with

55
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,620
technology so aids that have

56
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,690
been approved by the us as

57
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,900
something that can be financed are

58
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,360
based on a 20 year old list

59
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,640
in the meantime we have had tablets

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,190
we have had much

61
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,730
more laptops  performance and computer vision has

62
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,530
made great strides

63
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,960
but what a speech therapist can

64
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,230
prescribe for a person must be

65
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,570
traced back to something that was already

66
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,150
approved 20 years ago so in fact there

67
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,310
is not much innovation for them

68
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,530
simply because then there would not be

69
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,690
so that the health care company passes the

70
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,910
medical center and therefore it is necessary

71
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,200
as a maker to bypass

72
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,920
this by-pass to bypass this block

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,670
and bring the technology where it is needed and

74
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,600
where it is available

75
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,140
we did it starting from a

76
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,850
bed that simply goes four

77
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,350
wheels  therefore it was in all respects

78
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,560
equivalent to a stretcher and in the house he

79
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,590
had difficulty moving

80
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,540
simply because being sem  pre

81
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,030
connected to the electric current to

82
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,450
power the respirator,

83
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,950
dehumidifier and other machinery we

84
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,600
always traveled with an extension

85
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,370


86
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,160


87
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,370


88
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,590
cable around the house every time we moved we often had to unload this extension then jump with the cariolo over some wires that were

89
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,959
still annoying

90
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,490
we tried to  to improve all

91
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,220
these critical issues that

92
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,180
there were by

93
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,190
designing something that had

94
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,100
stretcher wheels to be able to better climb over

95
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,830
the wires something that could be

96
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,800
lifted higher or lower

97
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,630
simply because when you are at the

98
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,389
table you are higher than everyone else  we are

99
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:34,810
seated at the top and therefore matteo stands

100
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,280
higher to be in visual contact with

101
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,530
those parents when instead both on the

102
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,750
sofa watching a movie is much

103
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,780
lower and xi lets the

104
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,030
piston lower and still maintains

105
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,880
eye contact with matteo  here we

106
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,410
needed something that rose and

107
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,389
lowered is something that could

108
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,669
translate on itself without

109
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,560
it  ceasing to have to move the wheels

110
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,240
underneath so that this is the central pivot is

111
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,479
only the upper part you can turn

112
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,810
so you can make Matteo

113
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,259
look at a personal or a lan person

114
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,479
without having to take care of the extensions

115
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,580
that are under it simply by making it

116
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,940
rotate you remember it  we did not

117
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,180
particularly need the image

118
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,650
of the technical things start now and

119
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,280
they were not described in the image the

120
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,229
challenge we wanted to do is

121
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,389
this here beautiful the idea of

122
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:36,250
simplifying these things here but they are

123
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,260
simplifications for the people for the

124
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,770
nurses who are with  matteo we

125
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,260
can give the command to matteo of

126
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,030
this thing that then matteo can

127
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,479
voluntarily move to the right or

128
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,610
left or rotate on himself so

129
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,190
to watch the people entering the

130
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,770
room so if someone enters a

131
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,349
room and matteo was looking at his mother

132
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:02,289
matteo  can with a gesture of the eyes

133
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:05,919
rotates the system and look at the person

134
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,930
who as soon as you enter ch  and he is talking

135
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,400
this was the challenge we

136
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,960
faced as a fab lab and we

137
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,270
innovated a lot because everything

138
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,770
that is currently based on

139
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,349
eye recognition is something that has been

140
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:22,300
studied simply to be used

141
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,480
in front of

142
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,180
a warning in front of a computer and the

143
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,870
eye pointer  it simply

144
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,360
shows where the voltage is where you are

145
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,460
looking with the eye brings the

146
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,630
arrow of the mouse there then it

147
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,920
matches a movement of the eye

148
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,250
to the movement of the mouse on the computer there

149
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,900
are particular programs for

150
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,730
composing the communicators with the

151
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,550
on-screen keyboard and yes  however, he writes

152
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,800
out of this context of I am in front of

153
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,530
the computer and I am writing in

154
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,720
normal life the eye pointer

155
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,830
completely useless even the most

156
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,440
expensive ones do not adapt to normal life because when they are turned

157
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,110
on they

158
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,910
require calibration where you have to

159
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,160
look at specific points to understand

160
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,620
to make people understand  to the eye pointer how

161
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,260
the head is turned what is the luminos  ity and

162
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,900
other factors for which they are useless in

163
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,110
mobility to us if something more arrives

164
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,670
here that the market has not yet

165
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,250
created

166
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,830
I have started to do the part of

167
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,680
the eye pointer movement and here

168
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,020
now I will tell you a little bit is the story of

169
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,210
this thing  that also because I think it

170
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,910
is also important to understand the dynamics

171
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,890
with which this type of

172
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,620
device is made I initially

173
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,520
appreciated it in a very

174
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,100
engineering way I took some sunglasses

175
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,610


176
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,520
I removed a lens I took the phone

177
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,130
webcam or removed the infrared filter

178
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,850
from the  lens some webcams allow it

179
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,380
I put the infrared LED crown

180
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,600
all around the camera in order to

181
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,610
over-illuminate the eye is the only thing

182
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,650
that was not illuminated was the pupil

183
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,930
as it is a hole and therefore easily

184
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,880
with the camera going to trace

185
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,010
what is the darkest object the center

186
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,630
of the darkest object in the image

187
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,480
I had the exact center of the pupil and

188
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,190
I was working from two and a half centimeters of

189
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,760
dis

190
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,070
therefore or bombproof in a certain

191
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,810
sense with all the lighting I

192
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,060
had and I independent of the

193
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,370
ambient light from all the rest euro very

194
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,720
satisfied with my

195
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,140
invention when it was presented to

196
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,000
matteo's parents they make me it's

197
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,030
beautiful but our son knows  azhar

198
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,299
the inhaler in the nose and on a cot if

199
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,880
now you tell me that to use it

200
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,140
we also have to wear glasses that

201
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,929
look like robocop the other children get a

202
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,880
little scared and there I realized

203
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,910
that what was perfectly

204
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,410
functional for me does not  it was not at all

205
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,530
suitable for the public administration where it was used if

206
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,240
he had not had the sensitivity to understand

207
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,120
that in reality the child still

208
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,480
had his own where he still did not get

209
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,640
too raped by this new

210
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,980
technology so we started

211
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,960
rethinking the thing and how to be able to

212
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,360
work  remote distance for me

213
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,180
ie about 40 cm so that I did not

214
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,120
close his sight too much and anyway

215
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,780
and he also had way to the nurse

216
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,640
in any case to help matteo while he was

217
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,890
looking after him working from 40

218
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,250
centimeters away means

219
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,820
no longer using something that is fixed and is already

220
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,920
calibrated but where it was somehow

221
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,590
read the image of the camera and

222
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,660
then used by computer vision for

223
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,430
computer vision i mean offensive i

224
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,670
am libraries it is a framework

225
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,470
that Inter made many years ago and

226
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,540
which is now very fashionable in

227
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,280
quotation marks is the same system that is

228
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,000
used for which to train and drive

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,320
cars that drive themselves

230
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,780
if  there are the same conceptual foundations of

231
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,760
libraries that are inside cars

232
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,260
that drive themselves or that understand

233
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,450
signs so something

234
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,720
that is really ruling out right now

235
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,430
is fortunately exploding because they are

236
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,190
coming out with a lot of material

237
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,760
suitable for computer vision  the complete

238
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,530
vision initially made them so

239
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,110
distance camera always mounts

240
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,260
with webcams throughout the system

241
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,220
h  o used a 30 euro webcam and a node

242
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,140
that costs a hundred euro as

243
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,050
hardware the camera was far away

244
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,090
we changed the optics we

245
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,580
approached the face

246
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,930
face recognition eye recognition

247
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,280
find which is the predominant eye

248
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,220
therefore the most easily visible and

249
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,620
on the one there to look where the pupil

250
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,620
then zum zum zum looking from the

251
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,870
pupil and discreet zari three gestures

252
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,580
look at the center look right look

253
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,700
left eagle distances there I could

254
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,610
n't be more precise than that at

255
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,200
any brightness I still managed

256
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,050
to have three discrete states for  where I

257
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,360
started working here gesture for me

258
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,840
gestures means if within three seconds

259
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,610
you have looked at the camera is looked at by the

260
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,530
installed camera is looked

261
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,390
at the right again for me the gesture was

262
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,940
voluntary so you want to move to the

263
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,410
right and the voting starts the same thing

264
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,480
then  for the for the left to

265
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,790
pause you look at the camera for five

266
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,560
seconds turn on  lights at that moment

267
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,720
you are paused and your eye is free to

268
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,130
look wherever you want

269
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,080
there is another gesture to re-enter

270
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,600
command mode again and when it is

271
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,940
in command mode right left

272
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,850
right center right center the system

273
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,530


274
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,970
empty throughout the computer vision system  it

275
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,520
consists of 200 lines of code the

276
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,190
most difficult part was understanding which

277
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,370
hardware to use and also the

278
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,530
cameras we tested to

279
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,600
keep costs very low because

280
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,970
the goal is what

281
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,380
we have developed as fab lab

282
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,210
evans and it took us a year and a

283
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,690
half  to optimize it it is something that

284
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,820
must be built very close to the

285
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,500
person it needs continuous feedback

286
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,840
from family members also tests with the

287
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,400
person to understand it is going in

288
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,950
the right direction it cannot be

289
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,590
reproduced and sold on the internet I have

290
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,260
made remote existence or training for

291
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,130
family members

292
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,570
we have  I need this project here to

293
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,990
be taken by other people in the

294
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,330
fab lab who then take care of it  in their

295
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,209
areas

296
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:38,509
Bari Naples wherever there is if they know that

297
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,339
this project exists and come into

298
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:41,629
contact with people who have these

299
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,759
needs they know that something has been

300
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,619
developed that is a team is

301
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:48,860
working on it and maybe we can

302
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,199
bring our same experience back to

303
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:52,790
other places as well  I think it is the only

304
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,350
way that this project here has not

305
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,269
only served a child who is already a

306
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:00,199
lot because it has made a difference

307
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,269
for him it makes

308
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:03,980
other people also be passive and active dancer when they

309
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,790
see that he activates something

310
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,040
awakens you a little  the thing that is, he is

311
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,689
carrying the tension beware he has

312
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:15,110
turned to look at you so also

313
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,399
emotionally it is very important if you are

314
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,779
okay saying a little more in the

315
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,129
technical aspect you are more interested

316
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:24,699
in the human aspect or the human technical one

317
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:27,339
without much he does not see the  camera

318
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,269
those you who deepen a little on the

319
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:30,769
aspect of what was my

320
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,379
experience with matteo or I go down

321
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,389
to the technical parts  and because so you see

322
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,639
if it is something that you can reproduce and

323
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:40,519
you are technically interested in it for the technician

324
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,240
raise your hand

325
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,259
ok for the human aspect instead then to

326
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:50,240
understand what was underneath and then

327
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,970
maybe possibly contribute from

328
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,670
the technical human aspect wins

329
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,449
slightly  the human aspect then

330
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:02,929
we do it by me in the villa aids

331
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:06,499
ok then technically technically the

332
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:09,040
cameras part crazy the camera

333
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,569
cameras tested 500 euros of

334
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:14,980
cameras of all possible models

335
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,450
found to understand which was the one

336
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:23,029
that took me a frame of good

337
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,250
quality and apple tree  managed to render in the

338
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,900
format that interested me in the

339
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,700
shortest possible time so that even

340
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,320
quick eye gestures were

341
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,920
captured

342
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,529
I aimed at 30 frames per second the most

343
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:40,070
performing was the

344
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,089
camera of the 20 euro room of the playstation

345
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:46,270
so not even stuff to  computer this

346
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,470
this playstation eye two fires

347
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:57,050
far near is used to do something

348
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,029
like pokémon go when still  a it

349
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,460
was done with the playstation so games

350
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,180
like augmented reality

351
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,490
this here at usb3 you want to avoid this

352
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,100
here manages to give me a frame every 7

353
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,980
milliseconds frame at the maximum of its

354
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,010
decision every 7 milliseconds under

355
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,600
windows it does not work if not with a drive

356
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,980
to the owner who has  written by a

357
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,020
guy but for 2 euro he

358
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,290
sends you the file under linux plug'n'play

359
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,640
but it was big and too big and too

360
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,170
difficult to find as it is no longer in

361
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,990
production and there are

362
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,640
stock funds we could not rely on

363
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,080
that so yes  technically it is

364
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,920
fantastic but we could not go on

365
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,750
logitech logitech 27 euro

366
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,170
this was the choice it was

367
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,959
the choice because at the

368
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:55,640
end the camera part is very small and only

369
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,779
this is the optics when you remove

370
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:01,640
the glass already includes the infrared

371
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,410
so you do not have to act on the cc of

372
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,510
trying to remove the

373
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,350
infrared hunt film

374
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,509
so with the camera the 27th August after

375
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:15,160
the camera we had to use the c

376
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,600
computer vision and computer vision and is based on

377
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,509
very particular libraries that take

378
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,279
advantage in acceleration if there

379
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,829
are

380
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:25,899


381
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:27,940


382
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,190


383
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,040
open clues.  range was the barry

384
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,970
one does not have the opengl in hardware it

385
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,779
works but it takes a lot of effort we

386
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:44,040
tested wrong it costs 35 dollars

387
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,149
we started to test all the

388
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:48,759
micro boards that are there the most

389
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,290
interesting is another is an

390
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,639
italian project born at that time there this

391
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,339
is  the made a spin off

392
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:59,170
of the university of florence is called udo

393
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,839
at the time when there is berry 1 this was

394
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,799
already a quad core with 1 gb of ram and had

395
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,740
an arduino due already on board so you can

396
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,809
install linux and then control the

397
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:15,429
motors  all with the same board this

398
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:19,720
is wireless and to the opengl 1.1 not full

399
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,089
compliant however there are all

400
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,549
the social networks that were needed to

401
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:26,319
recompile open sea to compile

402
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,179
open you want  get the

403
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,940
graphic celebration fantastic italian project among

404
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,890
other things it is also fanless so you

405
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,570
can reach it everywhere and you don't care about

406
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,429
having to do maintenance on the

407
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:38,400
fan

408
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,870
this is the second piece of the system

409
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,400
obviously before arriving these two

410
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,830
here we bought practically of

411
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,120
everything we bought also the o droid

412
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,980
this is lately this is very

413
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,150
nice as 8 core 2gb ram usb3 card

414
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,080
already integrated is with this here is this

415
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,390
takes a frame every 7 milliseconds

416
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,429
this obviously will be the future but

417
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:08,049
this one requires a fan so

418
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:10,000
a little  like pink and he had a fan

419
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,400
behind his neck close to you anyway that

420
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,620
always makes the noise in our opinion it was

421
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,520
not it was not the case

422
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,010
we must also be fans we were

423
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,490
quite tight in specifications

424
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,970
we have to work without wires already there

425
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,409
are his children we do not add or

426
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,899
others  systems of matteo perhaps not all of

427
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,850
them for a limited period of time

428
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,330
even on battery but it means that

429
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,519
removed all the wires you can go to the

430
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:41,200
garden and go around anyway without

431
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,010
any

432
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,620
wire, ours should not have been the wire

433
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,120
that kept it closed in the house because we

434
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,010
had to find motors and for the

435
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,990
movement that worked at low

436
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,539
voltage and had a lot of energy

437
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,659
for  being able to move the fifth wheel then

438
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:02,080
the gear that was on it

439
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,260
we started with the windscreen wiper

440
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,750
of the car it is a very strong motor it

441
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,929
does little movement but it was grainy

442
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:13,330
it was not very strong but with the levers in

443
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,330
play it did not work we switched to the

444
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,120
motors for the  3d printers in itself but

445
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,480
the classic ones there is a literature per

446
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,070
month on these motors you can

447
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,899
have all the specifications the

448
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:29,019
problem is that the torsion force was

449
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:32,049
such that the technical problem was I

450
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:35,529
have the motor connected upstairs

451
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:37,590
if I wanted to move the upstairs

452
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,789
autonomously at the same time,

453
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:41,710
the motor in which it is connected would also

454
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,450
move is more or reduced the revolutions d  el

455
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,639
upstairs with the engine more to the

456
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:50,529
movement of the upstairs I am making

457
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:53,860
the engine fail so the engine is

458
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,159
rowing against me

459
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:58,870
and something says love like the bicycle dynamo

460
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,880


461
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,679
we need very large

462
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:04,630
very powerful engines that practically do not

463
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,370
going its needs a lot of

464
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,919
reduction in order to make the

465
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:11,980
movement of the part above the lashes

466
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,120
given away is an advertisement that I feel I

467
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,000
can do and risk the uisp of

468
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,039
those who just what printers

469
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,460
they have made a mega printer

470
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,679
12 meters high seems to me the  motors of that

471
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:28,510
printer there who have those with whom

472
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,090
they have tested the suitable motors all the

473
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,550
inventories gere we go

474
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,680
with these here we have found a

475
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,450
fairly powerful motor among the motors that

476
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,660
they have given us has flown there are

477
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,940
also many data to possibly also make

478
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,290
the  next prototypes because in any case they

479
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,830
are difficult to find

480
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,500
so the mechanics part had been

481
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,920
managed you have questions I don't know something about

482
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,740
you c  ui it is not so much because you use it

483
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,080
from here and you do it shores out and

484
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,350
how much more it is because you discover a little

485
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:05,220
how much technically what has been done

486
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,620
and where the difficulties lie where

487
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,260
the problems lurk is a little to

488
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,470
share my experience with  you

489
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,640
then if there are electronic devices in

490
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,230
some moments they will also arrive because

491
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,930
we have done some incredible things

492
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,030
ok then it exists but it turns at this

493
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,010
moment it turns but cannot always turn

494
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,470
because in any case made with wires and

495
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,390
therefore we needed these wires

496
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,550
not to wrap around the  'only

497
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,560
central pivot so he had

498
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,020
somehow to do a certain number

499
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,870
of laps then stop and then be able to turn to the

500
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,550
other side so it was necessary

501
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,690
a limit switch that counts six laps and

502
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,520
told the computer look

503
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,280
at the end of the  file pulled do not

504
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,720
turn on that side yet but turn

505
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,140
on the other side

506
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,470
in this event I would have been

507
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:03,900
beaten useful the computer okay I go

508
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,420
on anyway so we have  o the

509
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,540
system the motors arm that points to the

510
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,050
camera we praise matteo tries it a little

511
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,060
there is an enormous difficulty in the

512
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,250
camera to point the eye this

513
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,180
because at 30 cm a bit of zoom if already

514
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,610
who is who was going to place it was  a

515
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,590
little more to the right or a little more left the

516
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,390
camera simply didn't even see

517
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,340
Matteo but is seeing an object

518
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,980
elsewhere and so we had to

519
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,140
give feedback to the person pointing

520
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,610
at the camera so he had mounted a

521
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,270
monitor to allow more or less

522
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,050
understand where the camera is pointing

523
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,140
thanks to this monitor

524
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,330
and we are able to also other

525
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,790
information to the user like you have

526
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,310
reached the end of the stroke there are

527
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,330
certain problems in the system so

528
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,830
from what we had designed it

529
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,950
actually became with a bracket for the

530
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,490
camera a  bracket for the monitor

531
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,070
batteries positioned in another way if it

532
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,830
evolves continuously over time

533
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,620
in the end we delivered it

534
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,050
so they tried it perfect

535
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,490
we think about the  version 2 relationship two

536
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,920
must be even easier to

537
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,410
use in the face uses it means

538
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,720
that but nothing of the camera must not

539
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,910
be far away there must be no

540
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,160
targeting of the eye from this

541
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,720
part of the person who takes care of it

542
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,730
also because they are usually the

543
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,620
nurses families with technology

544
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,850
are not necessarily

545
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,540
familiar so this strange device is

546
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,070
seen as a complication in some

547
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,220
cases if it works

548
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,860
transparently it serves fantastic the more

549
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,730
we ask for competence from those who use it the

550
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:59,800
more it becomes problematic then

551
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,290
we rethink the camera  and we think about the

552
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,030
camera and I discovered that on the internet

553
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,830
there are things that they call

554
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,940
endoscopes cost 12 euros they

555
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,430
work with both the computer and

556
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,440
any phone

557
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,970
this is the camera but you have the

558
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,300
final part 2 megapixels and among other things

559
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,040
also a crown of LEDs  that illuminate

560
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,590
with this here is placed at this

561
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,220
distance

562
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,980
I would have all that c  he I need it

563
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,210
spending very little without good even to

564
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,350
modify anything and at this distance it is

565
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,419
easy not to miss the eye

566
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:47,320
ok they have turned on the tesla maybe for

567
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:53,200
what has been recharged then

568
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,290
oh well they need and this

569
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,940
would have already helped me in the part of the engines

570
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,140
but of the camera between  the other one

571
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,330
that comes back is worth things but having said we have

572
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,100
the problem of ok but how do we

573
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,360
make sure that the camera reaches

574
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,700
under the eye and then it does not move

575
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,650
because in any case there is a movement it is

576
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,420
mounted on the wires yes  pass over

577
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,510
several things that I said but look use

578
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,730
what I use to throw the

579
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,280
coolant in the cold the lathe

580
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,960
that you move it as you like but when

581
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,390
she stopped various stopped this is a bit

582
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,190
is a high technology product is

583
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,010
what it throws  the coolant

584
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,930
in the tournament utilities and it is perfect

585
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,710
because it is fixed points where you want and he

586
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,170
is there and his function was also hollow

587
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,370
pass the wire

588
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,170
fantastic sometimes having the knowledge

589
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,380
down  ste

590
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,270
ok so in the next version there

591
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,190
will probably be that camera there

592
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,240
that was much easier to point

593
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,590
or another path that we have taken

594
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,970
before I was talking about the computer

595
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:07,260
vision of how much you are investing

596
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,070
there is this camera here

597
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,260
already has the computer vision written  in the chips

598
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,660
then this one is already able to do

599
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,120
object recognition the camera that

600
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:27,700
costs less than 100 euros 5 megapixels is used

601
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,500
for rows of robots playing football

602
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,690
she is born so it recognizes round objects it

603
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,430
recognizes the one already all of that

604
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,140
color happy says where is the  center of

605
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,210
that object if you are how big it was

606
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,340
and the data object also calculates

607
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,610
the distance by changing the firmware of

608
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,140
this instead of knowing a

609
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,430
round object you can make it recognize

610
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,480
an eye and the round object then inside

611
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,900
pupil and her

612
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,000
therefore without computer without other things

613
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,780
with less than 100 euros in hardware therefore very

614
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,460
robust, very fast and from the

615
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,940
position of the welding eye

616
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,730
the camera part and bringing out

617
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,890
only the camera all the rods the

618
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,840
base is placed somewhere else

619
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,970
we have a perfectly

620
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,650
functional eye sensor I have already tested it would

621
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,290
work perfectly functional

622
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:19,970
and here from hicks and y where is the

623
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,140
center of the  'eye then the hardware

624
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,290
chance are taking huge steps by

625
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,120
giants but in completely

626
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,520
different directions than the uncle of the disabled

627
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,790
this here is made to make robots

628
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,750
oh well this here I do not even say

629
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,100
as I said before we have

630
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,560
members given only three  gestures center

631
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,390
right and left in some cases there

632
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,670
are false positives horrible the

633
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,190
combination very complex and difficult

634
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,210
to reproduce

635
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,520
or if you are simple looking

636
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,070
around it can happen to trigger a

637
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,770
command so you already have one

638
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,920
more chance in series aa this command here

639
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,950
an impulse  plus it could eliminate

640
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,860
false positives and the extra impulse

641
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,890
could come from the brain this

642
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,470
one  device created for those who

643
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,890
go to cosplay and dress like a cat

644
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:22,080
specifically and is

645
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,169
a helmet that reads brain waves

646
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:27,669
very simple to use this is made

647
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:28,990
more a person who is not a technician is

648
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,269
a girl who wants to go and move

649
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:34,539
her ears  around and therefore does not know it

650
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:36,460
is something that does not require

651
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,350
particular calibration plug'n'play you put it on

652
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,570
you sit on your

653
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,370
brain for a moment and based on what you think

654
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,129
he moves his ears I know you want

655
00:28:45,129 --> 00:28:45,759
him to do it

656
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:48,240
you want him  ago c obviously we

657
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,610
are here on purpose

658
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:58,049
exactly we have to train a little but

659
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:00,850
since in reality it only requires

660
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,450
two contacts with the body 1 fan 1

661
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,909
here and one on the earlobe among

662
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:09,190
the other yesterday one of you I do not know no is not

663
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,960
present  now he told me that

664
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,230
he uses it upside down reading

665
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,450
on the cerebral cortex in the

666
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,899
back and upper part of the brain captures the visual part

667
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:22,480
of the brain that is connected to the

668
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,129
visual instead of the one connected to the

669
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:27,659
emotions so it is more  easy then to

670
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:30,970
train to arouse arouse

671
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,769
emotions active this sees and imagining

672
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:37,749
colors would activate that other

673
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:40,119
probably the technique of imagining

674
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:43,330
colors or in any case being linked

675
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,529
something visual is easier to use

676
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:49,029
anyway just stop chatting

677
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:51,600
let's start doing serious things

678
00:29:51,600 --> 00:30:00,039
then you do me propiano  also

679
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,669
obviously

680
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,630
this moment

681
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,700
doing is finding the background noise

682
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:17,180
weapons to the brain let's say

683
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,970
for so much noise you have a bit ok if

684
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,310
you look forward it is calibrated electronics

685
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,870
that lower and relax

686
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:34,580
all the ears that rise and strong

687
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,330
emotion the canvases of who who  sway

688
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,910
so it's more or less normal someone

689
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,470
quite relaxed or that I don't have

690
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,030
feedback of how they are like on the

691
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,120
ears down ok I'm relaxed so

692
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,540
I'm fine

693
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:53,090
here ok empathic wanted to anticipate

694
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,980
unfortunately there is this problem here that you think you

695
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,340


696
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,130
think to say now I think that  what

697
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,650
do you do there time to say what they have already

698
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,480
told you and then later I wanted to tell you

699
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,060
now I will think about ma i  Fate 10 thought is

700
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,160
a bit like the elephant don't think about the fans

701
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,980
you are thinking about the phases now I think

702
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:16,960
the elephant ok it's quite easy to

703
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,230
do obviously we only need to

704
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,450
stylize a couple of states but if we

705
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,040
have also put this system in place  here in

706
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,040
addition to the left and right a minimum of

707
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,340
concentration to have a certain state

708
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,470
we would have an extra signal that

709
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,940
is queued and we have much less false

710
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:49,190
positives or even more commands or

711
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,960
what can be done once

712
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,610
we still had a computer that

713
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:59,780
a connected arduino read his eyes and a lot and a

714
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,900
great desire to do we gave ourselves

715
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,060
around via we thought but it is with

716
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,650
arduino and with a computer we can

717
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,050
control many things not only the

718
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,610
engine that is underneath we can for example

719
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,110
control the television that happens

720
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:15,500
infrared  like raised

721
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,540
shutters lowered because in the house they have

722
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,820
shutters with infrared or in any case

723
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,010
also change channel change volume

724
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,300
everything you can with  send

725
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,970
with infrared then the gesture of the

726
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,610
eyes have increased has become

727
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,550
pages there is the green page where

728
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,620
you make certain gestures you move right to

729
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,490
left

730
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,440
if you make a certain gesture you change the page

731
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,360
go to the red page from here

732
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,610
certainly doing the same gestures you know

733
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,429
turning on and off the television and

734
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:45,559
then going to different pages even

735
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:49,370
if we have a few few states by changing

736
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,470
the pages those states we use them

737
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,260
to control the infrared control the

738
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,300
television the radio and therefore in reality

739
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,960
we are already starting to build  more

740
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,880
with what little we have done we have

741
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,580
a certain sense this speech of the

742
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,429
center right to the left is a framework

743
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:08,150
for us

744
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,670
we start from that there and then we start

745
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,170
to look around what we can

746
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,720
do

747
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,929
I tell you what what happened what we

748
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,880
say here  that the state of the art of the

749
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,770
project is this here we are working

750
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,340
to extrapolate the serial data and from

751
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,860
this there is already a project to do it

752
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,679
on the stable

753
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,990
we are working to find a way to

754
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,070
make it easy to use this is

755
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:40,460
this however we continue to

756
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,350
see each other with matteo always even when

757
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,790
we never have anything to bring as

758
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,710
new

759
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,790
things a very nice thing that happened

760
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,950
to me in a while that I was there with matteo and this

761
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,340
I speak  as a nerd geek programmer it

762
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,040
was that his cousin was there a short while ago

763
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,740
nine years same age the game between

764
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,630
matteo his cousin was what she

765
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,030
drew things and then did them there

766
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,559
was matteo and matteo with eye gestures he

767
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,660
said to me  like i don't like what

768
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,530
that thing is there

769
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,639
if we went home and laughs i

770
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,850
went home and from

771
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,290
matthew's eye pointer computer

772
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,699
i installed python and built 100

773
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,040
lines of code i'm good at 100 lines i

774
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,139
do everything tv 100  lines of

775
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:29,780
code from timi centro yesterday codes I

776
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,780
do everything I can do even from the right and from the

777
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,489
left ball that bounces in the middle

778
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,980
the left racket connected to the

779
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,780
ocular sensor reads p  For the position

780
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,760
of the mouse I am simply interested

781
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,500
only in the position of the mouse

782
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,750
but you look up the racket goes

783
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,489
all in wherever he looks matteo up and

784
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:48,030
down from qatar he

785
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,949
moves his cousin instead with the keyboard

786
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:53,280
up and down for the ball or modified

787
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,690
the  rule of the game because it seemed

788
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,280
more compelling to me the

789
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,740
winner is the one who touches the ball does not make you

790
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,110
lose the opponent every time the ball is played

791
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,500
in two

792
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,600
parts I touch it we

793
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,060
make a point tula you who make a point

794
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,280
the game was related to being able to

795
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,510
touch the palin and not to make the

796
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,540
other mistake but there is a question of my

797
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,140
approach and matteo won the game

798
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,420
three times that is his cousin and he

799
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,980
was beaten by matteo three times

800
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,590
for the first time so matteo was

801
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,040
participant also for his cousin

802
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,580
and will have skills he put her in

803
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,980
punishment sometimes that is the thing is

804
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,480
at all competitive from a certain point it

805
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,610
had to turn off after half an hour more or

806
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,860
less of play ok it goes  well as long as

807
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:43,170
you get tired you get tired too and think

808
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,120
about what having the skills to do it

809
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,840
trivial essentially is the

810
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,370
right person here this thing here is needed in

811
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,630
my opinion who has special skills

812
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:59,250
crossed people with needs with

813
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,680
special needs could derive

814
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,650
enormous satisfaction from  from the south and there

815
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,990
from his skills to see them really

816
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,420
used for something useful I

817
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,710
conclude the talk here and for those who

818
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,450
want aids villas I will show

819
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,270
you everything else to be done by the students

820
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,810
thanks to everyone
