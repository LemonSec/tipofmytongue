1
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:33,180
try try hello everyone today took the

2
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,930
place of another but I think I can

3
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,920
still make these presentations

4
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,809
because I consider myself an expert in the subject

5
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,790
since I have followed it from the beginning I

6
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,260
think I was one of the first

7
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,640
Italians to follow the topic of

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,250
written wishes my name is franco cimatti

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,980
eating I am I met with the

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,039
nick name of fact it is easy to find on

11
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,739
google because I less write everywhere

12
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:57,449
to do to promote this type of

13
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,680
technology and now the slides are

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,969
just ready because it was not me

15
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,549
who had to talk  but I can show

16
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,280
city or and speak in general

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,430
answer questions I can ask there are

18
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,490
I see a bit how I can manage it

19
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,570
more than anything else on maybe to see for a

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,890
moment what the knowledge is anyway

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,299
I ask a few questions that is how many of you

22
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,670
have but not  many will have heard a little

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,100
about bitcoin and those who

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,720
own some have

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,299
a bit of it also that I know that he has made

26
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,369
transactions, let's say  ok how many instead a

27
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,110
who first of all talk about st word of the b

28
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,900
kondri keto wishes that more or less all of

29
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,890
them like this but you have also read a bit

30
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,820
ungenerous information comes from

31
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,409
newspapers you are

32
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,710
directly informative skip the mother yes they are

33
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,820
for the internet newspapers so all of

34
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,630
them d  't orange ok but it's a good thing

35
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,870
yes yes of course yes but in general the

36
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,790
press speaks badly of technologies of

37
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,110
things that it does not know how it must cause a

38
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,020
sensation to pull to attract

39
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,180
readers so it is natural that it happens

40
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,250
immediately and with complex things we say

41
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,350
all  'beginning of the area to be understood now

42
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,290
speaking in general even if I try to

43
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,690
speak quite simply it will

44
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,880
be necessary how banal orientates

45
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,990
bitcoin was born in 2009 with the idea of

46
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,520
putting together various to say that they were

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,250
already around previously is a character

48
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,050
called satoshi nakamoto has  put

49
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,820
these ideas together and created

50
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,190
cryptocurrency before there were

51
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,540
digital currencies

52
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,730
now a real libertine serves p  ure and

53
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,170
gold dg coin it seems to me they were

54
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,090
always attempts to create

55
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,980
digital currencies

56
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,270
the problem is that all these, however, are

57
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,350
not dependent on a

58
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,940
centralized element that could be a

59
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,250
server or more than one, however there was an

60
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,670
entity that could be considered responsible

61
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,410
responsible and in fact all these

62
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,550
people who worked on these

63
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,250
projects for more or less legal reasons

64
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,380
beyond whether it was correct or wrong for

65
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,390
the reason why they blocked them

66
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,310
were put in jail close the

67
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,610
service or large fines in general

68
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,590
anyway always ended badly  instead in

69
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,720
2009 this satoshi nakamoto who does not

70
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,820
know who he is still currently is not known

71
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,890
he is not sure who he is has

72
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,410
developed an open source project brings

73
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,570
together various ideas that were previously

74
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,100
generally run on the menin guests of

75
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,239
crypto anarchists or

76
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,120
photography experts and let's say and

77
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,010
created bitcoin wrote a paper

78
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,080
with general explanations of how it

79
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,019
worked  the system and created the

80
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,800
first crypto currency the difference all

81
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,810
the others many digital pond

82
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,290
wanted and it is a centralized powerful peer to peer network

83
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,820
that is there is no

84
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,459
central server or server that

85
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,019
have a greater power than others and for

86
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:55,790
example  you come to think of other

87
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,890
peer to peer systems there was a house also a house

88
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,390
a peer to peer system is visited but there

89
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,489
were in the master server it seems to me that they were

90
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,230
called which in any case were

91
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,810
considered greater responsibilities

92
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,670
higher so those who are closed were closed

93
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,930
those you could still

94
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,910
block all how much the peer to peer network

95
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,540


96
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,530
instead of coin the all how many servers

97
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,410
are equal all how many nodes are

98
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,570
equal are equal to each other you can

99
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,930
download the open source software

100
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,009
install on your server on your

101
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,720
computer and run it

102
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,970
or you can also compile it because it

103
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,620
is an open source project from

104
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,789
top to bottom and once you want to

105
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:37,250
install the node you connect  to the

106
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,710
network and unlike other

107
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,780
peer to peer networks where files such as

108
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,840
music video games are exchanged, I know what

109
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,120
else is shared only one file

110
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,150
one scout only one database and this

111
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,830
database contains all the transactions

112
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,090
that are made within the

113
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,060
bitcoin network  since 2009 since

114
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,580
the network was launched practically

115
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,380
at the beginning there were 2 12 are connected

116
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,180
by making test transfers

117
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,280
already these small transfers up

118
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,780
within this mine database

119
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,610
shared between these two nodes then

120
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,500
the third arrives a third way disconnects and

121
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,970
begins to download everything and database

122
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,110
from the beginning

123
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,759
and this is to know to ensure

124
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,970
that all nodes know as well as

125
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,740
all transactions have also been the

126
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,750
history of all current

127
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,610
accounts current accounts are called

128
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,340
bitcoin addresses are open an

129
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,409
address  that's a bad 16 string and

130
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:28,400
just terminating all the addresses

131
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,590
you want by pretty much hitting the

132
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,780
button isn't  common type email that must

133
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,930
register or common ban ki moon

134
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,430
cultural you have to do everything

135
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,139
kensi operation to verify your with tv

136
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,030
opens an account in a server in a

137
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,560
city service from the bank 1

138
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,090
chipped button that generates

139
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,599
your account the bitcoin address  is

140
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:51,229
now this I can explain it however

141
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,570
the bitcoin address is practically a

142
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,370
public key or rather an ace of a

143
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,120
public key and when a man can generate

144
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,630
address a new account

145
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,680
practically you generate a

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,620
private key and the public

147
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,060
key of the public key is then generated a

148
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,190
ace and this slide published

149
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,580
around and I published it around

150
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,560
or around or privately to the single

151
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,669
people you want to pay you

152
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,470
and when you have created as said before

153
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,310
this address this address

154
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,900
within your personal client

155
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,520
is  generated is the private key the

156
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,100
private key will be used to sign

157
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,050
transactions and now I could give one

158
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,390
more example or me  no who is a little bit to

159
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,880
understand at least the pomace is good to

160
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,740
understand a gel use for people who do not

161
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,680
have photography greats but have

162
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,910
in mind how it works let's say

163
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,070
certified mail and know that in

164
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,450
certified mail or just you  you can

165
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,270
sign that e-mail message and

166
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,070
then if you are sure that you have signed it

167
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,480
not someone else,

168
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,010
the second can also be said for when

169
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,770
you go to sign bitcoin transactions

170
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,840
and you just say I am the one who

171
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,580
practically owns these big guys I

172
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,470
own this address

173
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,450
and I want to move a certain amount of these

174
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,590
bitcoins to another address so

175
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,650
far there is something that I too to

176
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,960
keep I stop every now and then I

177
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,980
ask questions there is something that has not been

178
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,570
understood in this this aspect

179
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,920
what I said that now  some question

180
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,620
some good and then as another thing

181
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,130
you could say now there is another

182
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,720
the other part is the generation of the

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,570
coins that this is the part plus one

184
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,040
of the parts on one side the room

185
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,820
with  I understand that mining before talking about

186
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,410
this we need to talk about what

187
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,420
generates value how the

188
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,780
value of things is frozen and there is one thing that in

189
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,990
general many do not have in mind they do not

190
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,250
understand exactly this aspect

191
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,200
they take it for granted then they do not  they

192
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,550
realize that maybe it is not how I can

193
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,190
think of them but the value is subjective

194
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,800
the value of all things subjective

195
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,010
so even if you say to me this

196
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,650
object is worth you at this moment

197
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,360
you use as a unit of value the euros

198
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,770
that maybe  of this ball is worth 10

199
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,510
euros but if you bet go to a

200
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,490
market on immediately.it about well there is

201
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,750
someone who could pay more

202
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,730
less precisely because the value

203
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,040
of that ball is valued

204
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,990
differently and I also give a

205
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,060
very example  extreme too you think or

206
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,130
the gold is worth a lot if however you are in the

207
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,840
middle of a desert is about to die of thirst

208
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,220
the same lines will make a mountain of gold

209
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,900
and a glass of water you give more

210
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,580
values to the glass of water

211
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,200
the truth of things changes according to the

212
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,940
people at the moment and the situation

213
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,690
making another example also

214
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,219
this is a bit extreme gold is

215
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,299
considered as something of great

216
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,429
value then you have to see why but

217
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,810
if an alien arrives from another planet

218
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,519
what a golden plane of your mountain

219
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,160
then they don't give a damn and this

220
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,170
even a person who can be very

221
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,000
rich from a different evaluation to

222
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,529
them too or anything else that many

223
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:55,700
people can give it a value

224
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,709
however one thing that needs to be

225
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,240
understood is that everything  what has

226
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,899
value there can be let's say an

227
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:06,920
agreement even a saying a fashion is

228
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,360
wrong but many people can give

229
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,709
value to a certain thing they told me

230
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,930
it will never be the same and it can change the

231
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,940
second of the situation and this to

232
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,829
explain that why the value  bitcoin in

233
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:18,140
value because different people

234
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,480
agree or follow the

235
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,190
network effect to see that that thing there is of

236
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,160
value and that we must

237
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,110
also weigh  and how the coin was born

238
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,500
the coin is the most traded object

239
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,720
at the beginning in antiquity the coin did not

240
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,000
exist anymore it will become the

241
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,730
gift dl economy the gift economy where

242
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,730
everyone knew us and there were the tribes

243
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,470
that were formed  from 20 to 30 people

244
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,970
who with those fronts of lord of those who

245
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,910
knew each other and therefore everyone did

246
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,380
what he had to do to make himself

247
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,850
useful for this also keats was said to

248
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,410
find out how he went fishing is not

249
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,149
that to fish more less if before

250
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:57,500
that  his job was that he knew how to do

251
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,420
that he went to get the fish then

252
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,130
there was someone else who maybe knew how to

253
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,230
take the meat he knew everyone had

254
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,209
his ability impossible business however

255
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:08,060
to be to do the good of that of

256
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,529
that tribe

257
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:11,300
when it is born  the coin and the coin is

258
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,410
born when there is no longer this aspect

259
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,779
of trust and that is if for example I

260
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,089
a tribe meets another tribe you

261
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:18,860
are not sure that there will be

262
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,120
this cover

263
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,370
someone could give it a p  ò test

264
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,079
a certain amount of fish but you are not sure if he

265
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,880
could see the equivalent at least

266
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,649
as far as you consider of

267
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:30,740
meat value and this is one of the reasons then there is

268
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,180
also another aspect for example where

269
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,820
if one has to give to a cow and the  else

270
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,010
I have only two plus two and two fish it

271
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,899
is not that maybe

272
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,550
a cow can be easily divided because then the rest

273
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,649
of the cow can go bad and

274
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:45,050
then you go to create a need

275
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,250
because there is intra contact with the

276
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,959
compressors  where there is not a complete

277
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:52,010
long-term trust and precisely because

278
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,089
there may be situations it is not

279
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:55,670
easy to make an exchange a barter and

280
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,230
therefore you can look for an object that is

281
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,110
exchangeable and that can be accepted

282
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,970
even if one does not need it

283
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,920
myself to do it another example  than to see

284
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,480
how a coin can be born if

285
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,070
you think about prison channels

286
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,240
very often you want it becomes

287
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,640
cigarettes even if one does not smoke because

288
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,660
at that moment the most traded object is the one

289
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,700
and you when you are in ca  rcere

290
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,010
accept cigarettes not because he smokes fear

291
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,660
because you are sure that in the future

292
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,790
someone else will be able to accept them

293
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,130
and this is how the coin is born once upon a time

294
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,320
you could use salt there could

295
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,269
be twigs there have

296
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,029
shells example of stones then

297
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:31,190
evening also laurel and  generally there are

298
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,779
some characteristics that make

299
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:35,269
something whatever can become

300
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:38,420
money and they are the visibility the fact

301
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,160
that it is easy to carry the fact

302
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,920
that

303
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,160
the fact that it is fungible is maintained over time the fact that it

304
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,660
is fungible for example you think

305
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,640
when  consider like the coins

306
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,810
let's take the example of the coin of 2

307
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,709
euro and 2 euro

308
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,630
only slightly different but you are sure

309
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,029
that you can exchange one with the other

310
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:57,380
the amount of gold is also the same

311
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,690
if you always have a kg of gold thinking

312
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,000
that  he still has us perfect pure and

313
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,339
a car kg of gold are the same as you you

314
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:05,810
can download it with the other one follows

315
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,040
the other says but this flight this gold

316
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,890
here has more value  king of

317
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,820
the other people can give a

318
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,110
different value to them in reality it could

319
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,020
change we could try to have

320
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,209
those things where it is difficult for

321
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:18,529
a human being to give me a value of

322
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,360
more a greater value for example this

323
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,860
mound of gold one  you can tell this

324
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,270
mountain you like the woman more because

325
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,610
because she gave it to my brother

326
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,070
there must be something difficult to be

327
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,420
able to give a different value between

328
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,610
these objects and therefore he says the

329
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,920
fungibility then the fact that it must be

330
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,750
easily divisible and  precisely a

331
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,190
cow can hardly become a

332
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,910
coin

333
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,260
because if you want to divide it the

334
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,820
rest can go bad or

335
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,380
something else other things that according to the examples

336
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,190
I have done before easily

337
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,959
transportable a boulder is difficult to

338
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,910
transport instead the gold plus phase to be

339
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,260
transport or you can divide the

340
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,180
busy means of smaller and therefore in

341
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,949
addition to serious visible to make it

342
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:57,079
transport another thing is that you have to

343
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:58,610
m

344
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,350
salt was also used over time but in

345
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,820
any case if you prefer in general you

346
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,350
can prefer gold or in any case

347
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,390
something more than a stone because it is easier

348
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,160
to maintain over time because it

349
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,160
does not oxidize this may be a reason

350
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,350
or not  use even if for the cow

351
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,110
the cow is not suitable because it goes wrong

352
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,850
these characteristics listed the

353
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,310
more an object contains these

354
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,930
characteristics the easier it is

355
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,029
probable but not certain that it can

356
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:25,970
become the coin then returning the

357
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,290
bitcoin what characteristics the

358
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,810
bitcoin has the little ones and fungible also  if

359
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,940
digital you transferred a bitcoin from one

360
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,399
point to another it is also an elsewhere from

361
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,810
another peak and you know it but this one

362
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,700
pickaxe also the other a big one as one

363
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,810
you manage to give a higher value to the

364
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,860
other and therefore this is the

365
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,110
fungibility a bitcoin is divisible

366
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,660
even if you say 1 to 8 10 evils and therefore you

367
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,690
can make 0.001 bitcoins and therefore you

368
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,070
are not so type if we put that

369
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,380
bitcoins for  humans

370
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,660
agree to a social agreement to give it

371
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,339
a great value if you were not

372
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,019
visible or maybe one day the little one

373
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:01,190
could be worth 5 570 euros and

374
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,329
you want to go and buy bread you

375
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:03,800
cannot buy bread bitcoin you need

376
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,480
a passion coin if instead bitcoins

377
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,820
precisely it is divisible decimal plants

378
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,269
you want to buy with 0,000 hicks vico in

379
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:12,140
a piece of bread

380
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,570
then now I also add that the bitcoins

381
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,370
year to make it easier

382
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,100
they also defined me names at

383
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,240
various decimal levels

384
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,670
there are the microbes coin milly bitcoin

385
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,949
name  I remember which one so however it is a

386
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:27,079
bit like g in kg

387
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,940
there are questions now I have said a lot

388
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,529
of stuff questions about these things here

389
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:32,209
something that is missing something that is not

390
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:37,579
understandable then returning to bitcoin

391
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:40,130
precisely to different characteristics for

392
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,320
which it can be considered currency

393
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,029
beginning had no value the

394
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:46,850
first trades were for play or more

395
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,610
and the first real trade was to

396
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,899
buy a few  slopes

397
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,670
there is one who said themes buy a couple

398
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,130
of pizzas here with me apple green apples and

399
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,620
roms of take-away pizzas and then

400
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,120
sent bitcoins from one part of the

401
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,649
world to the other to oil some pizzas

402
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,149
specified an exchange

403
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,260
and from there  a value practically began to

404
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,060
form at that moment were

405
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,630
it seems to me 15,000 bitcoins for about 20 dollars

406
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,830
22 dollars

407
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,620
and someone started from there that

408
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,360
the value was born because it was considered

409
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,750
more value exchanges because

410
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,460
another always says vigliotti what

411
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,770
I said at the  'start and some city goes

412
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,960
the bitcoins not because they needed them but

413
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,130
knew that someone else

414
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,630
would accept them instead for some

415
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,990
thing maybe for another couple

416
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,250
of pizzas or what do I know to see

417
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,260
which alpaca houses what

418
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,560
cournooh are enslaved by now  and from then on,

419
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,820
the value began to drop,

420
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,170
there was certainly an agreement between

421
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,560
various people who agreed to

422
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,420
give value to this entity at this

423
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,040
value this n  number that I found on

424
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,810
this database then returning to it

425
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,640
how mining works and as if

426
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,380
it were everything because the bitcoin network is safe

427
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:10,710
when there are two entities

428
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,210
the inside of the three big ones there are no

429
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,050
nodes

430
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,670
at the beginning they were not joined then the  party

431
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,590
a specialization however there are

432
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:19,110
nodes and miners miners are also nodes

433
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,330
by force milan should necessarily be

434
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,620
in the exceptions but they should if

435
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,180
by force nodes the nodes are

436
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,070
sufficient those that connect

437
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,350
download all the database

438
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,420
of the coin network and  so when there is

439
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,910
someone else who tells him look I have

440
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,140
ten bitcoins sending to you and then in

441
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,140
exchange for something and he expects we tell

442
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,180
this person to accept them how can

443
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,530
you be sure since we are

444
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,780
still talking about something digital that this

445
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,670
person has not made a pair of

446
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,220
these bitcoins and that is that he had

447
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,080
imagined a file that at 10 bit with here

448
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,180
makes a copy I send him first and send to the

449
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,160
other and therefore can not

450
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,800
c  buy two things and this is thus

451
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,210
given the dub spending to this term

452
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,830
here in the second search on google

453
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,260
spending and find what you go to

454
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,410
prevent dublin spending he underwent coin the

455
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,940
database certifies this

456
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,069
security and that is if I have ten

457
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,920
bitcoins to him I can  also do another

458
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,780
transaction where I send another ten big ones

459
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,260
afloat

460
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,829
but the other will say no I us your

461
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,240
bogus transaction because they have already been

462
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,459
sent to the other and in this way you

463
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,310
avoid the dublin spending

464
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,959
how do you give back is what here

465
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,880
through mining then as mentioned before there

466
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,400
are the nodes that go to download that

467
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,600
connect they go to download the whole

468
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,400
database of all transactions

469
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,850
the database made of blocks there are

470
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,430
every these blocks on average every 10

471
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,440
minutes and of the three blocks there are totti

472
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,190
of transactions when you with a node

473
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,650
made a transaction is of you I want to

474
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,220
send xb coin to the other person

475
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,870
you are following a transaction

476
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,550
this action will be the start a

477
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,490
transaction not with  stop and you can make

478
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,230
all the unconfirmed transactions you

479
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,090
want you can send food with tenths to him

480
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,740
with the other of cpi core you can

481
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,420
send you have 10 b with database slot and

482
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,610
you can send all of you 10 bitcoins

483
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,160
with, however, the next block will happen

484
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,260
only one of these transactions

485
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,770
will be confirmed and this from here is a

486
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,540
job that miners do make you

487
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,100
defined my miner not because they go to

488
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,400
beat 21 mines but because it is

489
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,500
considered that bitcoin as

490
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,720
economic laws works very similar to

491
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,300
them because for example  limited

492
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,920
now what I said before

493
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,600
most the number of pickaxes that can be

494
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,180
created from here to eternity will be 21

495
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,130
million means that there will never be

496
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,200
more than 21 million bitcoins the

497
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,120
similarity with them is that we didn't

498
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,440
really know  how much they are

499
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,940
inside the world but we are sure that a

500
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,000
limited quantity and therefore for this reason we

501
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,170
are also defined that bitcoins

502
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,440
tend to be, even if not the  or it is time they

503
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,480
will be method and factual and that is that over

504
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,330
time it will increase in value it is not said

505
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,480
that now so because in any case the small ones

506
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,520
are generated every 10 minutes the certain

507
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,260
amount and therefore let's say there is a

508
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,630
continuous inflation of the mister coin

509
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,880
is generated again

510
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,270
so in order not to lose the thread I said

511
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,980
that the work that the miner

512
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,560
does who checks the transactions

513
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,070
the miners we are before seeing that

514
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,200
bitcoins are similar to

515
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
that they are defined that they go to mine in does a job of

516
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,590
mining and the miners do it a job

517
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,140
even if they do not physically do it

518
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,190
with theirs

519
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,539
they have computers that do calculations

520
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:33,789
and therefore making calculations

521
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:36,240
continuously they make an energy cost

522
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,799
the energy has a cost and therefore you

523
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,450
have to pay in one way or you will pay it

524
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,669
with another coin  or by

525
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,580
offering what I know about the product of

526
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,159
your garden or by making you, that is, in

527
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,499
any case it takes a cover

528
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,539
a job that you are doing for this

529
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:54,720
I say there is a job an  that if the

530
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,149
on energy is to be paid practically in the

531
00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:59,679
past you could also think not now

532
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,169
to be putting the bicycle with the

533
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:04,179
dynamo and going to mine to create

534
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:06,309
energy to make the computer that

535
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:09,820
made these calculations work however what

536
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,639
the miner does calculations  then first of all

537
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:14,980
he as I said before the miners are

538
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,990
also the nodes they receive all

539
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,149
the transactions and go to complete

540
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:21,279
compile a block to give an example

541
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,690
imagine the blogs as a text file

542
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,019
or as an excel sheet is a

543
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:29,919
metaphor they had to indicate it has been  the

544
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,570
transaction from dude to who sent

545
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,249
ixquick dude b

546
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:35,289
the transaction from dude to that to

547
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:38,529
others from coin to dude cpp coin and is

548
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,299
putting within this void

549
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:44,200
excelsa moment this small block of

550
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,450
data the unconfirmed transactions that

551
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,799
he is receiving in  that moment on the

552
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:48,309
network

553
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:50,440
before i said all that i could

554
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,730
start a lot and conoco tradition

555
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,509
stops to you

556
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:54,399
then there are other small users

557
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,230
so c  'is the other hesitates the other

558
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,999
will try that which will do again and we

559
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:00,759
make transactions and all

560
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,899
these actions are all repeat

561
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:03,879
unconfirmed transactions then

562
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:07,570
eliminator still takes this block

563
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,009
and starts filling it admits of all

564
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,899
these unconfirmed transactions

565
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:12,249
besides this  miner there is one more

566
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:13,840
and another is still another

567
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,119
miners are all competition with

568
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:18,220
each other because they have to want to get there

569
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,119
first to find the block

570
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,919
first i said the block was

571
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:24,730
too fast

572
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,740
there is one  average of blocks that come out every

573
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,519
10 minutes and every 10 minutes means that

574
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:32,139
he was a miner among all those who

575
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:33,879
work, it is not known how many there are and

576
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:36,340
anyone can enter to be a miner,

577
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,960
but practically other costs are needed

578
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,490
now

579
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,820
as a tc business miner and it is  the first one who

580
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,830
manages to find the block will win a

581
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,780
prize

582
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,920
then found the one I said before all

583
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,150
those minder go to put together

584
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,790
all the confirmed transactions

585
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,980
they have  found and there is never an

586
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,580
open in 2003 that each one

587
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,220
individually compiles this block of theirs at the

588
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,530
end the last transaction I put is

589
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,750
different among all

590
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,450
of them each of them will tell me why on the

591
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,850
merit

592
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,640
now only 12.5 bitcoins so  I repeat to

593
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,780
me they are all the

594
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,370
unconfirmed but that they are the same trans dealings

595
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,050
are confirmed those who said they

596
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,130
are not forced to be the same among

597
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,590
everyone but more or less on the

598
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,850
network

599
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,350
jim all these confirmed nations

600
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,400
so more or less everyone knows

601
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,170
them  and then they go to complete

602
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,390
this block at the bottom they write

603
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,890
I deserved lady cpb things I

604
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,820
have to go to my address

605
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,559
then there is the other miner who has

606
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,540
completed his blog wrote to my address

607
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,230
I have to go 12.5 bitcoin is  so

608
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,080
everyone else does the work

609
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,660
they do and find lush of this

610
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,390
block and for those who do not know what it is

611
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,650
born they must find leaves of this

612
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,650
block which is the shadow 156 of the chateau

613
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,950
156 com  unque left 156 that must

614
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,600
respect a certain rule

615
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,150
there must be a total of zeros in front of

616
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,500
this rule is another value that

617
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,429
shared within the whole

618
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:03,960
network we

619
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,740
imagine at this moment the network

620
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,230
says we accept that is all nodes

621
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,240
say we do not accept blocks  that

622
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,960
they have difficulty 4 difficulty 4

623
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,370
means that there must be

624
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,040
four zeros in front of the match of the

625
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,610
block so let's go back there is the

626
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,380
miner one who has compiled the block

627
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,270
it says at the bottom this is my

628
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,790
address and I want 12,  5 bitcoins and

629
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,010
you start to calculate leaves is proof that

630
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,679
a cd comes out three zeros is not good

631
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:35,650
as it does to find another ash you

632
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,780
have a random number in front of it is a

633
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,370
set of data and at the bottom it puts the

634
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,670
value 1 calculation to the trash or they come  two

635
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,530
zeros not good there you have the value two

636
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,650
come 10 not good puts value 3

637
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,050
4 5 6 but putting random values

638
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:50,830
in front of it

639
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,540
until you come up with an ace that has

640
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,110
these four

641
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,150
zeros qu  this job he is doing

642
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,710
I am doing it another miner the other one to

643
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,850
send still everyone is doing

644
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,830
it there is no certainty of knowing

645
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,450
exactly what the value he

646
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,780
finds is called mons and that is the

647
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,270
random value to put in front of all

648
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,549
these  set of data that the block to

649
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:12,520
find you that with four zeros in front

650
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,920
you know there is no certainty but you know if

651
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,510
they have a greater probability if you have

652
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,120
a greater computing power so

653
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,280
if you have more more powerful computers you can

654
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,929
do calculations faster then  it is

655
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:25,690
more likely that you are able to

656
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,059
find the block before a than other

657
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:30,100
miners.

658
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,720


659
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,120


660
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,620


661
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,350


662
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,510
it might

663
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,480
succeed that after this I will explain to you

664
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,929
later however it has that when miner

665
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:51,010
finds the block it finds lush with the

666
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,559
four zeros if it fixes it and  at 4

667
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,850
let's say look look I found the

668
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,350
block I stretch the block and the go and

669
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,690
block to the nodes to which it is connected and the

670
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,610
other known I say do it check and to

671
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,020
do a birth check very

672
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,330
soon it is difficult to find the incorrect

673
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,130
putting of random numbers but

674
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,010
once you have the random number the number

675
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,960
the nos in front which could be 45 a

676
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,880
value and the data is easy to

677
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,380
calculate so the node does not have to do

678
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,850
all the work that the miners did in

679
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,530
minder it takes on average ten minutes to

680
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,970
find that  block while the node

681
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,260
receives the block does the check in

682
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,370
half a second

683
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,290
and is able to know if that block is

684
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,380
correct and then all of us

685
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,880
receive the block they say they

686
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,160
check and if it is correct they

687
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,669
add it to their database

688
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:35,230
the database is  in fact b col is called

689
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,330
block chain maybe someone has heard

690
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,820
this number here this this this

691
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,500
name here because just a chain of

692
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,080
blocks the block every blog that is

693
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,760
connected that  the first reality in fact

694
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,780
inside the blind block milk

695
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,000
information there is the leave of the

696
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,900
previous block and what happens then that to

697
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,750
find the solution miner once he

698
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,070
managed to find also the axis of

699
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,809
this block and its block is

700
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:05,169
confirmed ends  on all the

701
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:06,730
nodes of the bitcoin network

702
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,190
and what was written at the bottom of the block

703
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,980
it says I deserved 12.5

704
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,140
bitcoins this address he

705
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,570
put here so again I explained

706
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,720
before inside his wallet

707
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,429
how to  all the users of the

708
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:24,280
coin network he created bank accounts

709
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,590
that are bitcoin addresses and among

710
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,120
these he created one that he had put at the

711
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,770
bottom of the transaction because he put

712
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,210
inside his block to indicate

713
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,970
I deserved 12.5 bitcoins so it is  born

714
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,590
this block that ended up

715
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,240
in all the databases of all the

716
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,010
nodes in which it is written that on those

717
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,049
addresses there are 12 05 bitcoins

718
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:42,490
so for all

719
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:47,110
that bier miner now at 12  , 5 bitcoins and this is

720
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,200
how bitcoins are generated here

721
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:58,990
questions there is something that one cannot

722
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,070
write what he wants

723
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,590
so I deserved a top but what

724
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,640
happens that inside

725
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,140
the node that is extracted by the user

726
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,880
there are rules  written above a

727
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,150
software know how it works and then

728
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,130
comes a blog here it says i

729
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,679
deserved 100 100 small to say but

730
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:17,290
right now there is the node says these

731
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,940
are not the correct rules so

732
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,130
the box is ignored enough this

733
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,720
then  the meyer can write whatever

734
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,190
the inside of the node wants so that the

735
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,049
reign of all the ways it can happen

736
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:29,500
that maybe one goes to download the

737
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,860
bitcoin client from a bogus site from a

738
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,020
wrong site not the original one so

739
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,970
with different rules and he  he will be

740
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,580
the only one who looks for that ringlets

741
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,990
so he adapts himself to download a

742
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,280
bogus software could be

743
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,520
scammed in some way and

744
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,929
this will happen but he hygiene like these

745
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:48,669
bitcoin centers is stat  or paid in some

746
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:51,190
way by the miner then at some point he will

747
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,929
say that he is inside his

748
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:55,360
database and send them another

749
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,760
way the node that does not have that block there

750
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,990
because he has ignored it the other no

751
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,179
of the admired will say these children  bb

752
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,309
decrease will never receive so example I

753
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:04,630
have received these 100 bitcoins and I want to

754
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,120
buy myself a car I am the scammed

755
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,130
the bitcoin to him who sells me the

756
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,870
car he did not receive these b with

757
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,090
i am waiting marine seen bitcoin

758
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,980
he will never accept them because according to him

759
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,570
I  these little ones do not there the works that

760
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,100
in its database that looks at all the

761
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,250
others

762
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,990
does not exist does not have it has been ignored

763
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:26,120
hicks months before maybe let's see

764
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,700
the other things now then that's why it

765
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,630
is on average every 10 minutes a block the

766
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,030
nodes check  also how often it comes out how often

767
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,680
the speed in which e

768
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,390
revisions blocks

769
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,550
if for example the blocks start to

770
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,140
come out in my e of 9 minutes and of 8

771
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,130
minutes they automatically after a

772
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,150
totti the moods of b  locchi that

773
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,950
correspond in about two weeks

774
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,090
I don't remember what the precise value

775
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,910
however the nodes count in blocks even

776
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,620
if even if more or less it is two

777
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,780
weeks they see that in 200

778
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,160
weeks the blocks have started to

779
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,590
come out on average of 8 seconds

780
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,150
then all  those who received

781
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,100
the block faster will say if

782
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,810
our difficulty was 3

783
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,010
we will now throw blocks with

784
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,710
difficulty 4 and in this way it means

785
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,270
that all of the miners who first

786
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,860
could find blocks

787
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,720
easily much easier than others perhaps

788
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,170
jerome miners who had  bought some

789
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,520
computers much more powerful than the others

790
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,790
so he could have them faster they will be

791
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,900
horrified we do not want to accept

792
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,030
this speed here and therefore we will assist

793
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,400
with difficulty 4 or 5

794
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,010
in short, a greater difficulty and therefore

795
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,150
everyone will be forced to

796
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,440
work harder because it becomes more

797
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,120
difficult to find  an ex that has

798
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,060
four zeros instead of 3 or five

799
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,950
zeros instead  4 and therefore they do not have to

800
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,630
work harder for this reason the difficulty

801
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,180
increases the inverse can also happen and

802
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,740
that is the blocks begin to come out on

803
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,980
average every 12 minutes every 20 minutes

804
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,930
then they will tell me the nodes states

805
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,370
stanley blocks we are receiving too

806
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,900
slowly and therefore we now

807
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,810
we will look for difficulty 3 instead of 4

808
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,910
after two weeks of blocks have passed

809
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:02,000
this thing here would be for

810
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,770
another reason also to maintain a

811
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,020
certain economic regularity a way in

812
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,810
which the coin is generated

813
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,000
means that every 10 minutes as I said

814
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,740
before there is a  miner who wins these in b

815
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,750
coin I also try to say that there is

816
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,370
inflation there is the coin there is a certain number

817
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,450
of coins that are placed on the market

818
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,270
and we try to respect this speed

819
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,090
and that is every touch in 10 minutes for how

820
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,549
video you immediately get the

821
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:27,769
ibi bitcoins on the network we started that

822
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:29,779
the beginning there were 50 years ten minutes

823
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:32,509
after about four years always calculated

824
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:34,519
in the quantity of wind blocks there is the

825
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:36,799
halving c  and there are 25

826
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:37,639
this year there has been another

827
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,320
halving and currently

828
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,929
12.5 bitcoins are received by

829
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:44,110
miners every 10 minutes means that every 10 minutes

830
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,929
other sweet 5 coins enter the market and

831
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,179
this is the inflation that exists

832
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:52,549
within the coin network and this

833
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:56,629
thing will go on until 1200 1140

834
00:30:56,629 --> 00:30:58,669
approximately in reality the units will end up

835
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:01,909
taking them in 2030 however, however the

836
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:04,009
mining up to 10 to 10 at

837
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:05,809
the smallest decimals will reach up to

838
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:11,739
1.140 approximately 2012 2140 other questions here

839
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:15,230
it is not all inclusive

840
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:22,580
there is something that is okay let's see

841
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:29,690
what other things you are talking about

842
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,749
how we say bitcoin is issued in

843
00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:34,669
some way it is put in a

844
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:36,679
way like never as you specified

845
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:38,960
on a very regular basis and even

846
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,850
there  a lot of this regularity is held

847
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:41,539


848
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:44,179
if the argument is that then above the

849
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:45,919
bitcoin let's say an economy is developing

850
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,799
in this case the supply

851
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:54,259
of bitcoin remains constant but above

852
00:31:54,259 --> 00:32:00,999
the economy it has ups and downs.  lto

853
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:04,970
very heavy we say therefore usually

854
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,200
a currency in some way should or

855
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,809
could follow the trend of

856
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:13,789
its economy

857
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:17,059
in this case the bitcoin follows its

858
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:20,210
own trend and the economy above

859
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,669
bitcoin instead of

860
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:28,249
very and very volatile trends ok ok then c  'it is

861
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:29,779
an advantage or disadvantage in this thing

862
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:32,090
here and that is if for example we say that the

863
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,190
little ones began to try to follow it

864
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,080
monet the economy first of all we need to

865
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,460
see if how easy it is to achieve

866
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,230
this thing here and above all to

867
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,960
realize it in a way between stress and that is

868
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,610
where there is no need for the intervention of

869
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,929
a human being because we return to

870
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,340
think that there is a human being who can

871
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,260
intervene to regulate we also

872
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,350
put regular laresca to regulate the bitcoin output

873
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:54,200
correctly and in a better way.

874
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,330
a human being

875
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,070
who does it that can be that a saint

876
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,990
their saints when whoever is there

877
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,450
after him dies or if he goes crazy tomorrow

878
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,760
or turns badly turned badly  because

879
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,559
without finding the morning back in

880
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,720
fashion it will give confidence to a human being and

881
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,370
therefore it may be that it goes well but not

882
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,240
forever which the advantage that the

883
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,860
bie con is regular is that

884
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,110
everyone knows that it is so regular and therefore everyone

885
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,179
can adjust to it  to this if

886
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:22,850
even tomorrow if therefore everyone knows that

887
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,260
there is that speed it is a constant value

888
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,389
and based on these an evaluation must be made

889
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:28,370
on the market

890
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:31,370
is a constant value on which if instead it were

891
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,809
based that there is a human being beyond  there

892
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:35,510
that or there was also some kind of

893
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,769
artificial intelligence they don't try to

894
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:38,269
imagine you ac now I try to

895
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:40,730
eat something more trash cles however it still

896
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,139
means that there is someone who has made

897
00:33:42,139 --> 00:33:44,539
the decision he has for the future and

898
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:47,659
everything is wrong as he is

899
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,789
thought a certain speed is turned

900
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:51,649
this the coin I need and I sit

901
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:53,000
in this speed here that the economy

902
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,710
goes like this but it may be that

903
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,690
someone else is uncomfortable so you get the

904
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,820
headings in the ficiale says  we need

905
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,289
to change it a little bit because otherwise

906
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:02,000
someone could have some problems

907
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,600
but go and marry all the

908
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,760
economic bases that has plus a business plan

909
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,469
that someone had made

910
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,020
so instead of simple more you

911
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,010
prefer in this in reality you

912
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,929
could also maybe not  I would like to say

913
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:15,949
that it is not possible to do this thing here

914
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,599
because a pb coins the first project that is

915
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,310
carried out in this sense so it may

916
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,449
be that somehow someone

917
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:21,830
can also create something

918
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,149
more decentralized with

919
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:25,668
artificial intense but the advantage is that the

920
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:27,710
bitcoin is this  certainty and that is that

921
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,030
the rules are these

922
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,940
no one can change them and based

923
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,859
on these here the rest if the price goes up it

924
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:35,780
goes down

925
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,280
there are those who are there there is also another thing

926
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,440
that should be evaluated coin is a

927
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,400
very small market  currently I

928
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,469
respect the rest of the world and

929
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,960
therefore necessarily it is very

930
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,510
easy to have a high volatility

931
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,699
but it is thought that in the future this thing

932
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,530
can go to change at least both

933
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,120
this idea that the more the market

934
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,219
becomes bigger the less volatile bitcoin will become

935
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,850
and therefore it is better said the type

936
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,530
of count of speculators in reality it is

937
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,030
always that its creator to increase

938
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,980
so that the presented more stable because it

939
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,660
means that  when there is a sculptor

940
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,370
who hopes that the price will go down there is

941
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,480
another one instead who hopes that soon

942
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,940
saga maybe because of their interest in

943
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,850
another for another type of

944
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,500
market research they have to do they have little

945
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,820
interest that it will go down which  it is interesting that it

946
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,830
rises more to increase with the actors

947
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,660
on one side on the other, the more these

948
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,950
changes should go to sea to

949
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,440
decrease there is this idea, let's say then we

950
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,930
need to see if it can be confirmed but you

951
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,250
can go and see that

952
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,490
the work tends to evaluate it and  trita of

953
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,650
bitcoin is more or less going to decline

954
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,720
over time indeed it seems to me that in reality it is

955
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,280
also less volatile than other

956
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,110
state currencies that there is within

957
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,670
the world.  I cease the statistic

958
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,860
towards it does not hide behind it is here

959
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:54,110
if I understood correctly after ten minutes

960
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,210
the transaction is confirmed

961
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,090
then after it is not said then you must

962
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,500
always i yes it is not said that it is from

963
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,060
this then there is a thing called

964
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,160
man pool  that is indicated to all

965
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,630
transactions or confirmed that run on the

966
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,140
network

967
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,880
let's put in this moment there are 2

968
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,170
thousand unconfirmed transactions on the

969
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:10,560
network it

970
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,630
means that all the nodes plus and miners

971
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,340
have these 2000 and unconfirmed transactions

972
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,020
within their of

973
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,330
their ram  and they have to make a choice

974
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,460
to see how many transactions to put

975
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,200
inside their block they can put

976
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,600
one they can put from scratch it takes

977
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,940
so long their promises metals there is not one

978
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,350
thing I have to say in fact they can

979
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,670
decide how many transactions to put

980
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,260
inside this block and it can be

981
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,450
that one always remains out example there is

982
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,180
only 2001 and the blue and the dcn miner I put

983
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,590
two milan this one here nolan and it stays

984
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:37,950
out

985
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,860
means that all  transactions

986
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,290
will receive the first confirmation instead

987
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,060
the last one they have not been confirmed

988
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,920
perhaps probably will receive the confirmation

989
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,780
in the next block

990
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,610
there are two things I must say indeed

991
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,340
then the miner does not earn only

992
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,700
from the prize that the grapes indicate or

993
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,850
I deserve these 12  , 5 bitcoins all the

994
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,990
transactions you make within the

995
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,430
small network you also have to pay a

996
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,500
small commission and this commission

997
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,970
is to avoid spam

998
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,680
because otherwise if there were not this

999
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,210
small commission there would be someone

1000
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,070
an evil entity in the negative tranche that

1001
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,200
would make a  infinity indeed the

1002
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,490
possible infinity of transactions to try to

1003
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,780
get clogged up as much as the network

1004
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,070
if instead there is also a small

1005
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,660
commission infinity is not possible anyway it

1006
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,400
means that if one has a

1007
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,870
beat coin anyway sooner or later studies

1008
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,240
neck ends and therefore  he put this

1009
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,970
commission here first to avoid

1010
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:30,390
spam

1011
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,850
on the network and in addition to pay the

1012
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,600
miners

1013
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,940
the miners then receive  the

1014
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,330
bitcoin prize plus the sum of the commissions

1015
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,920
of the transactions that they have entered

1016
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,360
within the block that have

1017
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,180
confirmed that they have found not only

1018
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,250
when they end up with the prize

1019
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,020
as mentioned, the bitcoins are the maximum of

1020
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,760
1 million certain point they end up because

1021
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,050
mina tordino continue  to do this

1022
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,180
work they do it because by

1023
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,010
confirming the transactions they receive

1024
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,270
again the sum of all the transactions

1025
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,670
all the commissions that are

1026
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,650
within those traditions that

1027
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,750
have confirmed so I repeat we

1028
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,220
get there a point of vika they are no longer

1029
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,130
generated I am the  miner I passed I

1030
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,960
found leaves of a block concept

1031
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,150
transactions every different treatment a certain

1032
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,100
amount of commissions I add

1033
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,080
this is what I earned and therefore

1034
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,820
the incentive for reminder remains to

1035
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,560
work in a way it does not do it for

1036
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,440
miners so it is not that they work

1037
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,420
maybe  we can do that goodness but it is never

1038
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,650
from a job to mount it they do for

1039
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,590
greed in miner check it works and  he does

1040
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,090
this job here of control because he

1041
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,160
wants to earn he will not do it on his teeth

1042
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,020
for goodness he wants to earn it so

1043
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,940
the incentive lies in his

1044
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,310
greed bitcoin works thanks

1045
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:48,030
to greed yes how the commission is calculated

1046
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,340
because in the wants I see that

1047
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,680
there is the  low commission let's say the

1048
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
average commission the high commission

1049
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,760
in the commission that I can specify

1050
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,240
ok then things have changed a bit

1051
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,770
lately and there is also a big

1052
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:02,309
debate

1053
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:03,900
now I don't want to pull in because

1054
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,930
afterwards there is too much to talk about but

1055
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,829
currently the commissions are

1056
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:10,079
calculated more or less on the basis of how

1057
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,109
large the transaction is but not how much it

1058
00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:14,999
transmits, i.e. if for example it transmits

1059
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:16,529
a bitcoin one hundred bitcoins a million

1060
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:18,959
peak in is one thing but on how

1061
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,339
large the transaction is in space

1062
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:21,059


1063
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,609
if for example I transfer a bitcoin

1064
00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:27,420
it is this bitcoin it is the set of

1065
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,680
transactions you can also combine

1066
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,390
multiple addresses so for example if I have

1067
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,849
twenty addresses where they are d  distributed a certain number

1068
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:34,529
of pickaxe in the middle and the sum makes a

1069
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:36,569
nick coin I can make the transaction

1070
00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:38,130
indicate I take all these addresses

1071
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,660
here the sum of these small ones here

1072
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,119
and sending somewhere else

1073
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,079
are many addresses it means that

1074
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,489
transactions when you go  to write them

1075
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:46,439
larger and therefore it may be that you go to

1076
00:39:46,439 --> 00:39:47,759
pay a higher commission

1077
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:49,559
than the commission ii you move from

1078
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,979
one address only 100 100 thousand bitcoins

1079
00:39:52,979 --> 00:39:55,289
to the other address but it will

1080
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:57,119
pay a higher commission

1081
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,890
first when I intercept only one  because

1082
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,469
writing just the as the

1083
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:04,049
largest text transaction and because you are going to

1084
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:05,699
do a calculation based on the kilobytes

1085
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:07,289
because precisely to the rare resource

1086
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:09,449
the whole of the network is currently also

1087
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,039
the blocks as they are written on the

1088
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,109
software has a maximum size of one

1089
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:15,179
megabyte means that it is a certain

1090
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,729
point the temptations become too many to

1091
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:19,229
enter the block because

1092
00:40:19,229 --> 00:40:20,789
there is no software space in this they

1093
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:21,239
lie

1094
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:23,309
as I said  first the nodes if then also

1095
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:24,929
create a block of 2 mag and 3 media

1096
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:27,869
but the node that within the as

1097
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:30,089
written receives this block

1098
00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:31,920
here when it arrives it sees that over a mega

1099
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,289
does not accept it then ignores it so the miner

1100
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:35,910
who wants instead  get

1101
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,319
his block accepted because in the

1102
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:38,609
box written that he has a prize he wants

1103
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:40,229
this prize here

1104
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,769
he has to decide how much m3 inside and if

1105
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:45,569
for example you want to be sure you have

1106
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,609
a transaction in the first

1107
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:49,469
possible blocks then he had put the

1108
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:51,150
highest commission and  so if there are

1109
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:51,900
there is a limit

1110
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,249
let's say that inside the block there are a

1111
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:55,380
maximum of 100 transactions and yours has

1112
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,309
paid 0.00 xxv coin and others have

1113
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:01,709
paid more than regiments more and those

1114
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,939
the maximum orders of traditions that

1115
00:41:02,939 --> 00:41:03,989
can fit inside the  block from a

1116
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:06,179
mega they accept in maider I say I

1117
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:07,709
sure what I want drives more money

1118
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:11,459
and then that when you see them the

1119
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:13,529
commission tends to be an

1120
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:15,119
automatic solution is based on how much

1121
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:15,810


1122
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:18,990
the transaction is big but you say I want one

1123
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,020
I want to pay

1124
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,370
more the highest commission I would pay

1125
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:26,040
more there is one more thing now the big ones and

1126
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,210
you want to do another check too

1127
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,400
check how it was how were the

1128
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,990
previous commissions of the previous transactions

1129
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,970
try a little to guess how

1130
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:33,990
at that moment the

1131
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,090
network situation and based on this then if they

1132
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,590
make you pay more that is it may be

1133
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,770
that maybe you are expecting two or three blocks of

1134
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,850
all the blocks maybe it will cost you

1135
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:45,990
less or a little time I would also  show

1136
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,310
one thing in promoted it is said to see

1137
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,980
sirci seeing the little ones then was the

1138
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,660
first but perhaps many know it at the

1139
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,550
moment of the wanted roof there

1140
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,880
are a lot of them there are hundreds of them

1141
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,110
who are all competing with each

1142
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,030
other the little ones in that instrument a

1143
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,490
most of the volume on now

1144
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,480
we speak that the market in general is

1145
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,540
around 11.5 million

1146
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,860
not billion dollars at the dollar exchange rate

1147
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,130
and this while bitcoin dominates 79

1148
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,460
percent of the whole market

1149
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,990
and you can see all these currencies

1150
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,180
here that even these are wanted more

1151
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,910
or less decentralized some are a bit of a

1152
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,220
scam escape but most

1153
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,330
have this idea of being

1154
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:30,270
decentralized and between stress and are in

1155
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,590
competition with each other.  them and also with

1156
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,360
bitcoin and therefore there are those who trade

1157
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,880
with these indeed you see the point that the

1158
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,280
value changes could go and

1159
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,950
trade these here so not many

1160
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,450
do even 3d in this sense because

1161
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,910
they do not use the euro there is the  'euro they use it to

1162
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,350
go and buy bitcoins and then they don't

1163
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,270
come out anymore they remain learning how to

1164
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:50,820
train france yesterday a memory of

1165
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,710
these here and they try to earn very

1166
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,300
often generally I go back to chord which

1167
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,980
is considered safer but

1168
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,330
said it could also move  on the

1169
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:00,240
others if you go to learn

1170
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,800
how these environments work, here you could

1171
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,300
actually identify what will be the

1172
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,620
next destination that will take the place of

1173
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,610
coin

1174
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:06,990
I am very much seen  di micol I hope it

1175
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,820
does not happen but you may be

1176
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,440
right and discover that the other coin

1177
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,050
that the black man steam is the real currency

1178
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,790
of the future and will take the place of

1179
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,860
bitcoin so you go buy

1180
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,480
this coin here the value goes up you

1181
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,160
also become rich and  you have

1182
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,290
identified your knowledge coast

1183
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,610
intuition has made you understand in that

1184
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:26,280
better coin and you have made more

1185
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,110
money more you have identified which is the

1186
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,290
future coin

1187
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,560
that will technologically

1188
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,330
help humanity

1189
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,470
how many questions everything I have

1190
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,360
explained before here is a  world of things

1191
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,990
to say but not when I can know

1192
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,270
then if my transaction becomes

1193
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:46,630
confirmed the is a time but there is

1194
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,000
a maximum time or pop for absurdity it

1195
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,890
could happen in a case where it can

1196
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,110
then if you put a transaction on

1197
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:55,780
commission  zero or very low it can

1198
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,340
happen that the totalization remains

1199
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,930
in pool c within the range of

1200
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:00,400
all nodes for a young day

1201
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,420
three days at some point fri  ga

1202
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,280
deleted and therefore it will never be

1203
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,800
confirmed and as it is never confirmed

1204
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,880
useful that competes b when neither how

1205
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,980
nor but sent it means that for the

1206
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,270
databases of all your little ones they

1207
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,910
are still lived address and it may

1208
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:13,900
happen that the transactions

1209
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,490
possibly c 1 hour 2  hours three hours

1210
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,410
even one day more you increase the

1211
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,640
commission more false that will be

1212
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,650
confirmed in advance

1213
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,540
however it is understood well meter b with

1214
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,790
yanez rotas between stress and peer to peer and it

1215
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,110
means that there is no entity that

1216
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,220
can control

1217
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,270
the advantage  of this that you see

1218
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,040
anyone paying in any other part

1219
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,180
of the world as long as there is an

1220
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,590
internet connection

1221
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,060
there is no entity a

1222
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,830
police state anything else that unless

1223
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:36,790
you get to point the gun

1224
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,010
at you is not able  to block

1225
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,960
their see a transaction there and they

1226
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,840
can do nothing to block it

1227
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,430
returning to the case where I send

1228
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:48,730
my 10 bitcoins to all to 100 people

1229
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,100
if there who wins that tran  sation can

1230
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,560
go at random it can go quite chance

1231
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,990
but once one learned how a

1232
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,160
sane in the network

1233
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,690
he knows it well everyone sees

1234
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:00,280
this unconfirmed temptation

1235
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,330
no one has to accept the

1236
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:04,000
unconfirmed transaction someone actually is

1237
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,530
among the confirmed tradition because if

1238
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,720
let's say an agreement between mutual agreement

1239
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,220
between people for example if you go

1240
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,810
to buy bread somewhere and

1241
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:13,060
the other 7 bitcoins you want I had to go

1242
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,730
even he would say for you to do it

1243
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,920
stefania between 0 confirmed and when

1244
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,870
you look away from there he will receive that  the

1245
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:21,700
transaction was canceled but he

1246
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,410
remembers your face is a bit like

1247
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,030
going to check back with your

1248
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,580
credit card and so let's say there are no

1249
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,110
situations where maybe it is difficult to

1250
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:30,460
do this type of scam but in

1251
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,840
general when you accept  with

1252
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,130
bitcoin barriers you always have to

1253
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,270
wait for at least the first

1254
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,970
confirmation to arrive there is the other thing to say that it is important that it

1255
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,270
has a cost to find the block

1256
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,650
for  ri miner can cost several million

1257
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:45,800
several million euros this means

1258
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,130
however that one could a minder could

1259
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,300
also try to go back in

1260
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,900
time and that is to go to peck the

1261
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,370
previous blocks and calculate

1262
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:56,390
differently should do a big

1263
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,800
job have a big power of

1264
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,660
calculation being able to do it is to go back

1265
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,520
however it means that it has to calculate a

1266
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,720
block of blocks three blocks year

1267
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,070
costs many other entities it seems exponential to me to

1268
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,720
go back but it

1269
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,970
could also try to do it so

1270
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,620
if there are sites that show more or

1271
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,090
less what the calculation is  to find a

1272
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:12,830
block and to find two blocks in a

1273
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,530
row and this I try to guess to

1274
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,750
know how many coffees you have

1275
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,640
to wait if for example you have to buy a house

1276
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,590
that costs several million may be the

1277
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:24,410
confirmation not enough because the guy

1278
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:27,560
who is going to buy you the house and  is

1279
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,240
sending you the bitcoins for the contract for

1280
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,890
a rope even if we are one thing the

1281
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:34,460
maybe better house but let's put ch  and

1282
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,260
I want to find myself at home he could

1283
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,210
go and ask minder and say I'm going

1284
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:40,100
to buy a house that should

1285
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,330
cost millions

1286
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:44,360
I pay you as I know the tenth which in

1287
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,800
any case much more than the cost

1288
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,260
maybe of the block to try to undermine

1289
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,180
a different one than the  first the first

1290
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,340
sensation confirmed to calculate two

1291
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:56,270
blocks in a row and then cancel

1292
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:57,500
my confirmed transaction so

1293
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,030
not even the trans and the confirmed ones can

1294
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:01,610
be completely safe simulated

1295
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,840
agreeing more or less what the cost is

1296
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,760
to cancel several blocks knows how many

1297
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,810
confirmations

1298
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,340
are generally needed however  maximum security if

1299
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,780
I confirm it means that it has a

1300
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,520
disproportionate cost for a miner it goes

1301
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,530
back six blocks and therefore if these confirmations are

1302
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,310
safe dates,

1303
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,170
however, for everything you had to buy,

1304
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,420
consider in cost to find a

1305
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,310
block of the similar euro in

1306
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,900
everything that  costs less than 10 million euros

1307
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,180
and you can accept even one

1308
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,480
confirmation.

1309
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,130
I would like to know if p

1310
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:31,640
bitcoin editing is reversible or not

1311
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,500
more or less what an

1312
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,390
unconfirmed transaction does

1313
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:36,920
not exist as a temptation other than

1314
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,390
a reporter who is not that has not ended up

1315
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,250
on the database and therefore there may be

1316
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,110
many others a bitcoin transaction

1317
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,930
can be reversible if

1318
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,630
it is valid if the cost to stay goes

1319
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:51,230
has never happened this is what however if cox and it

1320
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:53,450
costs a block to make 10 thousand euros for

1321
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,430
example it is the scam allows you to

1322
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:56,000
earn one

1323
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,380
million and the mind could try to

1324
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,340
make two blocks in a row that

1325
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,640
can cost it  100 thousand euros because it

1326
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,320
would allow him to earn

1327
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,300
a million from the counterpart so we have to

1328
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,600
see what the cost to do xbox is

1329
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,100
below and based on these decide

1330
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,890
how many confirmations to accept if that other thing is already there

1331
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,470
to consider these

1332
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,780
networks an extreme situation but  cheating

1333
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,460
on the bitcoin network harms a great deal of

1334
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,530
harm to the happiness of the network because it

1335
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,060
means if it is possible to cheat

1336
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,440
people it means that  drop a

1337
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,720
lot of real on the network and then the

1338
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,700
price could drop you are always

1339
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,740
at the b col it's worth 100 euros it was a

1340
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,870
return of five six blocks

1341
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:37,640
as an executive you can no longer trust

1342
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,770
bitcoin and therefore while trying to

1343
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:41,330
sell their currency because  it has

1344
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,580
nothing to do with this scam here

1345
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,890
this thing means that a miner is

1346
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,120
able to make a scam of this

1347
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,920
kind is going to brugg ag with his

1348
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,840
interest because he is he has invested a

1349
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,220
lot to carry out his

1350
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,660
mailing center, do it later  the

1351
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,170
father

1352
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:55,460
I don't know if he gets to see you make some

1353
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,410
videos against several million to

1354
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:58,580
have a manning plant set up

1355
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,830
so you can scam

1356
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:03,110
some kind of scam but it

1357
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,030
completely damages bitcoin remained his

1358
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,380
business plan in the long term he

1359
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,810
[ __ ] up and then  there is another reason for

1360
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,730
not being able to do it that is there must be there

1361
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,320
are all these felt considerable

1362
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,820
all together make the miners

1363
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,580
difficult  you go mine to cheat but it is

1364
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,680
better never to trust and therefore I repeat

1365
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,090
the rule with the above and consider

1366
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,140
how much we are because it requires the

1367
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,210
transfer and if to find hicks

1368
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,390
blocks it costs less it

1369
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:28,160
may be that then the scam is

1370
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:36,080
worth doing the others

1371
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,440
other miners terrible miners are

1372
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,080
outdone because this miner with

1373
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,670
computational power if he has more lyric computational power

1374
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:47,180
always comes before them if

1375
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,220
he generally says he must have 51

1376
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,440
percent computation protests just

1377
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,730
be lucky he might have

1378
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,500
40 percent could already do a certain amount of

1379
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,530
following could try but it always goes

1380
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:01,070
against their long-term interest it is

1381
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:03,110
difficult but we always hope probability

1382
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,010
there is another thing they said

1383
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,900
at the beginning and there is in the small saying

1384
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,610
that yes  speaks of probability not certainty

1385
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,410
because if you were instead

1386
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,120
certain that as soon as one has

1387
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,980
more computing power than another, it

1388
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,140
always means that as soon as one is more

1389
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,990
in addition to the other it would always win

1390
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:19,910
all subsequent blocks and then the network would

1391
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,200
enter immediately centralized it

1392
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,930
would become a normal paypal instead 16

1393
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:25,760
a probability even if one goes to

1394
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,750
one percent

1395
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,030
it is not said that it will succeed in simple it is

1396
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:31,190
probable it is very safe but it is  always a

1397
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,080
probability so we say this is a

1398
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,200
greater certainty and in any case

1399
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,440
it is always a question that is a

1400
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,040
bit exile from bitcoin but it concerns let's say the

1401
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,630
cor the body ok blog chain for which we

1402
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,410
also talk about block chain out of

1403
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:56,540
decrypted care yes o  on other areas

1404
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,750
something is moving there is talk of

1405
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,920
a hypothetical public there is talk of

1406
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,200
sergi who can benefit from this

1407
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,140
then there is blue china it has become a

1408
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,640
ward base and is used to

1409
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,950
request investments in general there is

1410
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,360
most of it  so west kitchen of the

1411
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,360
exceptions but brooks eni means

1412
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,480
that decentralized distributed network

1413
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,580
that is sure and that allows

1414
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,740
everyone to enter and participate in the

1415
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,720
student in a very simple way instead to

1416
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,460
whom they say the brooks chain at the end is

1417
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,730
a database distributed among

1418
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:35,870
selected people in fact it is said that it is a as

1419
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:38,150
one said for mission remission to

1420
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,190
read others in other words to say

1421
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,080
to say that a but that has come  a

1422
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,180
database educated among a few where

1423
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,160
only they can enter when you say that it

1424
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,180
would be good for the public

1425
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,150
administration can make sense and in

1426
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,820
general you can also do other

1427
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,440
things that say to transfer the value

1428
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,060
let's say it is what you plan to do

1429
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,290
in the public administration  to

1430
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,240
save ash within the

1431
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,070
bitcoin network for example a touch of

1432
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:02,810
documents that indicate that there are

1433
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,550
procedures that have been

1434
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:07,640


1435
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,900


1436
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,020


1437
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,510
correct

1438
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:15,830
are not changed over time that there

1439
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:16,880
is someone who goes from hidden to

1440
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,130
change something they had taken

1441
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,320
photograph these comments or put

1442
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,020
a sheet of text calculate lush and then

1443
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,540
leave it to put it as a comment of the

1444
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,060
transaction this thing means that it

1445
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,730
looks like it is also born

1446
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,730
to protect intellectual property

1447
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,200
for example I made a

1448
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,780
music a song an mp3  I calculate you leave

1449
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,120
these three but to make a transaction of a

1450
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,640
few cents and I put my ex as a comment

1451
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,050


1452
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:46,460
this means that to cancel after

1453
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,770
we have passed that I know 67 thousand

1454
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:51,140
blocks on Saturdays blocks in the middle of a

1455
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,900
huge cost that you can not return

1456
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,800
back

1457
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,230
means that it can be shown that in

1458
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:58,730
that moment there that could have been a

1459
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,720
year ago there was that of that song ii

1460
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,800
time and having done them too much

1461
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,850
I leave a song then I did a

1462
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,380
launch of a zip file where it is written

1463
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,600
I wrote this song with

1464
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,710
the song in there too

1465
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:11,180
so someone comes along who comes out

1466
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,410
good and says no to this but I didn't do it

1467
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:15,500
I wanted to show zip look at this

1468
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,750
guy and yes  it was there that day and contained

1469
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,460
these files here including only me

1470
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,440
signing 12 kg I record all the proofs you

1471
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,100
want

1472
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,780
in this way to want to prove in

1473
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,110
a certain mathematical way and absolutely

1474
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:29,420
that you cannot reverse the ownership of

1475
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,280
that object there and then  you can also do

1476
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,210
everything for the public administration,

1477
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,890
that is, all the documents that you have to

1478
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:35,120
prove that I know that they have not been

1479
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,130
modified you take a photograph you go

1480
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,290
light you also use the market allows

1481
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:40,430
mind not of one all of them an

1482
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,470
infinity of documents and go to  save

1483
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:43,670
