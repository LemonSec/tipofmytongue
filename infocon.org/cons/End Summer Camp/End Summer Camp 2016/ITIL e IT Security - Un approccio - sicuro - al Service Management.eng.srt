1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,180
it is a talk with a typically technical cut

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,700
I simply want to let people know

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,550
what it is the it infrastructure

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,740
library which is a set of best

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,660
practices that we skip this one dates back

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,630
to the end of the 80s there are a few

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,390
publications there were about thirty now there

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,689
are five core publications plus  other

9
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,058
complementaries that are not available for

10
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:37,860
free, unfortunately, this is what

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,570
service management talks about and

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,510
therefore comes a little closer if we

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,480
talk about the former ISO 20000 is not

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,700
known by everyone even though it is a

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,160
framework that is still very well known in

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,140
the business environment and when  it is also talked about

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,809
in the security field everyone

18
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,239
tells me is however it is service management and

19
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,650
maybe it has nothing to do with security

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,239


21
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,330
here it is not strictly true the meetings

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,330
there are many references to elements of

23
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,320
security both applied and how to say at

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,590
a higher level  management as

25
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,470
risk management and therefore with this

26
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,820
presentation I wanted to give a brief

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,850
overview of some of the controls

28
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,460
which are present therefore

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,470
suggest an integrated approach

30
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,329
when doing service management and

31
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,420
also think about security or even how to

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,390
say when there is a budget to be for

33
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,970
service management you can also do

34
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,579
security since as we know

35
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,950
especially in the Italian panorama it is  a

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,170
little difficult to be able to get money

37
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,480


38
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,640
in security areas unless there

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,510
are glaring problems it is so two

40
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,900
words but first about what is not itil

41
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,520
then it is not a standard so

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,670
generally this is also felt in

43
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,410
those who are insiders  which calls it

44
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,509
standard but in reality as you

45
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,240
all know very well to give an example the

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,810
iso 27001 is a standard because it is

47
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,810
something on which you can perform a hearing

48
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,210
and therefore say they are complaints are not

49
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,190
compliant even with respect to certain

50
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,810
parts not completely the respect to

51
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,600
all  the iso itil is something that

52
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,370
I can decide to adopt or not

53
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,620
are the best practices are

54
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,250
suggestions more than anything else an  that many

55
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,680
things are common sense but

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,390
someone had the idea of putting them down to

57
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,280
write them to be remembered and to

58
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,130
make them useful also to someone else

59
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,620
so I said it is not a standard if

60
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,810
you hear of the products that are sold as

61
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,610
the compliant which in reality is not

62
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,110
absolutely true because this depends on the

63
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,140
implementation and how

64
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,410
the project is organized so it does not

65
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,120
depend on the product as it does not

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,730
specify clearly all the vendors will

67
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,930
tell you that they are itil compliant

68
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,680
chrome

69
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,100
then as I said before here it is

70
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,690
generally believed that there are no

71
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,670
references to safety and  are two

72
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,340
completely separate things while instead

73
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,510
the correct approach would be to

74
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,050
integrate seris management with

75
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,580
security let's see briefly why

76
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,250
there are a lot of them you will see slides

77
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,930
full of text but those

78
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,840
you can possibly read even after I do

79
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,910
an overview a little quick because  there is

80
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,530
an example a notable case in

81
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,110
quotes which

82
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:49,010
I discuss next  so when a little

83
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,440
quick then here you see 4 of the 5

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,710
corradi itil publications where I

85
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,370
reported some of the processes described

86
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,090
in these publications because they are the

87
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,090
ones that touch on issues

88
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,730
closest to liti security, for example, there is no

89
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,170
publication of the surrey

90
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,330
strategy because  we don't give a damn

91
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,930
for the momentum here is co we see for the

92
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,548
publication of service design then

93
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:22,060
design and some of the processes

94
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,300
included which are some of the controls

95
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,100
and security for example for the

96
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,640
availability of services capacity then

97
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,650
adaptation information security

98
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,850
management

99
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,530
let's go back to the speech of the first c  '' it is a

100
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,630
process specifically called

101
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,300
information security

102
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,180
management supplier management therefore make sure that they

103
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,610
are in line with our

104
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,280
security policies continuity of service

105
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,620
because that is different from the ability

106
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,090
obviously almost speaks continuity to the

107
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,380
service in progress

108
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,740
therefore high availability service

109
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,660
transitional change  management  these

110
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,220
are things that you may have already

111
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,500
heard under others under other names

112
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,410
change management so

113
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,300
everything related to approval flows

114
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,460
know what happens in the company

115
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,440
because if a change occurs but has

116
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,360
not been authorized then you no longer

117
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,590
know what happens  go

118
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,700
back back out plans business

119
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,470
continuity plans up to disaster

120
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,250
recovery

121
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,710
all this in the organizational phase but

122
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,710
then there are also example cases for

123
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,470
the implementation

124
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,750


125
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,640


126
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,990
enough in

127
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,100
detail in suggesting approaches on how to

128
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,550
physically implement

129
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,320
what we are talking about very

130
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,770
briefly at this moment the

131
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,389
whole process of knowledge management does not hold up

132
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,789


133
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:56,319
I have included only one point of

134
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,849
security awareness courses which in reality would be

135
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:00,220
one of the most important things is halfway

136
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,629
but it would be one of the most important things

137
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,300
because it never does  a [ __ ] about anyone

138
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,909
in this world while instead it would

139
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,979
also cost relatively little simply to

140
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,310
educate even just your users

141
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,930
jarvis asset configuration obviously

142
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,819
know what we have

143
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:18,789
and how to manage it here is the service for

144
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:20,979
and fan service operation and perhaps the

145
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:24,970
most known publication in

146
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,180
practical terms because  in fact it is the one that comes

147
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,530
closest to doing things

148
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,819
event management so we talk

149
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,340
more about if we want to associate it

150
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,090
with products products cm sponsors planck

151
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,690
arcsight know everyone so I suppose

152
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,400
going to identify which are the

153
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,389
events that may interest us on the

154
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,169
systems on the  network on mobile know

155
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,240
how to manage them with event reports

156
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,120
so here is where I wrote siem

157
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,380
incident management which is what

158
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,509
we are going to see next because there is an

159
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:04,150
interesting case of difference between

160
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,870
teams and misters which is a bit more of an

161
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:14,069
approach of  security management of the

162
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:18,610
so-called problems that would be the

163
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,259
root cause of  incidents for pilots and

164
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,819
access management clearly

165
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,669
because we know that when we leave

166
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:29,650
a company or when

167
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,880
any employee leaves a

168
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,069
company obviously his account

169
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:36,360
will remain open

170
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,570
continue to be put in probably

171
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,540
this is a  a publication that is a

172
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,940
bit real arching among the

173
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,200
core publications of till because in reality these

174
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,620
activities are applied or should

175
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,960
be applied to everything else

176
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,710
so they are not related to the

177
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,090
publication continues to always serve

178
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,100
moment any service can probably be

179
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,500
translated on all publications  that

180
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,300
we have seen previously and also on

181
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,730
strategic locations we have not we have not

182
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,050
seen

183
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,680
here is a square and I was saying is that even the

184
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,440
most famous is the management of accidents

185
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,330
then what is it that you call this

186
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,550
probably if you have also come to

187
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,890
akimbo you will have noticed some references

188
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,280
with the  presentation by davide

189
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,690
delvecchio who spoke about incident

190
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,360
response

191
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,830
there are two definitions  ni that I wanted to

192
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,530
include to show the

193
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,679
different and more generalist cut,

194
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,950
let's say with an accident definition

195
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,890
which is an unplanned interruption

196
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,770
of the provision of a service in a

197
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,180
lowering of the quality of delivery

198
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,540
of a service therefore not low to say

199
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,600
an accident  security while on the other hand

200
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,490
nist in 861 risk violation

201
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,320
while violation of best

202
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,540
practice policies is a different cut

203
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,140
clearly however it is because we have two

204
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,310
different focuses you think about the service the

205
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,920
nist and goes to think about a part of

206
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,980
services that is different

207
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,589
in fact I have reported  generally those

208
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:21,920
that are the macro steps under which

209
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,740
it will obviously be necessary to go to

210
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,360
detail the activities of itil

211
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,089
and of the nist here as you can see if I

212
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:37,089
am going to manage an

213
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:40,720
IT incident management procedure relying

214
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,620
only on one of the two frameworks I leave

215
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,290
some aside  what

216
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,839
so actually the correct approach

217
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,180
would always be to think a little

218
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,579
more  in a big way that is when I go to the

219
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,290
implementation to think about the

220
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,970
implementation then already in the

221
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,350
design phase say let's go and see what

222
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,480
one thing says the other let's try to

223
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,880
put them together to do

224
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,120
something integrated and therefore more

225
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,240
effective for the answer  of accidents

226
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,940
because it is not

227
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,610
certain that the German in the pedes is a soc and a bar service

228
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,890
that does not have to be aware of

229
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,649
basic notions of safety in reality the

230
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:34,529
sharing of knowledge is precisely

231
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:38,769
what to choose,

232
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:41,370
it would be better to evaluate an

233
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,240
integrated approach because there  I can

234
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,000
guarantee from experience that it works

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,190
better

236
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,320
here then I wanted to collect

237
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,459
some basic recommendations that is

238
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,500
bell awareness certainly we have

239
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,000
already discussed it before that I do not need

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,300
anything to have dozens of policies

241
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,980
procedures and all documentation the

242
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,350
usual one that is called

243
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,390
crap but in reality  it is done well it serves

244
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,579
the problem is that then people do not

245
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:18,040
apply it then  on that there must

246
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,620
certainly be a focus on testing my

247
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,459
recovery plans

248
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:23,260
actually if a disaster

249
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,209
recovery plan that then doesn't work

250
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:27,360
for me in reality then I have to close the company

251
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,800
this is not nice it has happened a couple of

252
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,850
cases

253
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,920
oh well paradigm they put us

254
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,449
simply because  it fit very well

255
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:38,680
because when I think of the cia paradigm in

256
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,310
general I can apply it to

257
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,860
whatever comes to mind and I already change

258
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,730
my point of view on that thing

259
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,880
communication also put the two arrows

260
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,600
horizontal vertical horizontal

261
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,959
clearly communicate between colleagues and

262
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,790
vertical for the scale  hierarchical for the

263
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,949
hierarchical ladder sorry that there must always

264
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:08,800
be someone who can decide

265
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,310
who knows what happened

266
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,829
so back to the king decision the

267
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:16,360
tracking this is quite

268
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,730
important but it is always underestimated

269
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,009
because there is always a lack of

270
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,899
information of the information recording

271
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,209
in companies for which

272
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:27,970
something happens but in reality I lose it  na

273
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,910
who should know does not know because

274
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,920
when it happened whoever detected the

275
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,079
thing did not

276
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:38,170
register enough information there are

277
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,170
tools that cost an avalanche of

278
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,579
money in the world I am talking more

279
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,189
about ticketing systems

280
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:51,279
in reality more extensive are the disabled

281
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,430
management where companies prefer to

282
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,589
spend a lot of money maybe for a

283
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:58,180
product that costs 100 thousand euros for a

284
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,490
license and then overlook the training

285
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:08,050
or the air force of the insertion

286
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,810
of some information by those who

287
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,380
should do it here is not very wise

288
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,380
as a choice maybe  I could not

289
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,459
consider products that cost a little

290
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:24,250
less and then go to fully use them

291
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,970
in the company

292
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,139
to avoid problems later as I

293
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,759
said I left it for last but in reality it is

294
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,600
among the most important the integration that

295
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,610
just as we have seen before if

296
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,170
we try to have a slightly

297
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,509
more holistic approach between the frameworks that

298
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:44,759
exist so don't just think about

299
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,800
service management e  do not think

300
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,069
only about security,

301
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:52,970
we will probably be able to have a better result,

302
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,040
certainly what kind of

303
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,129
leaving you with this talk is the fact of

304
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:04,019
saying if you hear about service

305
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,089
management and in the company or about these things

306
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:10,050
in general and you do security do not

307
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,399
despair because c  'it is a way to maybe

308
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,189
divert some funds also on

309
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,009
security because service management and

310
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:21,720
if we talk about services but people talk

311
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,939
about till good or bad it is the most

312
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:26,519
recognized framework in the world as you have seen and

313
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,139
there are elements that recall

314
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:31,500
to safety so depending on the

315
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,569
purpose of the project

316
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:36,290
remember that it may be useful to

317
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,660
suggest an integrated approach for

318
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,199
kate yellow does the pil already recalls

319
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,860
all the things I talked about now

320
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,850
if you have any questions I am not even kept by

321
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,360
plans
