1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
so hello everyone

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,819
then it will not be a

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,700
discursive enough talk it will have some technical parts

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,080
hopes if you want to intervene so much for the better

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,480
so it becomes a little

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,120
less monotonous for everyone what

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,890
we do we make a history of

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,490
how the

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,800
technology of digital equipment has progressed quickly in the

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,109
sense  of cell phones and similar smartphones

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,050
and how they have progressed at the

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,810
same time also the technology

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,120
of the devices that are used to go and

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,649
check the information that is

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,140
inside for any reason

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,469
usually for investigative purposes

17
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:41,870
and therefore

18
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,000
as I said and probably there are

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,160
few fields  where technology has

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,039
progressed so much since 1973 it seems to me

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,199
where the use of the first mobile phone has been the most

22
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:53,969


23
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,699
we have gone from analog to digital mobile phones

24
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,280


25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,100
then we have moved on to the

26
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,960
device they are programmable

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,339
then the iphone has arrived  which changed

28
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,220
the cards a bit, then

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,590
all the new i systems arrived  or I

30
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,880
ended up with a photo that

31
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,140
this one not because it is particularly

32
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,470
wanted but because it is interesting because

33
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,880
it is apparently doing to show

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,640
what they think rightly or wrongly

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,520
is the new frontier of

36
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,380
personal computing, that is a

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,380
device that hp for  their product

38
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,420
we will talk about later they call 3 in 1 ie

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,630
mobile laptop desktop all tucked

40
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,270
into one in one chorus is

41
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,100
clearly the quality of information

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,720
available between an old start to

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,799
a 9 50 is dramatically different

44
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,020
then first analysis ie when has it ever

45
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,250
happened  the first time having to

46
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,409
analyze a gsm phone luckily

47
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,320
already the legacy that the quality

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,250
of information that could be found

49
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,940
very little will be finished because because the sms and the

50
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,010
address book were on the sim so

51
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,690
the only thing that was needed was to have a

52
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,790
reader of  smart card insert in the

53
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,410
dinner and pre-race smart card reader to

54
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,508
have the full because if not there was no

55
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:12,190
saints all said to be in

56
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,690
able to violate a pin but

57
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,420
basically no one has ever succeeded and to

58
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,700
withdraw out a few bytes had the

59
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,230
advantage that since there was no real file

60
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,580
system but

61
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,600
memory cells that were more or less

62
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,820
deleted, it could also find

63
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,730
several sms or address book entries

64
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,920
deleted inside the sim the

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,040
phones had very little memory

66
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,260
display limited to the maximum what

67
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,540
was inside the phone was the

68
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,030
call list and how did you

69
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,650
go to get the

70
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,750
call list you basically had to

71
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,370
get something that was impossible

72
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,709
to find and it cost a lot of money

73
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,010
which was a data cable for a gsm it was a

74
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,570
thing that on the one hand I buy the

75
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,640
proprietary connector on the other hand it had

76
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,130
a rs 232 open a terminal and

77
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,500
discover that the old ati commands that

78
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,600
we old and old used to use  when

79
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,330
we connect with the vps there were such and

80
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,540
such in the modem of the gsm and not only

81
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,250
could you connect to make a

82
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,500
data connection of a slowness es  another aspiring

83
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,590
but with a special addendum to the commands to

84
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,570
standard yes there was the possibility to

85
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,010
query a series of registers that

86
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,350
were not standard but that contained the

87
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,850
call list and rather

88
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,769
other things so basically all

89
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:26,380
the analysis was done with a terminal

90
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,489
at 9,600 baud a serial cable an

91
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:32,739
eternal series of commands ati many owners

92
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,019
that you had to go to get from god only

93
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:37,410
knows where

94
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,930
this are some examples

95
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,670
old nokia connector

96
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,310
this was a Motorola phone with a

97
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,780
kind of jack that contained

98
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,569
a serial and tc inside  put on the headphones it

99
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,940
never worked and that lounge is a very

100
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,190
classic smart card reader with

101
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,810
which you can read a sim because in the

102
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,970
end a sim is always a smart

103
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,300
card and so on the quite

104
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,860
significant step that we

105
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,170
had we had with when the  cell

106
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,150
phones started to have color displays

107
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,700
and cameras I remember I

108
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,310
had an old Sony Ericsson where I

109
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,080
once  I have been to switzerland and

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,760
managed to find the camera that

111
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,589
cost the wrath of god knows very little

112
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,540
take the camera and hook it

113
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,029
into the connector below you took photos and

114
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,590
videos and photos that were probably

115
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,050
three pixels by four with  five colors,

116
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,580
however, it seemed to you that it was cool

117
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,820
unbelievable what happens

118
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,070
the interfaces at the pin level have changed these

119
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,070
phones you exposed something that

120
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,960
allowed you to bring the photos to the computer you

121
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,630
always needed a data cable that

122
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,850
usually cost a god to join that not

123
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,800
you could find it in any shop that was

124
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,169
available but you had the possibility to

125
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:48,669
do this thing

126
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:49,680
some

127
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,090
particularly children models also had the

128
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,190
possibility of having inside the famous

129
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,710
memory cards

130
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,930
the emmc that were in that

131
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,930
period mmc and various or the dreams that it has

132
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,470
always had  its its its its memory

133
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,780
stick diffused only among its

134
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,850
products etcetera in this case it brings

135
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,320
out information it was relatively

136
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,100
if  simple because since the world started

137
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,750
the only one makes the universal system widespread

138
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,090
on any system in beta of this

139
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,580
world remains made it and then it was enough to

140
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,160
take the memory card put it in a

141
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,440
reader you saw all the various artifacts of

142
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,690
all various things clearly were

143
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,979
different things that is even in these

144
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,390
evolved mobile phones the

145
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,640
lavender call list still manages to

146
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,130
take via serial or usb connection

147
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,940
for the more advanced models and so on

148
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,590
so let's say this was more or less

149
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,139
the second phase even when it had

150
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:46,210
no tools  there were no things

151
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,340
but we began to see that the

152
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,590
mobile terminal could contain a whole series

153
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,479
of interesting things

154
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,210
to us several cases have happened we are

155
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,060
talking in the mid-2000s more or

156
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,050
less

157
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,190
and there we discovered an

158
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,810
interesting thing that since cell phones

159
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,759
are equipped with cameras people

160
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,150
use them for particularly spicy purposes

161
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,380
from here it is understood once in this

162
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,729
fact a raid by the

163
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,440
carabinieri we found ourselves a

164
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,150
lot of computers and cell phones

165
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,580
we saw three people arrive saying

166
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,949
please please do not bring out the

167
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:20,110
forces that are inside because

168
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,569
god knows what appeared I remember

169
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:25,000
we were talking about the first analysis tools

170
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,400
etcetera etcetera he had managed to

171
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,990
get his hands on a small

172
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,389
clear tool a software that sucked

173
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:34,630
then in sucks still now and I

174
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,910
said to the audience come on someone gives me the

175
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,500
mobile phone to analyze them and everyone

176
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,449
made an unequivocal gesture that is

177
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:41,280
use yours

178
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,900
this  it makes us understand why digital photography

179
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
has had all this success

180
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,159
compared to photography with

181
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,470
film

182
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,409
well we pass 29 eras then what

183
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,569
happened at a certain point I have always

184
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,280
been a handle of agents in the pd to

185
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,440
[ __ ] things like that

186
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,880
I have always found that they were very useful

187
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,810
then I never managed to

188
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,400
organize my life through

189
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,759
these so for now it's cool to have them

190
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,320
I am particularly  old I see that

191
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,090
in the bat ha instead it is not like that if not

192
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,710
for some person

193
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,409
someone of you remembers an

194
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:17,620
English company that was called cion cion was born

195
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,150
as a video game company for the

196
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,020
spectrum that cool to all even

197
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,300
revox the old dempsey did not make little

198
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,740
objects that  in my opinion they were

199
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,479
hallucinating losers even just for the

200
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,810
mechanical system there was lops aion 5 mx

201
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,849
who remembers that when you opened it

202
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:35,710
you had the keyboard sliding

203
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,870
forward there were fantastic web toys

204
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,229
cion besides making video games now

205
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:42,370
did  in addition to doing these

206
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,889
fantastic things especially to the operating system

207
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:46,030
with an office automation suite

208
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,520
we are also talking here really a

209
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,449
long time ago that was at the

210
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:53,740
forefront because it used

211
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,599
multitasking plenty because it was very

212
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,400
simple to use it

213
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,690
was

214
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,510
also the protagonist of a psy on system  of

215
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,820
a famous gabrini case do you remember the

216
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,810
famous palmtop of lioce

217
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,120
that had files encrypted in pgp and

218
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,440
was sent to the s  united to

219
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,910
break it obviously returned

220
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,770
exactly as they were before the files

221
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,750
because not even the

222
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,150
yankees can do

223
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,680
anything to math what happens because it pulls this

224
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,630
thing out because this operating system and

225
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,790
has particularly smart for which a

226
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,669
series of companies including

227
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,729
cion that you sell the thing but sony  nokia

228
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:34,190
sony ericsson doc or motorola texas

229
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,400
instruments and a lot of others took

230
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,370
made a consortium bought dub cion

231
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,830
the sources of the operating system and

232
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,250
renamed it with the name of symbian

233
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,200
so since then we had in my pocket it

234
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,880
seems like a very cool thing the first

235
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,589
mobile phone on which  being able to install

236
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:53,960
applications against you you know that

237
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,120
at the time there was another very cool house

238
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,870
that was the palm who remembers

239
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,450
the alphabet made by the palm that is it had

240
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,070
become fashionable to exchange the

241
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,140
business card via irda using

242
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,170
using the pal fa  very cool at

243
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,880
conventions to do something like that

244
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,660
palma at one point said what

245
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,240
happens if we catch  or

246
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,040
a gsm component we put it

247
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,010
inside a pan and instead of the

248
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,260
writing recognition let's put it

249
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,770
keyboard what was born was

250
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,390
a very interesting smartphone

251
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,240
called palm treo

252
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,080
these two are two

253
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,700
particularly interesting systems because they

254
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,200
were the first really the first

255
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,060
smartphones were very limited because

256
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,070
obviously the speed was not that of

257
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,290
now but being able to install

258
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,910
applications

259
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,920
obviously there were no stores there

260
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,870
was no vii store in the pan they weren't

261
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,959
wrong you had to go bought the file 8

262
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,000
downloaded from the internet or insert the

263
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,550
memory card to copy it  about the thing but

264
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,620
these things were extensible so

265
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,100
you had a lot of

266
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,480
control applications at that time

267
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,730
the first analysis software began to come out that

268
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,070
beautifully fought the fact that

269
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,079
these things could be in all

270
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:10,089
respects of

271
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:12,160
computers even if very limited

272
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,749
so what  it happened to attach a

273
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:16,269
symbian palm to him the analis software  i

274
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:18,399
brought out the most trivial things

275
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,059
calls sms and things to other but all the

276
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:24,100
applications beautifully lady goes to the

277
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,839
maximum serves to your lucky you

278
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,499
took out the photographs and there were

279
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:30,759
still some feature phones that

280
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,529
basically used java as the

281
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:34,600
environment on which they will be in  to be able to

282
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,249
install some application on china if

283
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:38,680
god wanted it and if there was enough memory

284
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,649


285
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:43,209
so here we have a bit of an overview

286
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,100
I the panels had all I liked

287
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,050
to die for then obviously they failed

288
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,069
because I have always had a great taste in

289
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:50,079
flash technology

290
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,959
I loved  s2 and he died and immediately

291
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,839
bought a next one and died and then with

292
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,790
good palms and they are dead he takes

293
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,399
bad luck and there is nothing else to say

294
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,470
other thing that did at that moment thun

295
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,959
a bang that no longer came and that then  it is

296
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,600
dead I also had that one in fact when you

297
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,899
think about it it was blackberry

298
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,610
the american will be a very tired terminal

299
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,589
with which you could read the emails was

300
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:16,660
born as you know that the

301
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,389
Americans had  compared to us

302
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:22,420
Europeans they had [ __ ] networks and

303
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,829
for which they tried to communicate in

304
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,899
a different way we had sms they

305
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,089
were centuries behind and therefore they had the

306
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:30,429
pages blackberry was born as

307
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:32,290
an evolution of the pager with which you

308
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,040
receive via email something very fabulous then

309
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,569
has evolved into a thing that already this is

310
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:39,850
an advanced model with which

311
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,439
basically what was going on in your

312
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,499
company you had an encore thing in the

313
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:46,179
company that took all the e-mails

314
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,790
that came to you and shot

315
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,740
directly in an encrypted way

316
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,740
unless you  it was a differently

317
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,730
democratic country in that case of lawlessness

318
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,860
the keys also went to the pipe government

319
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,509
I receive encrypted all your

320
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,110
emails well the interesting thing is that

321
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,730
blackberry has made discover the use

322
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,860
of mobile technology to all the

323
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,050
substantially industrial pirates that

324
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,589
there  were obviously more leagues came out

325
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:13,899
through blackberries than

326
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,819
through all previous

327
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,339
systems to get information out of

328
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:21,639
a company well change the

329
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:24,730
analysis systems at that time two very interesting things come out

330
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,170
the first is called

331
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,660
paraben of vice season of an

332
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,759
american company is called point paraben the

333
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,220
second is called ufed of salt bright

334
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,649
an

335
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:37,689
Israeli company screens fi yes i was the

336
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:39,699
first software that somehow

337
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:41,439
gave you that process that meant

338
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:42,910
attacking the serial writing a lot

339
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,429
of commands by hand the interesting thing is

340
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:47,139
that it is an american product you know

341
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,850
that for the americans the world begins

342
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,179
in san francisco and ends in new york

343
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,500
whatever  other thing simply does not exist

344
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,750
inc sunt leones so

345
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,209
what happens that para well did was

346
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:59,649
fine on those strange things

347
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:01,899
like the american verizon network that anything

348
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:03,579
but a gsm all the models that

349
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:06,309
worked there but if you went a

350
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:08,740
nokia it went into crisis because it was a

351
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,199
totally non-existent terminal or

352
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:12,699
February instead was a

353
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,799
revolutionary thing because it was revolutionary

354
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,720
because the problem c  As I told you

355
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,370
until then it was that when you get a

356
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,519
thing in your hand you had to

357
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,899
first try to get data out

358
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,339
as quickly as possible before they

359
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:26,589
downloaded they lost everything but then

360
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,179
finding the cable and finding the cable

361
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:30,670
was a problem so this

362
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,110
Israeli company are  succeeded with a nice

363
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,939
bag

364
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:36,399
a frightening purchase price and a

365
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,920
piece of keeping still scary

366
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,110
but inside the bag more you would find a

367
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,809
lot of coves every time

368
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:45,670
a new model came out if you paid the lover

369
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,019
you got the courier at home and you

370
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,490
said top this is the pitch of the

371
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,949
day for the yz cellphone that as soon as

372
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:54,009
this thing came out it was basically

373
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:56,290
a boon for anyone who did this

374
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,990
type of analysis the analysis was a

375
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,959
purely logical analysis what

376
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,420


377
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,220


378
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,839
the device that is well illustrated here basically means

379
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,850
in its first version it had two

380
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,879
usb ports in one you connected the cable that

381
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,740
attached the mobile phone in another to you

382
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,929
connected a pen  drive he took

383
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:20,319
worked the time he worked at a

384
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,199
certain point tv to find an html file

385
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,230
on a pendrive the html file was the

386
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,299
result of the extraction that

387
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,370
this device did of the information

388
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,339
available inside the mobile phone

389
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,690
the water sibility by the  operator

390
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,790
to vary these parameters or the

391
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,110
behavior was

392
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,420
practically zero for a long time so there you have to

393
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,410
trust what you basically

394
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,440
received but let's say that compared to

395
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,950
all the others it was a remarkable leap

396
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,950


397
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,570
these you do not see some things the

398
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,000
famous cables I received packages  of

399
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,430
stuff and I must say that it was really

400
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,680
the first time that the analysis of a

401
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,630
mobile device has become

402
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,020
a little user friendly in history

403
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,709
we pass almost today we have the market

404
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,779
that is divided between

405
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:12,339
different operating systems we have basically

406
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:15,220
three we pretend we have three  because

407
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,190
nokia you know that it dies in the sense that

408
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,320
when it came out you bring out the

409
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,420
forty-eighth model of the ste  sso

410
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,339
cellphone that simply to the colors

411
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:26,290
of the different keyboard probably

412
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,410
is not innovating so but nokia as a

413
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,649
communications giant dies and various other

414
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,540
companies are there that pull the latest

415
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,240
sony ericsson blackberry after a couple of

416
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,380
scary slips that too dies

417
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,390
and the good day comes out  good old

418
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,959
steve with the iphone the iphone you know that it

419
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,329
has totally changed as far as

420
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:51,399
we can be or not to be

421
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,959
apple externator has totally changed

422
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,930
our way of seeing telephony is

423
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,520
eliminated the keyboard is put the

424
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,970
capacitive touch very intuitive but

425
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,070
we have for the  first time in the world a

426
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,110
phone that always

427
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,730
on notice very well Americans

428
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,890
who come on holiday to Europe go

429
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,690
back and get stratospheric bills

430
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,089
because obviously the

431
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:14,980
phone the phone did not know

432
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,560
how much traffic in roaming when they were

433
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,680
in Europe but the idea  it is good we have

434
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,410
two good ideas that have changed everything

435
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,120
the first is the fact of av  to be an

436
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,950
always on phone the second to have an app

437
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,500
store that is you no longer had to turn three

438
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,149
quarters of the internet to find the

439
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:33,220
navigator for your phone you went to the

440
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,410
app store paid by credit

441
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,810
card and who came directly in

442
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,200
pushing the application  google with

443
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,740
android

444
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,720
found the goose that lays golden eggs you

445
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,300
know that google bought the company

446
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,730
that made android 75 million euros

447
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,820
and it seems that up to now on the revenue it

448
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,700
has received in terms of

449
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,050
android advertising for google it has passed the

450
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,500
billion  15 dollars a year that even

451
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,240
if he had bought drugs he would have made such

452
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,059
a good investment

453
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:07,099
microsoft microsoft had a few ideas

454
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:10,579
but very confused he came out with windows which

455
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,199
was cool but not too much so no

456
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,780
let's throw it away then he came out with a few pc which

457
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,099
was interesting but he had the  same

458
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,500
desktop interface so no let's throw it away

459
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,890
then released with

460
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,609
other 45 rebuts each time it had to be

461
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,069
the definitive system and each time it

462
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,660
lasted a year and a half  two then it was

463
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,680
thrown

464
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,140
let's say that on the marketing part if

465
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,090
they had trained monkeys

466
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,990
they would probably get

467
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,020
better results it all in the meantime they have

468
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,750
evolved then oxygen is that is a file has

469
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,240
become touch a thing consume in

470
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,060
dossier that awards and does a whole series

471
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,250
of analyzes  but it starts to do something

472
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,610
interesting it supports apps

473
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,920
so we already have the possibility of

474
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,600
not only extracting basic data

475
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,090
regarding phone calls, phone books, things

476
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,040
like that but we also begin to have

477
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,500
support for apps because because you

478
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,870
know that services that were

479
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,360
absolutely fundamental before  and that even

480
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,350
now our kind telco providers

481
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,590
give us parcels such as sms that

482
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,940
are now limited that no one uses anymore

483
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,030
are gradually replaced by

484
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,320
applications that can be

485
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,590
messenger online weil rather than

486
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,490
whatsapp and similar

487
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,960
to this we add an

488
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,210
interesting solution  that comes on the market that

489
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,050
is oxygen forensics suite is a partner  age

490
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,720
there is this haqqani mare I do not remember

491
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,700
however of eastern europe that creates this

492
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,040
software the only software solution

493
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,100
that there is in the world very interesting and

494
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,080
then comes a very nice product

495
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,090
called xray xact that comes from northern

496
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,270
europe  one flaw if you do not pay

497
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,220
the lover lance stops working

498
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,390
that is, it is not that they do not send you the cables

499
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,010
you simply have a very expensive

500
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,310
doorstop on your desk

501
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,320
but it is a little known product to us

502
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,120
in southern Europe in the United States but it is

503
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,700
extremely under  useful and used

504
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,010
travesto we can say that i xact

505
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,990
which pronounced right would be extract is

506
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,640
the first software that supports the

507
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,750
physical analysis of the phone because

508
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,880
because before the phones saved everything

509
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,340
on files from the iphone onwards they

510
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,230
began to say it is interesting the

511
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,060
possibility of using  of the databases

512
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,370
then you know very well that on everything in

513
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,650
any modern smartphone all the

514
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,559
information is provided through

515
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,330
databases that you tend  at least they are

516
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,000
sequel light what is the advantage of the

517
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,420
database compared to the file has the

518
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,800
advantage that the information is not

519
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,210
deleted immediately the gear

520
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,210
remains there marked as deleted

521
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,559
so you are convinced that you have

522
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,720
deleted that compromising message

523
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,340
with the girl you met there  'other

524
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,320
evening but reality is there parked

525
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,540
inside the database and then

526
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,940
going to do an analysis of the tables

527
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,830
contained in the sequel light file you

528
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,260
find yourself at that and many other things that

529
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,140
you were convinced you had deleted

530
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,110
not only but the physical analysis  it also allows you

531
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,059
to estrada and those artifacts have

532
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:15,429
been deleted you took the photo in

533
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:17,440
disabled and the girl from the other night

534
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,059
we sent the message

535
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:21,309
you deleted the photo the photo is

536
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:23,980
still on the memory the memory to a

537
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,260
file system that has a fat if I  I do

538
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,240
a physical extraction or the possibility

539
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,550
to go and parse all the

540
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,100
memory blocks and re-extract that

541
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,920
photo that could  be terribly

542
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,440
compromising and useful for an investigation

543
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,300
so extrac itself was the first tool

544
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,820
to endure this thing gradually then

545
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,500
over time

546
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,880
others of yours have been added who do the same thing

547
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,850
now oxygen forensics fit does the same

548
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,580
thing off and has a  part which is called

549
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,679
ufed physical analyzer which does precisely

550
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,230
this

551
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,420
takes through various techniques instead of

552
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,559
directly accessing the information it

553
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,559
makes a complete copy of the

554
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,630
phone memory once you have access to the

555
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,100
file system and the possibility of

556
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,050
taking also the data that has been

557
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,740
deleted at the file system level

558
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,900
but there are examples soon the

559
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,220
interesting thing that begins to

560
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,590
spread protection system

561
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,870
this you see is called ip box

562
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,179
what is it is a case that you attach to

563
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:25,059
a previous generation iphone is

564
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,670
simply if you  you do not have the pin,

565
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,340
try all the impossible ones until

566
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,410
it finds the right one and basically unlocks your

567
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,750
phone on the  the screen

568
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,610
is applied a brightness sensor

569
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,190
that when it changes brightness because the

570
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,350
phone has been unlocked stops and

571
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,570
on the display writes what the pin is

572
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,759
then obviously

573
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:47,929
obviously apple has tried to

574
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:49,970
countermeasures and then little by little

575
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,570
things have evolved well

576
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,490
let's move on today  how we are

577
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,490
with anas and mobile terminals then

578
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,440
we can say that in 90 percent of

579
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,350
cases we are in great shape

580
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,090
I say why very well because 90

581
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,830
percent of the market is in the hands of the

582
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,289
operating system called

583
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:11,690
android android is a

584
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,659
very nice operating system  and partly open source

585
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:16,759
and partly use of proprietary drivers but

586
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:19,190
a big advantage that a

587
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,299
security package with an operating system

588
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,370
around once was said of windows

589
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,279
now we can say it of android think

590
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,840
that only last year

591
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,990
the beauty was discovered  of 50 grave abbots

592
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,720
who give totally access to any

593
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,049
part of the system so if you want

594
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:38,840
as they say give your own  re given

595
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,490
to anyone buy an

596
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,259
android phone and it will be very useful especially

597
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:43,399
if someone wants to snoop

598
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:46,070
inside your lives on the other hand

599
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,409
we have a whole series of

600
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,529
less popular operating systems many is

601
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:53,419
a saying like those of microsoft who

602
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:54,740
managed to do one thing  strangely

603
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,700
working and ios and that instead except if

604
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,679
you are an Arab activist they do not give you

605
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,320


606
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,700
snatt lenses and if you were born with an Arab view

607
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,889
for a few million euros then

608
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:08,809
we will also talk about that the

609
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:11,480
interesting thing what it is that you wanted

610
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,250
not only the terminal  level

611
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,110
of computing power memory everything else but we

612
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,639
also wanted the network underneath

613
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:19,730
so we went from a gprs that

614
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,830
went fast like a lame hamster

615
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,470
to the law that seemed like what revolution

616
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,960
then came to the ca spa and the networks

617
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,539
lte now we have networks that make a

618
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:31,639
few tens of megabits per second and

619
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:33,200
in short, the thing in short is particularly

620
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,019
interesting not only but then

621
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:38,330
the apps came out and that c  dare there what

622
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,090
the apps have done the apas have given us

623
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,100
the impression that everything we

624
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,230
have on our phone is on

625
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,980
our phone a reality is not so

626
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,140


627
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,890
blood or as a famous one says a famous

628
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,560
film that came out recently on  cloud

629
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,890
is a [ __ ] mystery and therefore who knows

630
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,630
where they ended up so what

631
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,940
it basically means that now

632
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,250
the analysis becomes more complicated because it

633
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,860
does not concern only the terminal that is

634
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,200
the apparatus in the sun but the apparatus as a

635
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,700
terminal of cloud services and here  then the

636
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,830
matter becomes

637
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,060
complicated not from a technical point of view

638
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,800
but merely from a legal point of view

639
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,480


640
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,220
because if I do an analysis of

641
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,900
a terminal and discover for example that

642
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,520
not on an android system and I pass they

643
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,410
are not saved in an encrypted way

644
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,030
but in the clear  and all the passwords to

645
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,400
access the various cloud services I can

646
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,870
get them considering that they are needed

647
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,760
abroad

648
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,620
and from there a pandora's box opens that is not

649
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,020
easily manageable, that is, a few

650
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,460
pg waves  who invents interesting things

651
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,320


652
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,150
then what happens the

653
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,380
analysis systems do their evolution

654
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,750
or public faith something that is the cloud

655
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,220
extractor that allows you to extract

656
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,560
information from cloud systems that are

657
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,930
connected to the terminal obviously you

658
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,060
know that I have faith in a product

659
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,580
Italian not to

660
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,720
carry on from clichés about

661
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,670
Jews also pay for the air you breathe

662
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,490
then support for Chinese

663
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,260
and pay phones and support for the cloud is

664
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,880
paid and support for other things is

665
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,890
paid

666
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,960
and so are our friends from oxygen

667
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,670
forensics  suite despite being from

668
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,930
eastern europe have learned their

669
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,460
lesson and then have thrown out the

670
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,050
new version of o xingjang is called

671
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:27,100
detective that costs a kidney

672
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,390
who has the possibility to do

673
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,810
the extraction directly from the cloud as

674
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,030
I tell you the technique goes one way  the

675
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,710
law goes on the other hand so the fact that it

676
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,240
is technically possible to manage

677
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,240
these things does not authorize you to do it

678
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,630
except with the necessary

679
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,370
then we also have the cracking part

680
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,560
because the cracking part because

681
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,740
as I told you all the producers are

682
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,600
trying to carry on the banner

683
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,910
of the protection of

684
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,490
their consumers' information all of you have followed

685
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,130
with great concern the speech of the

686
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,750
San Bernardino massacre

687
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,100
at that  who said he would never

688
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,090
give the key the black pissed off spy

689
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,040
donald trump who shot [ __ ]

690
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,010
as usual and on so what happened

691
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,990
in the end was split because because

692
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,670
there are always soft mistakes of the

693
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,590
vulnerable ts similar

694
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,960
but let's say that all this cancan  has

695
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,060
meant that there is a very strong

696
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,850
enforcement on the protection part

697
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,610
that then maybe they are eludable that is

698
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,890
another matter

699
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,430
ok so what happens for example

700
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,110
the encryption part of an iphone is

701
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,620
extremely difficult to split indeed

702
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,510
practically I could say impossible to

703
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,040
split because  all part of the

704
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,140
certificates are placed within

705
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,890
a par  te of chips at 9 to 10 that cannot

706
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,020
be sold within a

707
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,460
microsoft system

708
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,340
there is a tpm chip so if you want to

709
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,090
enable encryption it

710
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,770
basically uses

711
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,020
bitlocker technology takes certificate and

712
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,050
slips it into tpm and this makes it difficult

713
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,540
one thing if you have an android system to

714
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,850
me if you have an android system

715
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,900
information is already available on the

716
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,970


717
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,470
net so what can you do

718
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,470
you can for example try to bypass

719
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,500
the operating system protections and

720
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,750
then at this moment in addition to the

721
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,900
analysis software you  is returning to a

722
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,090
bit of healthy electronic hacking what it

723
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,310
basically means that we

724
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,860
go to collect the information

725
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,980
avoiding as always happens to

726
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,810
have the operating system in the way that

727
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,700
requires us to authenticate passwords and the

728
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,490
like then it is clear if you have a

729
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,780
fingerprint reader  that is, in order to

730
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,930
cheat it and more but what happens

731
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,060
here we have two examples this is called

732
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,350
tf box and that is called riff box are

733
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,400
of what is called ok

734
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,560
interface boxes that tend not to

735
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,870
be born to do forensic analysis or

736
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,360
data extraction directly

737
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,640
by law enforcement agencies or else they

738
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,980
were born to do anything but change the

739
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,050
firmware makes the phones that

740
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,320
maybe have had to be resurrected  problems with a flash

741
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,060
unlock phones that were yes block

742
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,120
other these interfaces work at a low

743
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,080
level they work directly

744
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,720
on the electronics before the

745
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,360
operating system starts so for example how can I

746
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,249
make a flash directly using

747
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:26,289
the circuits in the motherboard maybe with

748
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:28,960
a jtag port so I can  also to

749
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,389
connect to extract the information

750
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:32,830
clear if the phone is encrypted that is

751
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,080
another matter but if the phone does

752
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,879
not have it or encrypted I am slamming my

753
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,860
snout on the authentication part

754
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,509
when the operating system has started

755
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:42,639
take the information from underneath  the

756
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:43,929
nose allows me to go and pull

757
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:46,179
out everything I need so much so

758
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:48,039
that you can  ò playing in tandem because for

759
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,659
example I was talking about the oxygen

760
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:52,119
forensics suite today oxygen forensics

761
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:54,669
suite has an advantage that you can

762
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:56,159
feed it

763
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,139
directly with the acquired files it travels the

764
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:02,440
tags that is you give them a dump of

765
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,629
a flash that I certainly enter from the phone

766
00:29:04,629 --> 00:29:07,389
oxygen does the analysis of the dump pulls

767
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:09,460
out data and makes the extraction from you

768
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,610
on the phone and then you have the

769
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,749
possibility to access all the

770
00:29:13,749 --> 00:29:15,909
information even if the system

771
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:18,789
blocked them very cool colt gun

772
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:20,460
you want to see it is called dolphin clip

773
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,570
since  otherwise you have to do the

774
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,279
soldering from the ends with a series of

775
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,139
adapters what you do priest the phone

776
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,549
the first exponent the motherboard

777
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:28,929
you put it under this clip mediate

778
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:30,820
the right adapter squeezed the clip

779
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,129
lowered it touches the

780
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:34,659
contacts directly ischia da madre

781
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:36,490
maintains the  pressure extracts all the

782
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,980
necessary information

783
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,129
very nice costs little and works well

784
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:43,840


785
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,480
other to the system microsoft says ah but i  or

786
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,850
do you care because I say that all the

787
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,080
phones that come out of my factory

788
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,110
must have the jtag port burnt

789
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:56,799
so what happens you

790
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,690
can go directly to the ports

791
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,059
mmc what does it mean that when you

792
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:02,889
have a soc there tends to be a

793
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:05,200
single one  single chip that contains

794
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,580
all that is the electronics of

795
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,549
your system in the pins below if you

796
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:11,139
go to look at the information

797
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:13,720
you will find that there are four contacts that

798
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,360
are the mmc interface with which and I know that

799
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,779
it interfaces with the chips that are there  of

800
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:21,249
flash memory that are on the

801
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:23,860
motherboard so what do you do you go to

802
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,289
make four solders and pull four

803
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:28,000
cables connected

804
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,400
to one of the two boxes below at that

805
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,990
point you are connected directly

806
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,690
to the tracks with which to control the food

807
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,700
through the standard and  mmc that a

808
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,650
standard is done and from there you extract the

809
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,870
necessary information

810
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,850
but as I told you there is the problem of

811
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,770
encryption

812
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,550
so what is the next step that

813
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:51,280
st  we manage what concerns the

814
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,790


815
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,590
various trojans

816
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,390
as they say governments have

817
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,700
different approaches to the problem

818
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,650
there are those who say how france we take

819
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,080
the legal encryption

820
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,140
there are those who try to regulate

821
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,640
the use of a trojan for example

822
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,680
germany has done  yes to write

823
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,190
your own system that allows you to

824
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,600
infect systems and extract

825
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,790
information using an agent that

826
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,800
has slipped into the phone and which then allows you

827
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,300
to extract the information both

828
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,160
those created on the network and those that

829
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,510
are encrypted within the file

830
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,650
system

831
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:29,110
there is  a state like italy that is

832
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,440
using hydrogen 2004 in order to

833
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,000
allow the pg to

834
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,920
basically do intelligence that is what

835
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,470
happens they send you a trojan they discover

836
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,840
what happens that coincidentally there is

837
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,510
a random check on that road

838
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,120
when it passes  a lot of

839
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,800
drugs inside that car and

840
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,240
they know very well that it is in a

841
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,300
blue suitcase under the passenger seat

842
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,750
then the coupon has been removed  purpose from the point of

843
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,150
view of fighting crime if

844
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,300
we are in a state of law in

845
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,650
theory intelligence makes intelligence the pg

846
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,870
makes the pg things should not hybridize it

847
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,600
seems that in Italy there is now

848
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,880
the will to succeed in

849
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,590
normal  using one of these cases, however,

850
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,730
let's say that it is not

851
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,130
particularly interesting, that is, it is not

852
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,710
particularly simple I have

853
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:22,570
shown you the a product called hp

854
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,920
elite x3 it is a case that will be released

855
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,130
tomorrow it seems to me tomorrow basically

856
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,070
what it is is one  smartphone with

857
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,220
windowsmobile 10 on board comes in a kit

858
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,429
that includes the smartphone a laptop

859
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:41,799
that in effect is a laptop no

860
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:44,230
sorry they did not put the photos I

861
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:47,520
got lost but there

862
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,070
was no other photos a stupid car that you

863
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,620
use the  phone as the

864
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,090
data processing system

865
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,860
but it shows you the largest applications

866
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,500
and keyboard input and a

867
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,130
doc like this that is connected to a

868
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,419
monitor allows you to have the screen

869
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:06,760
of the  phone and at the same time a

870
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,309
Windows 10 desktop this solution

871
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:11,919
hp sells it together with a

872
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,510
virtualization system that allows you to

873
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,179
send you x86 applications because

874
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:18,549
with this thing you can mount me directly

875
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:20,409
via updated from the office server

876
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:23,380
because this interesting thing is still

877
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,940
interesting because basically at

878
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,390
companies have discovered that controlling

879
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,750
employee devices has a problem and

880
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,000
controlling pc is a problem if I give you such

881
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,980
a case where I can

882
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,049
encrypt it check via policy

883
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,429
push you the things I

884
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:42,309
need delete things

885
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:45,190
remotely control you  everything you do

886
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,919
costs me less the risk of losing less

887
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,289
data one of the biggest

888
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:51,580
excuses that have been made in

889
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,059
recent years is bring your own device

890
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,679
because because I bring my device to the

891
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:58,299
company the company says yes so you don't

892
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:00,789
I pay for my cell phone but I take away a

893
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:03,490
lot of your stuff so the game is

894
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,830
usually not worth it  ndela this is one

895
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,139
of the reasons why

896
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:10,030
nowadays we are trying to push

897
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,609
more and more on the mobile analysis part

898
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:15,149
compared to the pc analysis part

899
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:18,849
because it seems at least from the latest

900
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:21,820
technological and technological trends that this

901
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,280
will actually be what can

902
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,679
be the next frontier

903
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,460
of  'analysis of

904
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,599
personal computer analysis sorry here

905
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,190
this is something that recently came out

906
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,190
on kickstarter

907
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,050
they wanted to reach 50 thousand euros they

908
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,830
reached 850 thousand euros is a docking

909
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,739
station in the shape of a laptop that can be

910
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,719
connected to an android phone or a

911
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,550
windows mobile phone and gives you the

912
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,168
opportunity to take advantage of your

913
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:52,829
active laboratory community phone but

914
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:55,559
with the convenience of the accused towards a

915
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:57,390
generous person for this it makes you understand where

916
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,130
we are going to end there are 45

917
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,579
projects this the pupa of the hp x3 that

918
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:04,130
go in  this direction

919
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,359
this is another example of another

920
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,219
project that was on indigo doing

921
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:11,099
exactly the same thing

922
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:14,069
so at this point what to say how

923
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:17,119
we are with the analysis systems well

924
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,619
basically a bit behind with the

925
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,719
trojans how we are in a very bad way to

926
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,749
give you an indication of the same company

927
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:27,839
that I mentioned earlier for the speech of the

928
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,519
type that dealt with human rights in

929
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,410
Saudi Arabia that  is the n if an

930
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,390
Italian company that makes trojans has

931
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,430
substantially under the table declared

932
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,700
this thing that is able to infect

933
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,769
having only the phone number of the

934
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:46,469
target no other data 97 percent

935
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:49,559
of android devices

936
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:53,239
60 percent of devices or sx

937
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:57,390
zero day  apart from and 2 percent of

938
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,849
windows mobile devices,

939
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:02,699
in my opinion it makes us think that it

940
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:04,410
makes us think because the

941
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,299
mobile analysis systems are much more advanced

942
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:09,059
even though they are behind the

943
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:11,459
part of the latest protection techniques

944
00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:13,079
that the manufacturers have put in place.  much

945
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,009
further than we think they

946
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:15,930
extract much more information

947
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,819
than we think we often

948
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:19,410
have u  n false sense of protection

949
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,539
thinking that having a device in your pocket is

950
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:23,039
more than enough reality this is

951
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:25,380
always on in all respects so it is

952
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,329
prone to a series of scary attacks

953
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:30,180
and sometimes issuing a trojan in here

954
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,459
is much easier than it seems

955
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:34,469
using a  update a fake update

956
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:36,420
rather than anything else so the thing

957
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,979
in my opinion is to be particularly taken

958
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:40,609
into consideration

959
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:45,559
ok it does not go further and therefore I tell you

960
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:48,119
questions thank you for your attention and there

961
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,660
are

962
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,789
questions existential matters other things that

963
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:52,359
interest

964
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:55,500
you please

965
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,710
yes no

966
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,289
in  reality was very clear the

967
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:14,890
speech that receiving the position there is a

968
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,140
risk factor however that has not been

969
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,670
mentioned if intentionally or but opens a

970
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,079
possible attack front that it is

971
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:25,450
precisely the applications

972
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,220
I work in a company that its

973
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,170
dynamic analysis of  security on

974
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:31,930
mobile apps and if the operating systems have

975
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,880
a series of control and

976
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,460
device protection tools, the vast

977
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,809
majority of  risk actors

978
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:38,920
instead comes from what we install

979
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,640
in this disk of 100 absolutely

980
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,960
true it is also true that the systems that

981
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,569
then android was not thought to

982
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:52,210
be a business system ok there are

983
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,680
a whole series of programs and

984
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,630
software houses that use that

985
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,299
install  of the control modules with

986
00:37:58,299 --> 00:37:59,799
which they block the phone etcetera

987
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:01,930
etcetera but I tell you the lab

988
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,299
is finished I ran out of phones of

989
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:06,940
all kinds with corporate control systems

990
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,279
of all genes there was

991
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:11,680
one that lasted more than an hour

992
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,500
about all pass me the term gutted

993
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,000
open pulled out everything you

994
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,520
need so if there is found love it

995
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,049
means that when there is interesting company information above them,

996
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:21,010


997
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:25,510
the other thing is how

998
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,400
rightly you say those who want to sell

999
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,819
business phones and a seems it seems to

1000
00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:32,589
say it seems if they don't change their mind in the

1001
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:34,089
next fifteen minutes how could it

1002
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:35,589
happen that microsoft wants to

1003
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:38,289
address this  type of user

1004
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:40,510
their provisioning system tends to

1005
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,279
be extremely tight at this

1006
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:43,630
time so it could be

1007
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,849
interesting it is true that for example

1008
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:47,890
as I spoke to you before all those who say

1009
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,109
that I install trojans on android

1010
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:53,170
is because they send you fei cup fake updates

1011
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,260
and the like  and the phone digests of

1012
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,349
everything

1013
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:01,220
legitimate it up we invest both that

1014
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,339
south

1015
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:06,229
and precisely for how it is developed the

1016
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:08,930
culture penalty of those who develop that does not

1017
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,440
implement correctly to exploit or

1018
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,869
ask you for all the rights the

1019

pokémon state  go when you laugh but I

1021
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,579
princi tavo first a company that a

00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:25,119
roxanne forensic suite

1023
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,499
last month thrown out there is the

1024
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,450
new update that extracts metadata from

1025
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,420
pokémon go so where have you been that

1026
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,249
post visited the pokémon you

1027
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:36,710
found but it is useful  with whom you

1028
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,989
fought because so you discover with whom he

1029
00:39:38,989 --> 00:39:40,999
had to deal and the like that is a

1030
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:43,069
quantity of the scary ones because when

1031
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:44,599
we know  We let an app of who is this app to

1032
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:47,989
these rights yes so much I want to play

1033
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:49,450
right ahead

1034
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,660
other questions

1035
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:02,569
I instead wanted to ask you I arrived

1036
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:05,059
late pd I don't know if already addressed and it

1037
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:06,319
is not put on phones but on

1038
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,880
bracelets that still connect

1039
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,219
to phones

1040
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:11,960
very cool yes  even the fantastic one no

1041
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,609
because I will give you a stupid example

1042
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:16,150
because it happened to me it is interesting

1043
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,319
I talk to the person and mitch and ke cabbage

1044
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,289
do you want me to give a damn about the fact

1045
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:23,239
that I mean the fitness bracelet and I

1046
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:25,640
do them yes but if the bracelet of the

1047
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,979
fitness even the gps checks the

1048
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:30,079
beats and I discover that at three in the

1049
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,029
morning you are in a night club with a heart that

1050
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,999
does everything your wife would not be happy

1051
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,619
to know

1052
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:38,719
and this has turned purple because

1053
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,039
sometimes we are the first to not

1054
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,210
realize these  but like

1055
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,140
digital assistants cortana sirigu gol now

1056
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,880
tons of information that you

1057
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,299
get from you that ends up in the cloud

1058
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:51,950
so certainly that a big

1059
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,259
vector of  risk but also interesting

1060
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:55,700
from an analysis point of view that is

1061
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,170
if I want to make me your khakis with

1062
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,910
the film bracelet I will manage very interesting things out

1063
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,479


1064
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,220
and then I wanted to ask

1065
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,050
you too do you think that this information

1066
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,270
that is obtained is pleased with fitness there

1067
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,050
will be commercialization in the future  of

1068
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,560
material such as supplements medicines

1069
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,240
everything that looks at the

1070
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,609
business then happened to the business and to

1071
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:26,040
human perversion I do not set limits

1072
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,890
so there is no I do not see why not that is

1073
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,080
under the pc you think a few years ago the

1074
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,720
google deputy said damn you with your permission

1075
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,820
them who are politically

1076
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,190
correct what we would like to get

1077
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,859
is the phone that tv the priests say do you

1078
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:42,270
remember the t-shirt you looked at

1079
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,800
the other day on amazon well three

1080
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,100
windows further you find it on the shop

1081
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,740
this tells you a lot about why it is there

1082
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,170
android and why so widespread and why it has

1083
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,940
been pushed so hard but

1084
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,160
just as much but google let's say

1085
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,680
that it is its core business fars  The

1086
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,200
users cack the others if they

1087
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,420
do them but let's say in a bit more

1088
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,970
strip

1089
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,040
on ebay with headlights that do what I

1090
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,400
sell you the shirt telling you that you are

1091
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,450
looking for something and then you see you

1092
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,290
little note for the record my

1093
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,540
friend went to america  to buy

1094
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,420
intimate hygiene products ok you paid

1095
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,290
at the checkout she went out and we see a

1096
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,300
discount coupon to buy the same

1097
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,180
products you just bought or went out she

1098
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,530
came back bought them with the

1099
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,990
coupon but this is a lover I say

1100
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,090
that edison is already successful  in two who

1101
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,070
tell me that they recently went

1102
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,440
to the United States were drawn at

1103
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,330
random and on the squeezes at random then

1104
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,340
we arrive in many and they said

1105
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,619
put the phone here that we

1106
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:51,390
connect a cable and take out

1107
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,250
some information will be a step  the

1108
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,930
customs

1109
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:58,170
here so this makes you understand how

1110
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,330
this repository of

1111
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,910
personal information is very valid for a lot

1112
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,770
of things and contains much more than

1113
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,580
what you maybe  thought my

1114
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,470
questions are these before saying that

1115
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,300
no system has resisted etcetera

1116
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,490
etcetera and android

1117
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:18,940
check point company was selling a solution a

1118
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,560
cloud a cloud something like that

1119
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,500
for which they said they guaranteed

1120
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,290
protection any device you know

1121
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:28,510
this solution then I know the

1122
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,820
one of  shortdo I know 78 that one

1123
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,440
says how many cola rita I've never

1124
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,940
seen it so I don't want to say one thing

1125
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,730
for another but the conversation is as long as

1126
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,220
where an encrypt the device and

1127
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,250
put the keys out of the device

1128
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,830
I open things to you  an example I take

1129
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,760
a samsung s6 with one of these systems

1130
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,950
that encrypts

1131
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,770
the file system it is clear that the key

1132
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:55,750
must be on the device otherwise it does

1133
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,760
not boot it is not that there are many saints what

1134
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,870
I do connect or flash a recovery

1135
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,400
also I can not take the  route because

1136
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,990
there is the system that prevents me flash

1137
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,450
from new recovery within recovery

1138
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,730
I dump the memory in the

1139
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,770
memory the key  and I find it for sure that

1140
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,650
I open the phone I say hello hello

1141
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,480
and the question and in the end what is the

1142
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,810
system the smartphone can think to be

1143
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:22,690
safer I know it makes you laugh it seems an

1144
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:25,600
oxymoron but at this moment in

1145
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,720
my opinion windows 10 at this moment I tell you

1146
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,730
I have not found the praise in the hands of people

1147
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,670
who do this job like me and the last ones

1148
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,220
have said heck

1149
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,320
so for now also because it has little

1150
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,940
market also because it is not known even

1151
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,340
for a whole series of reasons that you want

1152
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,700
this thing a black beast because

1153
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,170
once  that you have encrypted it on the jtag door,

1154
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,270
if you connect to mmc, you don't get

1155
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,830
anything out because the key is

1156
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,690
inside the tpm not as an android that

1157
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,070
put it in a zone of the do-yes of the

1158
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:56,890
memory that however can be accessed does not have

1159
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,510
a fingerprint reader  digital because

1160
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,460
to the iris reader if you put

1161
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,860
a photo in front of the reader of this

1162
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,100
here to a kind of a sensor that

1163
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,320
measures the difference the distance between

1164
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,440
him your

1165
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,670
eyebrow arch and the cheekbone for c  ui with

1166
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,200
a photo is not enough because it does not have the

1167
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,760
same one you should take a 3d print

1168
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,310
of you and your face to put on it

1169
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:19,750
the photo from the other resolution of the

1170
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,060
iris and maybe it opens it to

1171
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,920
you so I say right now if I have to

1172
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,570
entrust something I would

1173
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,980
take  this

1174
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,080
even if less common the one with less up

1175
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,380
and everything you want otherwise

1176
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,640
I would say an iphone until

1177
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,650
last week then from last week I

1178
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,570
got a little [ __ ] and more

1179
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,470
I could not tell you

1180
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,150
a thing about

1181
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:53,410
the key itself  lean krypton

1182
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:56,980
who listens and cyprus from cyprus but no

1183
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,859
then the speech and attention think

1184
00:45:59,859 --> 00:46:01,690
when you digit for example a

1185
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,910
disk with bitlocker in the tpm what

1186
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,680
happens to turn on the pc he asks you for

1187
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,600
the password because the step is for

1188
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,070
decree gr make the key  that then

1189
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:11,440
decrypts the disk this

1190
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,060
android system with a management system

1191
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,369
as he said there is no

1192
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:18,700
I turn on the android and he

1193
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,560
starts the thing considering that I know

1194
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,270
practically  you no android with a

1195
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:24,040
tpm chip on board

1196
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,900
this means that there is a

1197
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,480
clear certificate somewhere if I do

1198
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,390
a mmc dump sooner or later that

1199
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,190
damn certificate telo catto and at that point

1200
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,859
the system is open

1201
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:39,490
while microsoft anti pm  apple has a

1202
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,190
sécure storage inside the soc that

1203
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,050
works exactly like a tpm i.e. it

1204
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,170
can only be queried

1205
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,000
so if I query it but I do not

1206
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,290
query it correctly it does not

1207
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,480
give me the okay and therefore I do not open

1208
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,830
the disk even if I have dumped

1209
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,460
the memory

1210
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:06,079
the only answer and now pro nobis at

1211
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,089
this moment I tell you the truth is up to me

1212
00:47:08,089 --> 00:47:12,470
unless the system is

1213
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:15,529
that is as long as the system is encrypted so it

1214
00:47:15,529 --> 00:47:17,690
means the windows mobile all

1215
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,779
have encryption at this moment but it is not

1216
00:47:20,779 --> 00:47:22,730
activated by default

1217
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:24,410
so  if you like it is not encrypted

1218
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:28,160
so there is no jtag but via emmc field and

1219
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,980
I take out what I need

1220
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,789
because people and it has been rendered

1221
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:37,099
unusable in production if

1222
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:40,329
encrypted you do nothing  and

1223
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:42,500
soon they are the only ones who also make us

1224
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,130
a memory card

1225
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,570
there is in fact this solani towards

1226
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,790
greece is already out is already out is

1227
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,510
in fact also the former ternana storage

1228
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:01,130
but I tell you you latakia a pc if you do not

1229
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:03,500
put the pin  or you do not look at the

1230
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,760
iris reader and the only thing you do

1231
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,160
recharge in case there is only a

1232
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,300
thinker ago exists in the one with the

1233
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,060
photos I even tell you that the individual

1234
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,620
applications or applications are

1235
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,390
encrypted with a different key even

1236
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,710
on the memory card  external because at

1237
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,330
this moment he is quite parliamentary

1238
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:20,870
[ __ ] then maybe maybe then the

1239
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,460
competitor of the reach I tell you I

1240
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,700
can say without fear of denial that if

1241
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,130
I keep my information so much so

1242
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,370
for sure he does not buy an android

1243
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:34,779
then depending on personal tastes

1244
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,480
to turn to  15 Chinese euro is exactly the

1245
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,580
same in all respects to an old

1246
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,040
feature phone so it means that I

1247
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,840
destroy what interests me in one

1248
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,210
way or another by

1249
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:49,310
paying a fed it gives you  one thing that

1250
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:51,920
shining phone sport that has

1251
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,590
an interface with which you can go to

1252
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,480
specific pina extracts the information of

1253
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,160
feature phone type Chinese phones

1254
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,220
those from 15 euros

1255
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:04,040
well of course the 44 text sms address book

1256
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,180
that is in it and we absolutely

1257
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,940
agree  but objectively what you

1258
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,650
do with a phone he made out at this

1259
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,740


1260
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,630
exact moment but I tell you the truth a feature

1261
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:16,430
phone go the phone that is not to you but

1262
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:18,710
it is nothing at that point what you do

1263
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:21,730
is put under wiretapping

1264
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,130
exact

1265
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:31,450
gentlemen thank you very much for the  'attention
