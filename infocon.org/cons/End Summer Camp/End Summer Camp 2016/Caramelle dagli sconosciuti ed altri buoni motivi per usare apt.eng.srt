1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
sky the pentagon to hold on

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:14,849
to yours is here ok ok agree not to

3
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:24,140
move too much hi i'm elena and

4
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,210
contribute de piano i am different

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,058
pilot but i keep 45 packages recently

6
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:36,030
small packages i am here talking

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,570
about why to use debian packages

8
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,149
and not  software especially of those that

9
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:49,620
from third parties of the candies is that an

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,059
initial note

11
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,070
if someone does not understand what I say

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,920
Italian that is an English version on

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,020
that site where a piece is missing on the

14
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,129
slides but the address below works in

15
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,140
other slides there are some  addresses to

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,930
other sources etc and those

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,689
are also on that address want i said

18
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:13,500
melting of candies from

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,400
strangers

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,799
when i was little the parents

21
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,259
told me not to get them candies from

22
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,600
strangers unless there is one of

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,540
us who says yes yes you can  taking them

24
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,509
is a simple rule suitable for

25
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,530
a child who does not know how to recognize a

26
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,619
suspicious person from one of us

27
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,540
and it is a rule that works  ona quite

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,210
well because honestly at home there were

29
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,619
bowl of candies

30
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,960
I wanted candies I could take them from

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,509
there there was no shortage but it was a

32
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,259
rule that served to avoid

33
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,500
ferrari risks but small risk that some

34
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,810
stranger would offer candies with

35
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,469
bad intentions there  it was as long as a

36
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,299
little and it's okay to tell him a rule

37
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,590
avoid that risk unlike

38
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,069
candy for software as

39
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,569
I tend to use only linux so

40
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,950
I don't have the slightest idea how

41
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,489
things work under windows of

42
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,220
valid under mac badly I'm ignoring

43
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,650
beautifully for you not  me things after a

44
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,430
problem of others or under linux

45
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,430
actually there are there are so many people

46
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,480
that of candy there are people who offer

47
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,940
candy to download from suspicious sites

48
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,120
and those oh well it's easy to say maybe

49
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,849
even no there are people who offer candy

50
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:50,220
from  download from the social sites

51
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,420
official site of a bit of a well-known project

52
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,620
then in particular there are

53
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,010
platforms for distributing software  both

54
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,640
for end user applications but

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,120
lived to stay in time

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,849
this time i will talk about libraries in the

57
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,629
suite in the beckett manager

58
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:15,269
for language specific libraries that

59
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:19,040
are on paypal on juan pm

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,900
on that of ruby which was supposed to be

61
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,400
germ but I don't remember the  site name

62
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,019
are references to extremely

63
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:30,170
convenient sites in the sense that they are convenient for those who

64
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,799
develop a library or not and then do it

65
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:35,780
because it says I made

66
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,629
it public it on paypal everyone

67
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:41,239
can read it can download it

68
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,299
take everyone knows where to find it and it's

69
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:46,879
convenient  the developer who says and I

70
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,799
know how to do is what I do a search

71
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,549
on pipes to pm etc. and micov

72
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:00,669
all things bridge from the pocket and clear but

73
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:03,290
anyone can write they are

74
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,269
then taking weapons from strangers

75
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,970
on the other hand using linux there are

76
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,129
sources but they are enough  if the

77
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,769
region really safe if one says

78
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,690
instead of downloading the library after the

79
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,289
files I take the deb package that

80
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:24,130
comes to me from pt game kidnapped  in italy

81
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,560
official depositors of debian

82
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,930
i know that not only someone wrote

83
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,510
the i various a and published it but that there

84
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,820
was another person the maintainer of the

85
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,330
package who downloaded it decided

86
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,510
that it is useful because if one does not  do

87
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,300
something useful or do it to do

88
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,740
someone a favor who finds it useful

89
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,870
or do not do lowes beat to

90
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,860
keep a package has not

91
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,870
checked what is putting on

92
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,470
the bulls field if nothing else is in a

93
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,849
good position to establish a

94
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:01,220
trust relationship with kg develops it

95
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,139
for anyway when one keeps a

96
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,360
package a few times he has to talk

97
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,000
with upstream to realize

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,669
what his practices are and if he does

99
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:13,669
not trust upstream much more work to

100
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,040
do then if just just out he

101
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,420
leaves  the package to someone else

102
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,120
can be considered a source

103
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,480
of software candy that can be

104
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,850
trusted is not perfect but if one does not

105
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,480
just put something in debian that has

106
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,350
problems it loses a bit of  reputation

107
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:48,390
something to lose on account of things

108
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,490
like pipes ai etc

109
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,340
everyone can just write I can

110
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,200
everyone can publish things there is

111
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,030
no human control of what is

112
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,220
landed and funny things can happen

113
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,340
an example was this

114
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,660
that is the address at the bottom of the  of

115
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,480
the research site a guy or

116
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,470
initially published super then and then also in the

117
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,130
stands a series of packages with the

118
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,040
name of the most frequent typing errors

119
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,600
for example python and quest

120
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,660
haunt these things that all

121
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,660
python projects use for that

122
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,490
almost all use them  a

123
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,010
version with a wrong name will be published

124
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,700
the result was that he managed to

125
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,900
infect with code that he

126
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,280
simply contacted both really

127
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,400
from his university a few many

128
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,010
computers nice and funny project

129
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,880
reads the article I did nothing

130
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,180
it took no  effort

131
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,810
i tried the packages left his then the

132
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:15,610
packages parse the files from python

133
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,310
requirements pe  r say any other

134
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,889
merged tripods so he could increase the

135
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:24,880
number of packets from general and

136
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,990
then do some

137
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,800
random generation of names he put up many

138
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,690
packages no one noticed that

139
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,840
I am publishing a lot and with

140
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,930
suspicious names he managed quietly

141
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,160
because in any case he did not  the things made from the

142
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,229
bed these accessories there is no

143
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:48,729
check what is posted

144
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,750
the high thing that had happened this there

145
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,870
was a month more himself outside

146
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,070
the other thing that had happened

147
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,919
who is in the environment will remember

148
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,539
when  of the pm the left pad has been removed

149
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:13,240
that suddenly everything that uses

150
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,050
does not fill me in until they

151
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,599
have deleted the library and there not

152
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,810
only was there a problem of managing the

153
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,630
structure of the place

154
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,000
all publish but there was also  a

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,029
problem of platform managers

156
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:42,159
who have done things a little more skilled

157
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,870
maybe they were taken aback

158
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,480
for something they didn't know how to

159
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,329
manage but they risked doing

160
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,240
damage  around

161
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,200
the world because they left with a

162
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,279
person if he pulled things away then on top of

163
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,600
that there were extremely used things

164
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,120
small extremely used for everything

165
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,790
cascading they did damage instead use

166
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,120
a distribution usually if we talk

167
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,620
about distribution that have a bit of  years

168
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,350
behind means having to deal

169
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,180
with composers' managers who

170
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,160
have seen them all as I said

171
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,070
before and whoever does not know apt sooner or

172
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,839
later has to start implementing them again

173
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,020
implements badly because a distribution

174
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,990
like deviates but what I say deviates

175
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,480
95 percent for fedora and

176
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,070
distributions that don't have a community

177
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:51,029
behind a little less but it can scale

178
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,270
you have a project that has been around for a long

179
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,940
time that knows what it's doing

180
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,649
in the specific case of debian that

181
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,950
has principles based rules and  those

182
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,850
of social contact for which it does not have as a

183
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,680
principle to keep on this infrastructure

184
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,810
for the benefit of a company that does not know

185
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,870
what but there is a community with de  the

186
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,180
rules and in a position to gain the

187
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,640
trust of those of the user

188
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,140
all this I tell him that these

189
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,930
systems are dangerous that other tina I

190
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,790
propose to say more possible to

191
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,860
use packages from the distribution

192
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,520
if there are not some point one goes to

193
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,800
use  then then I go to use

194
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,130
the other systems but to treat them not

195
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,560
as a library source to

196
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,709
depend on but as a source of things to

197
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,779
check it

198
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:04,750
happens to me software development work it

199
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,170
happens to fetch programs

200
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,110
from those library poles from here then

201
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,450
check in the code  and then check

202
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,510
the development mode because in debian

203
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,339
you know that what is released in

204
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:21,550
you have to stable and old is the guarantee

205
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,940
that for about three years it is and is a

206
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,089
serious security bug with some

207
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:34,540
patches for sure it is fixed

208
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,209
security and  the patches are not there it depends

209
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,920
because there is not always someone who

210
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,450
does it

211
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:47,860
but if you can you can do it and instead they are

212
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,010
those of Bari and from the dap hifi you have to

213
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,200
watch the pr  object of will tell us

214
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,380
this makes updates makes them

215
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,370
backwards compatible this other makes

216
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,230
updates every update

217
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,940
breaks everything you have to rewrite all over

218
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,200
again i am writing things that need to

219
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,510
be kept for a few years

220
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,980
that i basically don't use it if

221
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,230
one has to take  packages

222
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,120
around here treat them as an untrustworthy source

223
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,279
and watch what one is

224
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,060
doing after which they are done

225
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,620
beating about checking the code

226
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,310
check how they work upstream it

227
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,470
is done they have three quarters of the

228
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,180
entry needed to maintain a package

229
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,620
in debian

230
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,839
at that point maybe put your

231
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:36,760
hand on the conscience of he said

232
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,920
work I did it we share it

233
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,230
with others we contribute to debian fedora

234
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,020
if on the fedora

235
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,209
I don't know how the packages come in not a

236
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:48,570
hundred be told

237
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,640
I don't know we

238
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,180
contribute and maybe someone else doesn't

239
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,040
it has to get the same beat but if it does it

240
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,690
for another packet and then I can

241
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,280
use it for that

242
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,360
and so with m  inimo more effort you

243
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,610
can all have something better

244
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,600
I don't know if there is time if there are

245
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,840
questions

246
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,480
there was a time for a round of questions

247
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:27,160
if there is someone if I don't do

248
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,500
it what is the procedure for  become a

249
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,770
montaigner of pride then to

250
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,810
keep a package what you

251
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,770
have to do is prepare the package then

252
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,690
there is a procedure that was called this

253
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,600
sponsorship whereby you publish the

254
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,110
package on a bit okay but it is called

255
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,620
mentos and debian developers it

256
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,860
they look at these requests

257
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,450
typically have

258
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,410
errors corrected and then upload with

259
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,710
package sponsors when one does not know of

260
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,390
can easily keep a

261
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,860
package but every time he wants

262
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,100
to upload he has to give it to one of

263
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,430
who does it.  check then

264
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,030
physically upload there is no

265
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,820
formal procedure to do to start

266
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,490
then later you begin to

267
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,990
do formal procedure to get

268
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,310
permission instead of applause

269
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:32,200
say  clearly we still have time for

270
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:45,820
two other mothers both since there is time

271
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,820
maybe it can be useful even within

272
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,940
two types but stay with control if you

273
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,540
think it can make sense has the

274
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,850
ability control even at the level of

275
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,950
it sure to use free software

276
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,950
so on the license when an

277
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,080
entity package with a new package

278
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,580
enters debian it is not only

279
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,070
checked by the maintain and if van thin

280
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,380
air is not of plan di velo for down the

281
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,240
manpower but there is an

282
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,730
additional check done by a team that  they were

283
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,160
called ftp masters that

284
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,370
check above all that

285
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,310
the package licenses respect the

286
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,470
software guidelines deviations that are

287
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,860
at the address before the social with in the

288
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,590
social contact so when a

289
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,970
package ends and is definitely

290
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,940
free software and therefore there are no

291
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,390
surprises such as license  that if but

292
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,490
free but then you look at a clause

293
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,490
and you realize that in reality it cannot

294
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,560
be used in the company where you

295
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,529
work part have prohibited  use

296
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:53,680
for those who develop something who deals

297
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,579
with security

298
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,800
every now and then someone comes up with

299
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,249
licenses except that they prevent

300
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:02,079
specific fields from using specific

301
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,999
no if in debian there is a guarantee not to

302
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:05,740
find such things and then there is the

303
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,779
guarantee  to find yourself with using only

304
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:10,990
free software, however, another one

305
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,579
more check that is done

306
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:15,309
on the weapons then another check that

307
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,220
is done is that I said it is

308
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,339
controlled by the person

309
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:24,910
who uploads another thing that must

310
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,740
always have  more work in the fact for

311
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,410
groups so it is not said that there is

312
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,149
only one person especially for the packages

313
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:33,189
a little bigger

314
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:34,839
it is not just one person to look at it there is

315
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,939
a group that works together

316
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:39,129
and then there are groups within

317
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:42,339
deviates but they do quality control

318
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:46,779
on the whole archive for example there is a

319
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:50,620
group that is working on making sure

320
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,139
that packages can be overturned

321
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:58,480
in a reproducible way that re compiling

322
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,050
all the packages in this however

323
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,539
the objective.  or in this case they also find

324
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:07,809
other bugs and report them and that is

325
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,099
also a way to improve

326
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,199
the quality of what you find and in

327
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,579
any case, among other things, you have the guarantee

328
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,760
that something that is in debian can

329
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,429
actually be recompiled from the sources

330
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:20,289
something that especially in certain

331
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,949
programming languages is not always taken

332
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,699
for granted for example in the java environment there

333
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:29,620
are often sound controversies that can be compiled from

334
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,980
sources but only by inserting a series of

335
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,159
compiled giorgia of all the dependencies

336
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:41,830
san pietro to totally recompile from
