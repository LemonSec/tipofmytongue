1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
ready via hi everyone i am fabio

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,390
carletti from computer security in

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,080
how i work or at least i try to do it

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,980
sorry if i do i

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,620
had to do at half past two but for

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,800
traffic problems and therefore of the

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,289
highway I said we will not put up

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,090
later so that i could do the  talk

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,920
because I could not be lost in the

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,930
middle of here then what I'm going to

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,180
talk about today is the most fire a

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,689
distribution based on ip coop in which

13
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,390
I talk about it because there is a large

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,640
community very very active and why

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,520
as who already asks why in the  do

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,250
with gr sec

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,850
now since, however, even a short time I

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,170
use it a lot from a business point of view

19
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,480
and I am a brand so

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,190
more or less in my area there is the small

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,180
medium company so the most common cases

22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,500
in my area is the classic

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,149
spyware trojan  on the windows mac computer and

24
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,769
also understand the events of different

25
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,380
companies in which there is the classic

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,850
cyber attack on the e

27
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,280
-mail server they send the thousand to

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,380
foreign customers who do not have the  pec saying

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,470
we changed the iban code by chance

30
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,049
and so don't go to africa

31
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,159
etc. etc. fortunately markets

32
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,799
from cases where customers who worked

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,170
for a long time with the company so they

34
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,939
said but I didn't understand as bank transfer I have to

35
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,650
send it on this or on what  first

36
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,079
like the one with the private in capri

37
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,659
calderone in short, for years they still find themselves

38
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,720
with the classic avg free or

39
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,100
updates disabled and then

40
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,299
things were so since that the recent ones

41
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,369
come from Italy it often seems

42
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:57,500
computers as botnets or the use

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,500
that happens to me  it is the classic virus to

44
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,790
steal sensitive data

45
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,090
or to use the computer as a

46
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,760
bridge to carry out cyber attacks

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,620


48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,350
all this because companies are often thought

49
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,850
that

50
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,300
as often I hope you will know they put the

51
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,730
firewall or the plane bought in

52
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,420
place we are ok because we have

53
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,210
tempered our duties so much  from the point of view of

54
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,240
security actually default password

55
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,770
in itself there is a company that made

56
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,920
pre  tenders of tenders I tender for work

57
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,100
a job for security and I was in

58
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,950
the meeting room in the Vatican with the owners

59
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,260
who said look we have this

60
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,360
this this and this and then

61
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,270
we have the wifi network where sometimes the

62
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,790
employees and workers bring their

63
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,769
computers  from home to download as moon

64
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,860
and then I discover that

65
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,870
all the folders and accounting are also shared on the corporate wifi network

66
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,180


67
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,390
I laughed vendea facade reber ass

68
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,800
if you don't like direction between some crimes

69
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,140
in here

70
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,770
ok the job so I'm here  they are

71
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,870
brands so as I said before being

72
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,940
in the small medium company often the

73
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,980
reality is that they wait for them to

74
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,380
beat the teeth of the

75
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,270
computer crime that is there was before

76
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,250
realizing it but perhaps it is the case that

77
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,200
some money is hidden from us we invest

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,060
in IT security

79
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,490
for the  all the rest still something that

80
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,650
happened what downloaded so

81
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,170
then there is autocad and that maybe lead to

82
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,850
addis power of the malware

83
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,120
then oh well it seems it depends  nti that I do

84
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,190
n't give a damn about the company and they are

85
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,700
always waiting for me it happened to computers

86
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,620
where the temperature was more than 100

87
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,070
grams each one turns off the computer it will be a

88
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,190
problem with conductive paste like this but

89
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,900
with the it does not take that I have not seen them

90
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,090
never took screenshots and ovada to my 13th

91
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,089
I put just historical is above

92
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,100
I turn on the lario and then the employees who

93
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,380
came to stand out turn off

94
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,180
the google map to balance

95
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,680
nothing then sorry since

96
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,620
the

97
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,259
discourse of security is also often used even with me

98
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:34,400
in privacy

99
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,889
so  the speech also must be

100
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:38,990
monitored or in any case to have

101
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,050
communications to the outside with

102
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,750
greater safety

103
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,270
all this circus go faster is

104
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,270
that oh well then there were people who still

105
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,180
did not understand that if they do not clean them and the

106
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,850
story files or cookies accelerate  with

107
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,740
crumb mason you go to facebook and you

108
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,389
find yourself advertising the

109
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:01,039
same things that looks coincidentally

110
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,220
bought the but here they already have that  or

111
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,430
that I like that it has to do with amazon no

112
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,199
as they had in care of the world and

113
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,320
facebook has been another part since

114
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,580
then they have understood that if you do not empty the

115
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,410
cache it is so in short let's say that

116
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,699
facebook that according to your cabbage

117
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:23,090
then it's okay  it has happened but it has changed but

118
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,539
as computer security also several

119
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:28,580
factors in which they go to take the

120
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,130
indication side on the file stored

121
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,620
within google chrome or firefox

122
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,389
of windows and therefore often I did not even

123
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:40,400
think that there was a market behind

124
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,710
the industrial espionage of books in

125
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,199
which  the guinea pigs also had by the

126
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,780
police and hand passed some jobs in which

127
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,639
there is the classic writer who lives by

128
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,979
writing books but every book that is like

129
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:54,070
3 4 3 or 4 years to write it because

130
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,169
research does things and there are

131
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:59,360
people who seek  going to steal the

132
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,009
searches makes sure to publish the

133
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:05,229
book first theirs or sun sack

134
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,479
behind unfortunately god said bugs and windows

135
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,220
but here is the solution give today the

136
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,080
hottest engine is more a sorrow  ta of

137
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,419
disclosure because it is a way

138
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,490
using this distribution in which it

139
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,880
is a as before it is a pick off fork but

140
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,460
the very very nice thing is that it is a

141
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,800
very very active community and this is

142
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,810
important in the security field because if

143
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,150
there was any  problem already does some

144
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,590
updating of the

145
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,409
ssl writing library or what I in the

146
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:38,930
queue after having managed it is not that

147
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,919
I can flames the community in which when

148
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,719
one more gracefully when second time

149
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:47,210
we also kiss her no and if it is a

150
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,060
speech  paruolo router must have peace of mind

151
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,550
must be updated within

152
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,979
a reasonable time otherwise when the

153
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:59,960
cabbage speech security what I

154
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,599
wanted to talk about this ip fire in which

155
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:07,099
the screens in which I said is based on

156
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:09,590
linux has already passed the carnet with

157
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,930
self-confident gels already inside  some

158
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,479
interesting goodies to a package manager

159
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,849
his which is called pack fire is a bit of a

160
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:19,130
kind apt get and then pack fire update

161
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,909
pack fire upgrade all manageable by

162
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,389
graphical interface on the 444 and the beauty

163
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,210
that among the packages there is already smart so

164
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,650
installing guardian which is a

165
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,520
package from them

166
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,629
4 from the repositories of the file is so as to

167
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:44,479
have an its here even an eps is already in the

168
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,330
world we see it is easy to

169
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,180
administration in which there is both speech

170
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,419
dhcp proxy all known packages

171
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,729
and among which even later we will talk about

172
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:57,180
privacy

173
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,039
tor among the many nice things that that is

174
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,759
that the management of the logs because it makes

175
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,409
very intuitive graphics in which you allow me to

176
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:09,180
divide between the logs of

177
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,789
firewall proxy and also ips so if I

178
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:16,889
have intrusions or in any case some

179
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:19,139
strange connections to the outside here to

180
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,360
me it records everything then here is passmore

181
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,270
tative this is the screen in which my

182
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,610
services are enabled and if in

183
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,360
this case it was uninhabited night however

184
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,649
many  nice things that snort allows me

185
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,360
to download

186
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,479
both the community rules and the emergent reed rules and

187
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,430
the big one on prescription at

188
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,540
snort sessions that generates the one in code

189
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,260
a  ivoco for the rules and then there is thor

190
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,950
so the door you all know is the

191
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,860
classic nova 90 50 in which anyone

192
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,920
on the side puts it as a browser gateway

193
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,940


194
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,480
the fire put the door is worth 50 and to

195
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,930
navigate the sutor curtains doing the

196
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,210
beautiful is  tower this one here that you can

197
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,190
also consider in which country you

198
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,440
want to go out with me no winning or

199
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,230
put yourself over her or contribute to

200
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,030
your own thor circuit 15 browser

201
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,480
the classic I know if you know torre I repeat

202
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,510
that how does the routing system tower work

203
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,420
that given a  source

204
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,910
allows us to go out in another country and

205
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,560
the known goes down does not know the original

206
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,930
user's lippi but only the router to which

207
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,820


208
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,900
all this has been connected increases the privacy

209
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,600
now the new one goes down but it could also

210
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,060
record what we are doing and

211
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,030
therefore  they are all contraptions in which you

212
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,910
can also use a vpn as

213
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,800
successful on it does not go down so that the

214
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,020
malicious node does not record what we are

215
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,980
doing on the internet

216
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,770
but as you know  IT security

217
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,870
is a process and not a

218
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,610
product we cannot say that we have

219
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,110
achieved it but it is really that we have

220
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,510
approached 1 based on what I have to

221
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,140
do and it uses more or less stratagems

222
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,320
so this is a drawing of that

223
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,360
so that we are at  inside thor

224
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,640
let's say that he cannot know it only on the

225
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,510
previous 9 in which he passed

226
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,090
the information but the request is not the address

227
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,660
of the game and does not

228
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,700
drop it since then you go to the recipient's site

229
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,450


230
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,210
since here the red is clear and  non

231
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,830
teacher can record where we are

232
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,040
going to end with the connection

233
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,380
now this is the screen of thor

234
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,790
inside and for fire

235
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,290
I did it on 3.144 4 and then

236
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,060
here we are at tor it wins when it is consuming

237
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,480
the pid thor enabled I put it  a

238
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,930
means for this example do not give her

239
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,820
exit north I did not put into detail

240
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,890
she also does not know how to decide which band to

241
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,920
use

242
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,430
and takes it to 90 50 thor's classic and

243
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,880


244
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,920
this instead snort in which in quest  or

245
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,930
if I put emergen trade as a

246
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,880
community the rules that are

247
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,050
free resources in which here is a fashion put

248
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,250
what are the different boxes to

249
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,819
choose save my to load the rules

250
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,079
and I go to tick the one that

251
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:38,380
interests me but like there are three

252
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,360
installments between  many rules there is also the

253
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,550
schalke ott

254
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,490
in this case snort chakwal you have to

255
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,980
be a bit smanettoni too

256
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,319
because sometimes they are considered false

257
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:53,450
negatives that is I am downloading from

258
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,630
dai from some server it sees me as

259
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,000
shellcode when in reality it is only

260
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,030
downloading a  solution or some so

261
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,270
nothing strange and then in short these

262
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,430
rules that inside and these

263
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,260
red things can be configured in turn

264
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,740
other rules to say calibrate it because

265
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,410
it is not that I live all right

266
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,080
I'm sure don't worry it's old but it

267
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,300
blocks things that  maybe I don't know

268
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,800
anything strange but it is only that of the

269
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,450
rules snort sees them as something

270
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,260
strange

271
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,970
the beauty that they are also for android

272
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,630
also for mobile so  since

273
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,570
this system hits fire there is also a

274
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,900
package called osta pd I don't know

275
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,460
if you have heard it that allows you to

276
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,670
put the fire on a linux system as an

277
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,110
access point

278
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,880
so it seems to me home or must have

279
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,690
my router firewall with fire and  gone

280
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,150
emergent or even a laptop with

281
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,100
this here or other rules so that

282
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,110
what does not see one of the purely

283
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,680
that makes me scares us with fire shots

284
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,710
so let's say that whoever you think wifi is

285
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,800
doubly protected with different rules

286
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,860
and with him that interesting because

287
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,029
I  has made a similar convenience for people who are

288
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:16,880
stalking or persecuted that

289
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,930
all still with windows who then take

290
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,660
the trojan on duty as a toolbar, however

291
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,350
here it

292
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,140
begins to block incoming outgoing

293
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,990
and strange things all the recorded and

294
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,880
that is all the connections with the port

295
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,579
on  blog and let's say it is convenient

296
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:42,620
these are references then it is more to

297
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,940
make the site is an interesting thing than

298
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,220
the more fire

299
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,290
as I said before is something that but in

300
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,760
an integral way  also retired at work

301
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,390
speaking because it has a community

302
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,769
behind it with updates

303
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:02,089
then obviously in addition to heathrow 86 64 it

304
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:05,300
also makes for a weapon so I tried it both

305
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,570
on the raspberry the last one I also tried it

306
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,290
on the alix those who

307
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,899
play the md game  and then several

308
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:18,339
nice things are formed as a firewall

309
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,709
the installation ranges of between extended

310
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,890
four without four without journaling

311
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:32,870
xfs and bt rfs and less then even one already

312
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,519
the robe wants them to do the classic

313
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:36,769
snowshoeing and so improvised a

314
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:38,779
gentleman access point because among all the

315
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,959
feature that we already have to put too much

316
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:46,510
and then another thing I wanted to say is that

317
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,430
since it is open source and I like to

318
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,529
sponsor this thing of your mind

319
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:55,670
is open source and thanks for your

320
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,070
attention

321
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,019
if you have any questions because

322
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,399
having little time ugo  even running

323
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,140
this

324
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:18,130
some curiosity question but it is not
