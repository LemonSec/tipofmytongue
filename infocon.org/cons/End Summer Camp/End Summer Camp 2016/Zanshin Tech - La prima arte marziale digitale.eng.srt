1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
screensaver to actively prevent

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,299
cyberbullying, solicitations and other

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,370
digital aggressions using

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,010
a slightly out of the box approach that we are now going

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,179
to see

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:25,230
we welcome jean shin bet that is

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:33,109

ok no oil and then we move

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,949

ok then sorry let's turn off  then the cell phones

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,130

12
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,360
claudio cod

13
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,470
he and stefano stack and we are two of the

14
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,390
four founders of the first

15
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,899
digital martial art zen sheen tech

16
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,600
zen sheen tech is a real martial art

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,250
that was born to educate people

18
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,160
you can  from 11 years upwards to the

19
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,580
conscious use of technologies is not a

20
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,380
computer course we do not teach

21
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,420
technological knowledge we form

22
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,750
technological consciousness lozano

23
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,290
cineteca aims at zen in that is

24
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,660
concentration the attentive and

25
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,759
concentrated mind that the martial arts master has

26
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,100
before during  and after the attack,

27
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,690
that is the here and now,

28
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,870
the aim is to train digital warriors,

29
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,480
that is, people able to move  in

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,870
the digital world by recognizing the attacks

31
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,040
the possible attacks that

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,170
they can suffer or that

33
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,829
their friends and relatives can suffer and

34
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:31,019
intervening in a commensurate way

35
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,510
what the attack is therefore without hatred

36
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,760
without aggression maintaining a code

37
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,560
of honor and fundamental respect in

38
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,569
fact  the five rules that we

39
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,849
apply the first and do not attack the

40
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:45,180
second is elected the rite then you will see it

41
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,409
is due to all is a martial art for

42
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:50,700
which it blends what are the

43
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,260
traditional elements of oriental martial arts

44
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,599
so precisely respect code

45
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,519
of honor  management of flows

46
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,250
management of attacks with

47
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,230
cyber security elements

48
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,230
of self profiling osint in

49
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,099
order to be able to manage your

50
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,870
digital identity how this is born

51
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,819
and at the introduction I will now

52
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,549
explain better slowly you will understand

53
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:23,879
what it is  was born three to three

54
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,489
years ago we talked about cyberbullying and

55
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,739
nobody listened to us before we found it

56
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,269
Are the jean shin tech association

57
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,129
that deals with zan scint is that he

58
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,019
and other people met

59
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,190
within an association that

60
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,590
made linux and free software

61
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,129
we had about twenty schools 25 schools

62
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:42,900
that we served by bringing him computers and

63
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,190
building him some

64
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,519
computer labs and in 2013 more or less

65
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,129
we started taking care of two or three of

66
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,479
us within the association which

67
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,049
was much bigger than cyberbullying

68
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:56,250
we wanted to talk to the schools we

69
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,599
went to talk to the schools saying

70
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,220
guys there is this problem is

71
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,290
arriving we should start

72
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,109
thinking about it the reaction we had

73
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,079
was yes oh well but it will never arrive in

74
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:07,590


75
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,569
italy that is okay well there is in germany

76
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:12,659
there is in america there is england there is a bit

77
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:13,949
in belgium there is also  in france but in

78
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,949
italy it will never arrive

79
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:20,130
when after six or seven months

80
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,030
at the beginning of the film at the end of 2013 2014 the

81
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,140
newspapers and televisions began to

82
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,570
talk about caterina picchio of the boy

83
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,490
in the pink pants of u  n series of other

84
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,990
boys and girls who

85
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,470
killed themselves because of cyberbullying

86
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,580
my phone started ringing

87
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,160
madly and it was not only schools in

88
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,290
genoa there were also in catania there were

89
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,960
also in rome there were they called me not

90
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,220
I know very well how they got my

91
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,240
number

92
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,860
to Mr. Canavese come and give us a

93
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,140
lesson come give us lessons of an hour

94
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,600
and a half make the kids aware of the

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,590
problem

96
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,420
one even told me comes so it

97
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,960
scares the bullies a bit so they stop it

98
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,220
as if writing the  smoking kills on

99
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,020
cigarettes ever convinced someone to

100
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,030
quit smoking

101
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,830
we realized that the approach

102
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,510
was not good if we really wanted to change

103
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,160
things by not just becoming

104
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,390
famous like those who

105
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,920
meet in schools talking about cyber

106
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,720
bullying but if you want to solve a

107
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,080
problem

108
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,150
first you study the problem you understand and

109
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,800
try to understand how to intervene

110
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,060
at the base and the underlying problem is that

111
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,430
these guys but also ta  unfortunately adults

112
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,080
go on the net without one without

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,530
attention without sheen zones without

114
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,780
mental focus ok you had to

115
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,970
change the head of the boys like you

116
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,710
change the head of a boy of 11 12

117
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,730
years not with a class course of

118
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,690
an hour and a half need a process  long and

119
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,740
above all we said to ourselves what

120
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,990
changed our minds I did

121
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,060
judo for a lifetime he did karate

122
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,250
john even the traditional martial arts

123
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,320
have a way of seeing the

124
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,120
world that shapes you and you carry it

125
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,330
with you throughout your life.  sense of honor

126
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,830
and respect of never attacking

127
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,020
first of not responding to hatred with

128
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,910
other hatred but simply accompanying

129
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,240
the attack and letting go of all these

130
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,580
things could be used to

131
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,190
change the boys' head then

132
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,500
we studied cyberbullying with

133
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,150
the  'idea of saying let's try to apply

134
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,270
martial arts methods and we

135
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,890
did a very simple thing when you

136
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,540
don't know how it works one thing you

137
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,820
do

138
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,940
is smo  ntate we did the same

139
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,350
thing with cyberbullying and with

140
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,569
solicitations we decided

141
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,460
neither to attack some stories that are

142
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,199
famous others that we found ourselves

143
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,429
that were still in progress we

144
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:40,740
monitored it through a series of

145
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,939
keywords you can find

146
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:44,069
all the  attacks that are on ask on

147
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,349
facebook on instagram we have made a

148
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:47,639
database of bad words which is an

149
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,349


150
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:51,330
incredible thing we have dismantled it we started to

151
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,729
analyze these attacks we have

152
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:55,319
discovered that at the base of the

153
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,509
cyber bullying of solicitation but also of

154
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,369
online scams against the

155
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:02,580
cyber naran assmann adults so blackmails you there

156
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,580
are always the same techniques 10 12

157
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,159
techniques that are always the same

158
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:09,589
then here we had a martial art

159
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:11,849
we could teach these techniques

160
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,419
we could teach the kids to

161
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,619
teach them to recognize these

162
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:17,999
techniques not to tell the world there  he has it with

163
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:19,889
me to say I'm an [ __ ] he is doing the

164
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,389
hicks technique to me because the hicks technique has

165
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:21,990
a no  I

166
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,909
therefore no longer feel it as my problem

167
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:27,809
and I recognize it from myself

168
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:29,550
after which counter moves were needed

169
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,709
we studied cases that ended

170
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:34,830
well we have combined these

171
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,409
concepts of martial arts so precisely

172
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:38,729
management of flows management of

173
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,379
aggression let pass

174
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,559
the aggressor and we have developed a

175
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,169
series of counter-moves that

176
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:47,249
work in what are

177
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:50,519
digital attacks not to the machine

178
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,889
but to the human being

179
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,180
then we deal with

180
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,849
digital conflict between human beings

181
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,589
I'll briefly explain how a

182
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:00,689
jean shin tech gym works  we have been

183
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,279
active since 2014

184
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,379
since 2015 we have a gym active in

185
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:07,529
pavia too here we have without the rebus

186
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,329
also with the bracelet then we will explain

187
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:12,089
what these bracelets are in the

188
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:13,589
gym it works so the boys

189
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:15,509
arrive boys or adults it

190
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:18,719
depends on the mountain course computer that

191
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:20,339
already one thing that  many of them have ever

192
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,659
seen a computer in their life they are

193
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:23,699
used to cell phones and here  n of data

194
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,079
they learn a bit how a computer

195
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,809
did the workstations are assembled after those who

196
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:30,149
work in small groups or individually

197
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:32,818
obviously each evolves with

198
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:35,159
his own times it is not a course it is not something

199
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,559
that I explain once how

200
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,839
something works and I do for  assuming that then you

201
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,549
look at your notes

202
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,188
yes you go back to things you go back over and

203
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:45,870
over I'll explain how to trace

204
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,350
an e-mail

205
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,670
I'll explain how to find the

206
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,500
person behind

207
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,170
it from a phone number I'll explain

208
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,019
how calls to facebook bees work

209
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:55,610
for  which you can make

210
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,260
calls directly to bees to

211
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,850
see more things

212
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,250
less things teach you to do osint on yourself

213
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,779
to understand what are the things you are

214
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,870
publishing osint on others but

215
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,959
above all and this is the peak of

216
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,610
teaching

217
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,740
every now and then  let's tell a case that is

218
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,329
what we will also do with you tomorrow and the

219
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:16,010
day after tomorrow in the two laboratories who wants to

220
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,079
come to a laboratory on chin fishing

221
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,730
and then the day after tomorrow a laboratory s  ul

222
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,610
cyberbullying we tell a real case that

223
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,220
ended badly maybe so

224
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,170
we still need an educator we

225
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,820
in that case do not mount the

226
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,350
computers the boys sit all round

227
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,579
because there is a very strong emotional impact

228
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:33,980
and we tell the descent into

229
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,870
hell of a  boy of a girl

230
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,060
who has come to commit suicide to take

231
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,790
his own life for what happened to him

232
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,829
after which the boys themselves make the

233
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:45,079
timeline that is, they take apart piece by piece

234
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,019
the story recognize the

235
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:52,519
salient events and to each event they hook

236
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,459
what are the techniques that they

237
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:58,100
they know and therefore recognize them or

238
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,040
the signs that they might notice in

239
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,110
others because they also

240
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,029
exercise vigilance towards friends

241
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:08,209
relatives classmates

242
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:09,910
being a martial arts course it

243
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,690
repeats itself over and over again

244
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,420
we talk about an attack you have found we

245
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,910
stop and remember how

246
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,440
the attack is called how do you stop which

247
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,199
are the counter moves and the exercises are repeated

248
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:23,149
even the practical exercises of

249
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:24,440
tracing a phone number or

250
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,329
something like that until they become

251
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:27,740


252
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,899
automatic all seasoned with the five rules of the

253
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:33,320
dojo never attack respect for

254
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,569
everyone including my attacker because I

255
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,220
don't hate him my attacker I don't want to destroy him I

256
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,630
am the one he will come back for

257
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,089
I make him pay I let him go I

258
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:43,730
convince him that this is not the case

259
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,579
with me and then what they say in the dojo I

260
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,350
stay in the dojo so kids can

261
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,240
talk about their problems and

262
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,069
what is happening to them

263
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,930
minus two teachers three students present is

264
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,920
one  rule of protection and special as

265
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,399
it was found so that if the without

266
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,149
computer

267
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:04,709
the iris you put them back in place

268
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:07,209
we combined with what are the

269
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,290
knowledge of cyber security of

270
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:17,769
the traditional elements I went on

271
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:20,829
without slides it is fine I

272
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:22,449
will probably continue to go

273
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,319
on without  slide

274
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,050
here it is the traditional elements honor

275
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,529
respect discipline the practices of

276
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,860
entry and exit from the lesson el  a

277
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,490
hierarchy

278
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,240
if then honor respect as I

279
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,499
told you are traditional elements of

280
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:43,230
martial arts are very

281
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,660
strong discipline 7 of rules I leave the dojo

282
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,809
as you found it

283
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,759
because you are a person who has a

284
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,740
code of honor are things that are

285
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,420
very useful  to train the mind of a

286
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,360
child have a great impact the

287
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,970
repetition the practices of entry and

288
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,529
exit there is the greeting at the entrance and

289
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,569
at the exit it is done like all martial

290
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:06,129
arts practically all martial

291
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,199
arts year in the greeting the

292
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:09,850
most meaning  profound of what

293
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,999
you do

294
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:14,889
elements of aggression management we

295
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:16,149
will explain it to you better tomorrow in the

296
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:19,689
workshops and the hierarchy all martial

297
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:21,389
arts or almost all have belts

298
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:23,829
now you are doing a martial art you

299
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:26,799
do not wear black and white

300
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,999
we do not  we have belts we have

301
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:29,499
bracelets also because if you are sitting

302
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,209
in front of the computer you do not see the belt

303
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,079


304
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,579
also these bracelets are short

305
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:35,559
cobra bracelets are typical bracelets

306
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,689
of the survival world are made with

307
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:39,879
real parachute lanyard in make the

308
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,259
older boys for the younger boys

309
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:42,929


310
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:47,309
we had to do the levels the first white

311
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,779
the last black in the middle that colors

312
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:54,339
white orange orange

313
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,170
white green cimetti

314
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,520
because we are nerves and therefore we have

315
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:06,530
the colors of scheme b because we liked it

316
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,480
more even if someone yesterday

317
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,860
told us that instead of pouring we would have to

318
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,770
change the scheme this leaves us with a

319
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,870
lot of levels and the

320
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,930
holy thing is that from the bracelet then we are

321
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,060
considered but it is and therefore the kids

322
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,040
they enter who are at zero white level as

323
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,390
soon as they have achieved the first

324
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,010
white orange level they start in sea area

325
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,590
to the children who are white what

326
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,270
they learned last year so

327
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,250
they have the responsibility and peer

328
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,960
education they have the responsibility to

329
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,580
teach what they know in the meantime

330
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,340
learning new things is crazy

331
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,650
because peer education is very fast

332
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,360
these kids speak to each

333
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,820
other in their own language so  i we had 22

334
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,650
topics for a lesson of an hour and a

335
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,900
half after twenty minutes they had

336
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,090
finished they understood everything they traced

337
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,650
lemay they read the headers as if

338
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,480
nothing had happened

339
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,740
we had to invent a lesson

340
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,140
we give them an hour and a half between

341
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,080
them twenty minutes  they had finished peer education is a

342
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,210
very very important element

343
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,430
because it strengthens, among other things, the

344
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,490
relationship between older boys

345
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,890
larger than a bracelet belt we

346
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,660
had the case of a twelve year old who

347
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,850
taught a 25 year old it was

348
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,560
beautiful because she is very

349
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,750
calm  But she poses 25 does not understand

350
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,970
a [ __ ] and she, however, was beautiful and

351
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,490
the 12 year old took a lot of responsibility

352
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,950
in this I want to tell you a case

353
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,690
of success because now here we talk about

354
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,650
many things but ok I explained to you let

355
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,860
's say the elections let's tell these cases what it

356
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,660
brings  all this on February March one of

357
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,640
our little girl already orange white bracelet

358
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,690
so she has already done an

359
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,420
analyze sheen tech at 14 years  let's

360
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,250
call her beatrice it's not her name

361
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,660
now they'll tell me that i always tell stock

362
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,560
asthma is important beatrice 14 years old and

363
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,020
her cell phone rings at home it's a

364
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,070
facebook notification

365
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,000
on the other side there is

366
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,230
sixteen cute make friends then they

367
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,730
start accepting with the

368
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,820
facebook chat she 14 he 16 he campino has a

369
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,090
profile with all the photos

370
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,650
except that beatrice is not

371
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,390
an ordinary girl any girl

372
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,130
would have been would have chatted she would have

373
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,810
done the scene with fabio for quite a

374
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,610
few months and then who knows where they would be

375
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,160
gone

376
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,390
beatrice was trained to

377
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,120
check every new every new

378
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,060
contact she has and although beatrice is a

379
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,760
basket case in the sense that some

380
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,260
educators told us what to waste

381
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,850
time because when she arrived she was in a

382
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,380
lot of trouble she is not just any teenager

383
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,420
a  teen will be messed up

384
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,720
with serious problems the problems we

385
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,110
normally have usually are anorexia

386
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,780
self harm bulimia i.e things

387
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,280
if seizure  panic

388
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,680
the attention deficit because

389
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,090
then the adolescent children have

390
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,940
a lot of demons inside this

391
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,230
girl anyway we have trained

392
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,010
well then while the city with fabio 16

393
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,160
years knows by applying a system a

394
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,900
concept of martial arts that

395
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,490
we show you tomorrow that is if I am

396
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,380
I also move my attacker he moves

397
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,230
because he follows me he knows he has to check it

398
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,490
then you tell him why we don't go

399
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,900
to whatsapp he takes him to whatsapp from

400
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,150
whatsapp he extracts they are less than his cell phone and

401
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,400
tracks him and discovers that fabio of

402
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,770
16 is actually called alessandro enea  25

403
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,589
has a Nazi extremist profile on

404
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:37,710
facebook from novara is registered with 56

405
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,190
dating sites and somewhat questionable sites

406
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,930
and is a pedophile who is trying to

407
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,930
lure him applies the sixteen year old verse

408
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,600
pretending to be a sixteen year old applies

409
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,950
the triangle rule that one of

410
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,589
our techniques  more basic defense

411
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:54,240
ie call other people so as not to

412
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,610
be alone call and call other

413
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,600
people

414
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,610
us c  we start tracing this

415
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,960
guy again and we verify that it

416
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,319
is actually alessandro and not fabio after which

417
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,579
she writes to fabio with whom she continued to

418
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,609
accept because she kept him warm and

419
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,880
writes him calling him alessandro

420
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,679
blasphemy alessandro i know who you are

421
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,079
off the [ __ ]

422
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,619
because he is 14 years old not  is that there is some and

423
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:25,640
then hinted flat alessandro

424
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,179
replies pecked point and does not

425
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:30,340
show up

426
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,049
after which we also hear rebus because

427
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:34,820
I mean that here is a 16 year old

428
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,769
and a 25 year old who pretends to be a sixteen year old

429
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,450
let's talk a little with him then talk  with the

430
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,740
girl who does not want to

431
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,570
show the chats because for any

432
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,909
project she is a bit messed up and then we

433
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,620
realize that the whole version

434
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,809
lasted ten minutes that is this guy didn't

435
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:49,789
have time to say anything that

436
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:51,590
could incriminate him she was  too

437
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,850
good reports we report the profile to

438
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,269
facebook which closes it in 24 minutes

439
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:01,250
after which no trace of alessandro anymore

440
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,779
this happened because

441
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:07,220
beatrice was successful  to trace a

442
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,720
telephone man not because we

443
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,760
taught her with a computer course and

444
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,100
she went to look at her notes but

445
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,110
because with the repetition with the rules

446
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,419
with a sense of honor and respect

447
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:18,830
we changed her head and

448
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,480
taught her to  do it

449
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,429
instinctively even on the street even

450
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:24,919
with a smartphone you immediately know

451
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,419
that if there is no contact with someone you

452
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:29,630
have to check it and know how to do it we have

453
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,340
had many other successful cases of

454
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,350
this type in which some guys have

455
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,799
also defended their companions or have

456
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,450
seen problems in their  companions and

457
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,639
therefore they intervened to save or

458
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:42,889
to avoid problems for their friends their

459
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,769
companions it does not work only for cyber

460
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:46,880
bullying it does not work only for

461
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,769
solicitation it also works for

462
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:50,330
adults in fact from this year we also open

463
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,130
courses for adults for scams on

464
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,110
line that there are a lot of people who

465
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,960
then get fooled worse than the

466
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,519
kids so just add up this is

467
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,019
what  we do is a little different from

468
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:04,490
what we usually talk about

469
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,710
now I realize

470
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,640
we deal more with

471
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,010
aggression between people instead

472
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,010
of between

473
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,840
computers our aim is to train digital warriors

474
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,700


475
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,100
we have exceeded eighteen minutes no

476
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,409
because there was  a minute of pillow yes never

477
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,750
but if there are questions I pass this

478
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,980
microphone that I do not think is working

479
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:44,390
yes yes yes questions not all together but

480
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:52,020
okay I wanted to do too much maybe

481
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,690
collapsed together calmly to be able to

482
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,049
join heinz in showcases then be

483
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:04,440
involved in it and possibly  to open

484
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,600
the fraud maybe they are things that good or

485
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,390
bad for mou also we already know we

486
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,559
have already talked about it but maybe it could be of

487
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,790
interest to someone

488
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,380
so I ask the question to be able to

489
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,990
open your own design sheen tech what

490
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,660
is there to do then we are training people

491
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,010
in  all of Italy because they call us a little

492
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,470
everywhere to open a dojo you have to

493
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,530
follow a training that is purely

494
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,490
let's say most onl  and

495
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,410
after that there are physical encounters

496
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,940
in which, however, we have to see why

497
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,590
you are not crazy and that if

498
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,360
you test you know how to be together with kids to

499
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,700
explain things to them it is obvious that those with a

500
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,559
background and martial art are perhaps

501
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,030
easier in the sense that one who  there is already the

502
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,350
right head I explain to him the technical things

503
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,120
one who has a lot of technical stuff but does not have

504
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,679
the right head you have to explain to him

505
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,490


506
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,080
the basic concepts

507
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,600
for a longer time to transform him into a martial arts master

508
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,809
but yes we do  done with

509
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:53,250
pavia we can do it as we are

510
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,200
doing with many other people so it is

511
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,330
a training there is an annual fee of

512
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,340
20 euros that all the practitioners of

513
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,770
zanchin tech in italy pay to be

514
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,919
enrolled in the national register

515
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,169
after which it is simply to follow the

516
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:09,480
training  and to open a dojo you need to

517
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,960
be at least two because the fourth

518
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,370
rule that you do not see now of the

519
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,350
dojo says at least two master students

520
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,350
present, otherwise there is no lesson

521
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,900
p  because those kids are never left alone

522
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,260
and therefore there is a minimum number

523
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,850
of people for all yours for

524
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,789
all theirs otherwise you can sign up as

525
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,679
simple practitioners but if you don't go to

526
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:33,110
a dojo you don't go ahead or you  can

527
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,429
support in the sense that there is a

528
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:35,090
donation

529
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,160
we even have one in the box

530
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,390
we even have a

531
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,789
special bracelet that is not in the list which is for

532
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:42,860
those who donate at least 10 euros such as

533
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,660
crowdfounding we have made

534
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,140
the supporter's bracelet

535
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,720
but if one  maybe the best thing wants to participate in

536
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,900
the online training

537
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,250
or the workshops of tomorrow and the

538
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:55,820
day after tomorrow

539
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,440
anyway if you want to peek yes tomorrow the

540
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,940
day after tomorrow we make you do what

541
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,289
we did when we created

542
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,080
the tsar sheen tech so we don't tell you

543
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,150
the techniques we found we

544
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,890
tell you  a case of priming and we

545
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,390
put you in front of a tool that

546
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,220
allows you to disassemble it and you tell us what

547
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,960
technique you have found after which we

548
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,850
discuss it  knows what at a time later

549
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,010
with cyberbullying because it also includes

550
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,120
some techniques of

551
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,799
soliciting cyberbullying inside there is everything

552
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,380
I don't know I don't know I don't know the hours

553
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,070
of tomorrow's workers

554
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,100
thanks
