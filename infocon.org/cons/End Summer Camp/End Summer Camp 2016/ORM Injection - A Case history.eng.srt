1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,339
let's talk about armin jackson which is a

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,629


3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:09,599
particularly interesting type of injection it is rather

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,210
rare compared to the older brother which

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,330
is single injection and let's see

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,490
then what an injection is what orma

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,020
what is therefore the union of these two

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,109
terms then  arm injection and in

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,609
our specific case when we

10
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,220
found it during a penetration test

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,619
what is arm injection in particular with

12
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,869
hibernate so we are talking about java where

13
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,668
under there was a never sequel

14
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,980
so the new concept works

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,200
mainly when we have the  '

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,829
let's say astronomical interlocking of these 3

17
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,950
let's say concepts and technologies

18
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,989
can now be done jackson everywhere obviously

19
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,170
the type of attack varies according to the type

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,660
of technology we have both at the

21
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,930
level and at the database level Incheon

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,010
vulnerability is very well known and

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,410
obviously dynamo la  first classified

24
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,790
of the top ten 2013 the injections occur

25
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,460
mainly when we have

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,590
data sent through a parser which

27
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,220
are then and  worked by an interpreter and

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,400
this interpreter we can try and

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,900
when we succeed we have an

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,630
injection in relation to the fact of

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,490
going to change what the

32
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,320
semantics and therefore the sense of the

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,780
request we make with that parser

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,900
therefore of the jacksons in the very famous

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,229
safe injection stranotes any

36
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,530
what but in reality we have many types of

37
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,360
injection we can do inception so

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,970
also on dap also on expat even on

39
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,280
a sequel but even if it may seem a

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,210
bit an oxymoron injection of commands

41
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,570
on the operating system injection on xml

42
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,640
smtp etcetera etcetera etcetera

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,250
for example it is possible  do injection

44
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,899
also on the database and sparkle

45
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,520
therefore to understand semantics that now

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,509
grandfather

47
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,070
we say in fashion fortunately for the

48
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,420
sharing of open data

49
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,299
and also we say on what are the

50
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,310
objects obviously follows a

51
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,519
variability that is often easy to

52
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:14,290
exploit especially when we have

53
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,379
a tool  ready to do

54
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:21,129
this lies enough of  ciamo is quite

55
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,680
common in reality even if it is ten

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,110
years that the injections also exist

57
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,890
in the top ten in the average you can

58
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,890
find it depends how difficult it is

59
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,319
how the application refers the

60
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,959
errors or not and in any case the impact

61
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,239
extremely severe because usually  it is

62
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,799
still possible to have access to a

63
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,200
database or to secure commands on the

64
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,299
operating system so it is particularly serious

65
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,209
as it usually prevents a

66
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,250
division between what is the logic

67
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,840
of the request we make to the data

68
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,440
entered

69
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,049
this thing is not always possible

70
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:01,239
so  we use parameters we say the escape

71
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,269
of parameters or in any case a positive white list

72
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:06,280
of characters that can be

73
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,510
inserted so we now have the

74
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,519
second definition that tells us

75
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:14,680
what the footprints are so

76
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,430
the object relations in the morning if everything

77
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,150
given is short enough we can  even

78
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,160
quite a few who recommend norma

79
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:36,610
boasts 200 per hour of programming

80
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,650
mainly born for simplicity  care

81
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,060
thus extended at the level of data

82
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,890
presentation layer and therefore all

83
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,460
the requests part of the application and

84
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,980
sends to interface with a database

85
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,990
the database therefore makes sense the databases

86
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,470
you use as it happens in

87
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,990
enterprise environments to store

88
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,180
data for a long time less than average  term

89
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,209
examples of this these technologies are

90
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,610
present the many languages on

91
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,829
all hibernate the framework used

92
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,850
java pro for today vhp haber net

93
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,169
who instead used me in

94
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:27,520
tottenham environments a bit of history pride

95
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,310
javier net in the java world since we

96
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,900
have chosen apart that  as

97
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,000
simone said this activity was born as a

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,270
consequence of the choices

99
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,410
in the specific case we are testing

100
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,950
an application as a stack

101
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,050
based almost entirely on java let's see a

102
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,979
bit of history this next the only thing

103
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:52,350
that may interest is that the version

104
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,860
from the version  3 in 2005 and the whole

105
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,050
a garnett system was born as one

106
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,910
was acquired by jobs and therefore  giving

107
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,970
data therefore this has contributed more and

108
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,729
more to a depressed environment a

109
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:12,400
very interesting thing that hibernates and

110
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,510
that we also see in the following slides

111
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,640
first of all are the interfacing with

112
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,190
the state then all the various requests

113
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,490
that are made database second part

114
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,490
is the case of qing now  this part is

115
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,050
very important because we have

116
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,479
entered from here in the sense of a very

117
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,380
delicate part because it allows the

118
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,729
developers who use this

119
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:38,129
framework to

120
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,249
interact almost bypassing we could

121
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:45,209
say bernet and therefore create that camp

122
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:48,050
stone cold that often and

123
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,239
willingly you too  very

124
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:54,479
likely so let's go and define

125
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,419
hibernate is a framework used to

126
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,300
simplify here there is a nice 95 100

127
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,099
life for 95 and centrality of

128
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:04,409
developers by eliminating practically

129
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:06,719
all that part of management that they

130
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:11,939
had already done from the jdbc layer,

131
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:16,769
however, it is in the orange rectangles  as

132
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:19,169
we say before in the previous seat of the

133
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,939
chaste backin  g here we see that haber

134
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:22,589
netta does not hide the desigual power

135
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:25,679
this because hibernate hard

136
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:29,009
works on the basis of figurations like

137
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:30,990
almost all frameworks especially

138
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:36,569
those that are now in fashion gave the

139
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:40,649
various springs with various rags and nothing

140
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:43,529
here we can see that a good part a

141
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,419
good part  of the power is left to

142
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,909
the developers and if this is good

143
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:50,399
only the posters will say it and this is

144
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,439
done through the clubs that makes for

145
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,809
hibernate for iran gray which as from the

146
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:56,399
previous a language very similar to the

147
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,449
sequel used precisely to

148
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:04,019
interface with the database then  a

149
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:07,679
bit of syntax so wild you see

150
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:11,279
quite poor the wars the common ones that

151
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,079
can be made by the diet of the

152
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,240
arts and so on a bit of

153
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,490
aggregate functions also some

154
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,490
expressive power but one thing interesting

155
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,129
polymorphism but as the thing that emerges

156
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:25,649
from here  if it is enough that one reads one of the

157
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:29,039
manuals of the various the various dbms is very

158
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,139
little very poor we can say

159
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,379
between  nquillamente in question of syntax

160
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:37,019
is another very interesting thing sony

161
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,050
dated ips is really the syntax

162
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,329
of the language structure

163
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,649
the interaction thing all

164
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:46,409
skating this because simone will

165
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:49,349
explain it to us after the scaling of single

166
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:49,670
acts

167
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,240
is done is done by the layer

168
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,670
orma by inserting one another for example

169
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,740
we see a small example our singh

170
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,060
a jeff jones genitive saxon use

171
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,160
english comes as we see here

172
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,140
a voice actress is passed while the

173
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,940
normal query that comes in series from the user

174
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,670
is the query that is commented in

175
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,520
java we do not see  the difference that here

176
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,380
there are from the pc of course from the other

177
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,380
nobody I pass the word simone who will

178
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,350
detail us now that we have small and

179
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,300
data how the senses works how can you

180
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,330
try to do that funny stuff

181
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,370
yes ok but obviously to that of our

182
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,350
purpose too  to go back find

183
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,289
all round what database we

184
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,750
have below use a different way of

185
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,330
do skate for example we

186
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,590
have a specific case that we now

187
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,540
present but there are techniques

188
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,160
presented only let's say in the

189
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,560
public by some Russians that according to the

190
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,140
type of we always say through the bernets

191
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,120
above according to that database different

192
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,040
techniques to be able to break this

193
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,830
concept  escape

194
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,940
let's see then what we say

195
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,410
jackson alarms has in any case been

196
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,210
classified by the cup so our

197
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,240
definition is precisely the thing of being able to

198
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,190
execute commands regardless of

199
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,630
what is the query hq l obviously we say

200
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,550
the attack as for all the injection

201
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,920
more  or less easy to exploit according

202
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,830
to what we can actually

203
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,680
see also in the error code of

204
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,390
course it is a prerequisite that

205
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,190
the application use the standard but

206
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,740
in any case there are more or less net walls

207
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,330
and you want it was donated there is also for example

208
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,220
django for python  which has the same

209
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,520
question as let's say it allows you to make

210
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,390
a footprint on python too and so there

211
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,770
are  the predictions that I have to use orma

212
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,570
so we have to see we do account

213
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,550
in the errors hibernated is used if

214
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,710
we have visible from the syntax or in

215
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,300
any case if we can understand that

216
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,139
there is one of these frameworks

217
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,239
obviously we must have a page that

218
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:53,249
receives parameters from the user therefore in the

219
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:55,319
ghetto  set cook in any way

220
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:57,420
the application decided to receive the data

221
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,939
from us and therefore that we say there is a

222
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:02,339
problem then typically inserted

223
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,139
by the developer that is in that 5

224
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:06,059
percent of code that he said donated that in

225
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,769
any case they write still be able to

226
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:09,929
insert errors then  when there

227
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:11,759
is not a correct division between

228
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,439
what the application logic is

229
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:14,730
, it is also one of which is that they are

230
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,290
made and those that are instead the data

231
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,160
that are passed so we say the

232
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,769
concept what is that if although

233
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:25,709
we say we always say ceo  typical assertion that

234
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,199
I use the hicks framework so I'm

235
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:30,059
sure this is not true because there is

236
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:32,369
a 5 percent following it  mm less than

237
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:35,009
one hundred percent that there are errors of

238
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,970
this type in the code obviously what

239
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,809
is our game

240
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:44,790
we mainly do the

241
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,529
question of the user who goes here what is

242
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,899
from the input presentation in business

243
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,189
logic data access the various

244
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:54,629
hibernated libraries  that often works

245
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:57,480
through the law the one at the head elle to

246
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,279
put it more in Italian and then yes the

247
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,519
one with a gdp is a database

248
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,110
what is the problem that even when

249
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,089
we managed to do an injection on the

250
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:07,919
warm up I saw that it is more than pulling

251
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,110
out we count a classic horror

252
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,720
one wants one the whole list of

253
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,759
contents of in that object that

254
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,350
much can not do

255
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,730
the approach was to read the

256
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,769
manual see how it works

257
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:21,059
obviously this did not give us enough

258
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,220
taste and fun we continued

259
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,649
to dig  and then we saw how the

260
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:28,139
ca that was obviously converted at the level

261
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:30,809
of framework and in the

262
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:32,699
sequel code and we went to try to

263
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:35,899
break that

264
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,880
quin  of this we want to see it also

265
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,490
together making a very brief memory

266
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,640
in our case let's say we have hq l which

267
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,649
is above sequel

268
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,270
the important thing is that hibernate file

269
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,310
escape of the single to vice so

270
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,140
we typically speak injection sustring

271
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,860
in this case with the double superscript

272
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,760
relational database

273
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,670
in our  case it was a month well

274
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,279
instead the apex escaped with slash apc

275
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,529
back tattered that therefore this thing

276
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:11,070
obviously makes us all very let's say

277
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,750
relatively simple once

278
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,820
we understand everything how it works

279
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,770
because we can try let's say to

280
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,200
send a string made that

281
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,290
typically contains superscript superscript and other

282
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,480
characters to try to make it clear from

283
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,000
which one so that the query does not grow

284
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,310
and therefore is performed described

285
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,440
on but the sequels which however is executed

286
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,399
what we actually want

287
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,450
the other document that exists that very

288
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,279
interesting had to  see of two

289
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,850
Russians who have practically

290
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,270
generalized

291
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,779
always talking about hib  ernate 4 techniques

292
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:48,480
that are precisely those to do this

293
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,470
type of injection we have precisely the

294
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,560
specific slash for never sequel for

295
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,600
post a function is used precisely

296
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,420
such as you here of tweaks ml always with

297
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,529
sequel oracle

298
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:04,010
here also a function that is based on the

299
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,860
xml a  microsoft the server e is

300
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,990
a bit more complicated for which there is a

301
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,540
nice proxy verse web map for

302
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,089
example to do this type of

303
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:16,950
work as

304
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,829
a tenco ding change with utf8 must be recently made to be

305
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:22,560
able to force the

306
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,720
string delimiter then give it  a query h which

307
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,060
digestible and executable is a never

308
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,130
sequel query which instead in this case on a

309
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,770
sequel server that he likes this

310
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,480
in short, very interesting to go and

311
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,750
see how I study from this point of

312
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,899
view

313
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,380
by doing a bit of an example and with the

314
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,170
ingredients while he told us  simone

315
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,880
we can see a moment in the previous slide in the

316
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,710
previous slide this

317
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,800
this part here the last

318
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,440
very important sentence  this is because from here it is

319
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
the tool to break a syntax

320
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,610
without breaking the other also what

321
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,320
we need to carry out a

322
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,070
real injection

323
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,720
this because in the end the

324
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,110
database but queries must arrive and or

325
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,000
that can contain whether or not commands

326
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,100
depending on the  bif it is underneath it

327
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,540
anyway I have to be sane to be

328
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,610
understandable the syntax above all to

329
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,700
be correct going back to our

330
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,960
example and imagining that a user

331
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,640
looking for maybe the same idiot time

332
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,140
I want to search for himself in a database

333
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,180
with hibernate below and with hands of that

334
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,830
below  this here an example of months

335
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,000
someone

336
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,950
and what happens then the pond from

337
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,810
the gutter this simple thing that has

338
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,980
http the parameter is taken print

339
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,020
people java we imagine this point

340
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,030
that para meter and this is passed

341
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,250
by the layer by the layer is bernet that

342
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,440
for a  towards or for another, perhaps in

343
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,900
this case we want to pass in a nice

344
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,640
generates to those h those that are

345
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,410
translated  in turn in a wedge then

346
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,100
remains sequel the whole heart is in

347
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,390
this if in this slide

348
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,460
mainly as I said before and

349
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,900
as Simone also said the goal is to

350
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,610
break one syntax without breaking

351
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,070
the other let's see how it can be done  and of

352
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,630
course all this must be

353
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,720
non sa non sanitizer in the sense that

354
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,790


355
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,800
the controls must not be present or not but that can happen

356
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,070
here by inserting a flash yacht to pc to

357
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,130
pc and a query in this case version

358
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,560
this to see if actually one

359
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,570
it was a database but sequel two it was

360
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,950
understandable or not what we were

361
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,870
writing that happens this part here

362
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,820
so the first slasher receives it was

363
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,290
considered as a normal

364
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,970
string in in check in is more beautiful

365
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,310
this because

366
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,430
the slash the back stage is a normal

367
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:59,180
character but the  single apex was

368
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,940
passed common scape to the month

369
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,680
web layer the massive layer to the sort that

370
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,420
made it took beige the first the

371
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,610
first single apex took it  a as

372
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,620
perhaps an escape and then closed the

373
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,130
query with with with the second superscript in

374
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,110
this case everything that was passed

375
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,240
came behind the meeting this an

376
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,860
example proper adjective of what

377
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,529
happens side gap side and query side and crm

378
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,830
sequel so now and there

379
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,070
then shows the same thing that we did

380
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,900
during the test is very interesting

381
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,560
because it helped us a lot the fact

382
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,830
that mainly the

383
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,980
error management was not let's say it was present

384
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,570
so what happened to

385
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,150
us seeing from the simple

386
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:54,260
500 error messages  it came a bit we were

387
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,120
guided in the head obviously we

388
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,650
also had the stack thrace so there was

389
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,210
curls there was even too much data to

390
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,850
process this is good to know

391
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,920
when you are blind instead we have

392
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,209
control over errors we do not see them

393
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:07,160
because maybe what it may seem

394
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,429
a not a siculi injection even a blind

395
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,109
not working maybe it is a cappella

396
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,939
injection or in any case an arm injection

397
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:16,220
that works for these  we find our

398
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,470
ingredients then hibernate the use

399
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,500
of hq l as a query never sequel under

400
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,750
obviously an application does not care

401
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,439
written not not very well but then we return

402
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,929
to our let's say

403
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:32,179
star wars planets manager where we

404
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,240
obviously have the search for the copa then

405
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,450
a  simple very useful also to make

406
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:38,870
prof

407
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,140
let's say of injection look for our

408
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,660
main system then I will make a query

409
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,060
and the sense bag where we see precisely

410
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,370
that the results because it was so

411
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,479
database pensions are

412
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,270
therefore in this case we have for the

413
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,770
results and the speech we say

414
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,570
everything  with need is a nice

415
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,110
apex

416
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,310
this is what the beatles also think about

417
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,300
a rehabilitation and then

418
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,640
let's go to put an apex in our

419
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,750
case said it was a fortuitous case in

420
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,550
which we actually saw that

421
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,020
putting a superscript makes a mistake

422
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,030
but they were not the  typical errors of a

423
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,610
safe injection told the bernetta whose

424
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,170
exception unexpected char the with the

425
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,760
percent  so it means that we are inside

426
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,970
a like which is supported by the bernake and

427
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,010
obviously gives us all the various lava

428
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,350
lava and apart of course this how at the

429
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,110
level those points is very similar

430
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,700
pitiful relational database language

431
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,850
however actually we see that there is

432
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,320
something wrong

433
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
and  this ne special can say that we have

434
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,160
broken something can not see in

435
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,770
something in itself I have

436
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,690
never found anything before this activity

437
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,610
but we have seen these three

438
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,170
very nice letters because at the beginning we

439
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,330
thought that this first one is with us

440
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,010
the ability of masi which instead will be one

441
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,260
is the one that still did not come back

442
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,390
to us going to document what happens from

443
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,950
this citadel is the

444
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,380
language of alber netta even if we

445
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,000
maybe probably like the

446
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,140
developers who wrote this

447
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,120
application we make a

448
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,640
framework but it is  difficult to pass it

449
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,290
and instead not studying a little this

450
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,820
language with all the things we have

451
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,090
said before yes  could do something

452
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,160
we also tell you because we obviously live

453
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,870
as from tbc prof

454
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,660
let's say from sequel injection in the doubt

455
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,730
of putting a cross instead

456
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,350
let's see what happens

457
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,000
and in fact in this case the response of

458
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,150
club 200 ok and actually results

459
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,610
as for the normal par we said

460
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,890
well  here there is something interesting

461
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,860
official it should be exploited what it was

462
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,290
then start looking and typical

463
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,970
let's say a little risky so

464
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,590
we first tried with induno equal

465
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,580
1 and then

466
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,169
one wants zero to have a

467
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:58,210
peek we did said oh well

468
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,210
they gave us a lot  the permission we launch

469
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,580
and let's make one the same one is in fact among

470
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,080
the various planets let's say we

471
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,779
also found alderaan

472
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,220
it was destroyed obviously it was no longer in the list of

473
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,649
planets this thing made us say we

474
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:13,299
go further the application

475
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,100
in short there is really here c '  it is also

476
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,870
blinking guala 1 so their 1 that

477
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,700
one was a little more 6 ago than a

478
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,640
normal normal attack you say  I love that on the

479
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,380
back months because it is

480
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,360
from the layout of anyway let's say

481
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,070
in general with making a runo which one

482
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,130
in production is never a safe thing

483
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,809
usually so in case I always have to

484
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:34,570
warn when doing this type of

485
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,679
activity

486
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,260
until then after several tests  you have

487
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,419
reading the documentation and doing a

488
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:42,429
bit of phising actually we

489
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:46,269
saw that going to insert those

490
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:47,860
let's say three magic characters where

491
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,779
we talked before the bill there is

492
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:52,480
always 500 but the authors change 500

493
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,950
and this time we have a sequel grand

494
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,389
rex action

495
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:57,250
so we say to  logical level I said

496
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,830
ok lacquer that was right it has passed if

497
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,510
they do not return the error of before

498
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,159
but in this act he is angry but they

499
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:06,330
would be the piece below so the part

500
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,309
this let's say was an aspect that

501
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,649
pushed us to go beyond the hour  mind

502
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:15,220
ahead and washing and let's say yes let's say he

503
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,159
will be quite rich so to elect him

504
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,980
was very tiring in reality, however,

505
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,230
already scrolling in the error yes  he sees

506
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,299
precisely little one who says this time

507
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:27,460
the ex action on the never sequel jihadi bisi and

508
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,769
therefore we have placed a level below

509
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:32,919
with the typical error I havana errors

510
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:35,230
your sequel syntax there is some hand to the bull

511
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,720
york server version six syntax toews

512
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,690
near etc.  this which statistically

513
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,549
speaking that is precisely a safe

514
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:44,110
injection

515
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,490
obviously after we began to

516
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,130
look for how to exploit it

517
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,750
as there is not very rich

518
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,600
documentation the epic penetration tests

519
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,920
are

520
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,680
fix the time so we were there

521
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,380
so it turns you around waiting for the

522
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,510
upload too  of our data

523
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,190
we tell our heads to go

524
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,010
on several hours later

525
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,350
what we have found that obviously

526
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,930
this who can recognize

527
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,850
this string quite well who can have

528
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,500
generated it in fact we are going to see

529
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,480
however that it was actually

530
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,900
possible to make a safe injection

531
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,370
so this we typically say a

532
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,280
typical a  all of sequel maps because

533
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,040
we say having just not much  imo

534
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,890
time let's try to

535
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,910
exploit automatically in

536
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,920
any case to give a proof of concept of

537
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,280
what was possible and then

538
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,990
let's say obviously the problem was ok by

539
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,900
hand we have too little time but

540
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,580
automatically safe map according

541
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,870
to typically feeds it in a parameter one

542
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,820
page like this even taking the log of

543
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,620
our favorite tool what you

544
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,540
know I miss and says yes first maybe

545
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,370
vulnerable then some point it says no I

546
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,830
can't do anything since the

547
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,640
tools are a useful thing anyway but we

548
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,290
must not rely on them as

549
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,850
we must always go further

550
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,110
what our instrument does we

551
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,050
started to work and a bit to look for

552
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,180
and then later to find the way

553
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,410
to be able to exploit it

554
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,070
automatically

555
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,920
this so let's say they bring a life that is

556
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,440
perhaps quite rare at least for what

557
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,080
you usually see and maybe

558
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,850
only exploitable manually  with the

559
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,680
ease of exploiting of an

560
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,300
automatic tool obviously duly

561
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,780
configured so let's say this

562
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,630
precisely the original screen of the crazy sequel

563
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,820


564
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,630
let's say the interesting part years of

565
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,360
the duly anonymized part it was

566
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,620
practically the prefix using

567
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,230
a parameter in the prefix that gave the

568
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,840
answers even if they were answers let's say

569
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,580
different than one were many therefore a

570
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,190
valid page with slash  to pescia vice

571
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,390
this sequel map firmness to insert itself

572
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,590
exactly in the point where the injection figure will do,

573
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,750
thus giving him the

574
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,320
possibility to insert directly

575
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,440
into the part of those sequels already with

576
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,350
the escape part done and therefore he

577
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,740
found this sector and with the

578
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,600
ease and the  the convenience of a tool

579
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,790
such as map allowed us to

580
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,880
exploit it in a short time so as to

581
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,940
also show a screenshot of the database

582
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:32,190
in the report that underlines it from

583
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,230
the principal because

584
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,180
at the beginning google map ran without this parameter,

585
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,060
however that it happened and recognized some

586
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,220
recognize errors but the error was 10

587
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,070
that then  i maybe these configure by

588
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,050
modifying the script but I have not

589
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,550
written it in python of centuries the map

590
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,680
could be done however the time available to us is

591
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,760
very short so I load

592
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,780
tight times the advice I can

593
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,060
give to put the secondary 3d beyond

594
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,350
the dbms home

595
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,780
if c  'it is a doubt that there is a thing java

596
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,150
that runs with hibernate maybe a

597
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,370
safe name or not in addition maybe to make

598
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,160
someone run it let's say usually

599
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,020
do a check with is formed on the

600
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,120
pages more or less questionable as an

601
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,310
approach do a test

602
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,560
if there is a java and if we think that there are

603
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,280
databases of this the prefix here can

604
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,620
give us a hand maybe to find

605
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,670
something particularly useful then we go

606
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:30,630
direct conclusions what we say

607
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,580
we have learned that first of all the impact

608
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,350
of the vulnerability depends a lot on the

609
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,630
database that  there is below

610
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,670
because then obviously to do a little if

611
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,250
exploiting done well

612
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,450
then maybe go and get the

613
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,250
machine if not however recently the

614
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,920
database the possibilities that  and it offers us the

615
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,410
injection norm they depend a lot on david

616
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,290
who is

617
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,630
obviously under this also because according to

618
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,370
tve and from bill campbell exploiting that

619
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,870
we are going to use so the question

620
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,110
complicates we always say further the

621
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,930
link to this let's say paper of these

622
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,580
Russian gentlemen who had fun  to

623
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,540
do this thing obviously what

624
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,310
taught the developers that

625
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:18,800
mitigation is such to do the

626
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,110
checks as soon as possible so maybe

627
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,480
not and not trust above all the

628
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,170
frameworks thinking that the sooner we block

629
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,210
an attack the better

630
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,810
the part of the future gm injection stands for

631
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:36,500
object mapper  and hibernate

632
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,410
the part of the footprint is not enough for him, he also decided

633
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,690
to devote himself to the non-sequel world and

634
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,700
this is quite a world no so it

635
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,410
would be interesting maybe we

636
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,770
discuss it passionately and it would be

637
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,410
interesting to understand what happens in

638
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:55,670
particular to the bernets ogm is the knowledge of

639
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,440
gmo that we think we are  for today ad

640
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,440
clip grid mapper and the interesting part is

641
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,330
asking interface co  n non-

642
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,550
sequel database of type giamenti typographies but

643
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,980
I think they are freak but

644
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,330
leaving a little bit to extend

645
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,910
this other types of sequel database

646
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:15,620
then open the doors and verona 9 r in

647
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,380
this case government arises injection

648
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,360
so let's say the main concept

649
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,820
that if the known concept  motto of

650
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,410
the world prizes lipu liion never trust

651
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,980
the user input framework you because

652
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,870
by going to see precisely on wikipedia

653
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,780
under the entry dc that map

654
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,560
we find that a

655
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,360
code level enforcement say no but if you want

656
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,340
problems you are afraid of sequel injection

657
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,070
use a rule that  instead, actually

658
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,690
you can actually find

659
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,000
problems there also to cultivate

660
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,860
mind at milan enterprise for what

661
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,320
was certainly the experience we

662
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,270
really use many many

663
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,460
frameworks and they all assume that I use

664
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,230
this flower marco I'm sure

665
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,140
obviously it is not always said that

666
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,450
so be it so thank you so much for all

667
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,840
this
