1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
first of all a thank you to you

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,389
for being present to the organizers of the

3
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:05,100
east for inviting me let's

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,950
start my talk immediately as

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,440
you can see everyone's face is called

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,969
but sometimes a joke is exaggerated

7
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,500
that as you know of a

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,029
totò film of many years  ago then because

9
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,880
sometimes we exaggerate because today we

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,250
are exaggerating with face recognition in

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,490
so many senses that we will now see

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,099
first facial recognition

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,500
the worst problem I have

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,149
ever seen in my whole life not very

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,050
short unfortunately then what is

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,360
commonly thought when  an intends

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,129
recognition and feels

18
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,340
facial recognition thinks that someone puts his

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,230
face in front of the camera or maybe it

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,700
is secretly filmed with a

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,610
cellphone and some magic makes

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,690
george clooney come out, born in lexington

23
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,660
of the pa, who starts in short 61 of the

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,359
youngest of me

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,460
this here is one of the problems and it is not

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,188
what is normally called

27
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:07,290
acknowledgment ok then  we go back there is

28
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,810
not only that there is also another

29
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,750
problem which is that of a certain mister

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,630
that dude who says he is george

31
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,340
clooney who shows up in front of the

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,670
cameras says ryan jones clooney and

33
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,770
someone has to say if it is george clooney

34
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,140
with or based on some information that

35
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
already knows this properly is

36
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,329
verification then identity verification

37
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,790
the classic problem of biometrics you

38
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,549
put your finger on the

39
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,380
fingerprint machines and they tell you if you are

40
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,259
really who you say you are but you stop

41
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,320
in the recognition  you say nothing you

42
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,880
are someone who passes by on the street and someone

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,380
wants to know who you are the googleplex problem so

44
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,049
to speak then there is

45
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,299
also clustering the cluster and it totally doesn't care

46
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,560
who you

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,360
are there are a pack of photographs

48
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,310
contain a lot of faces

49
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,869
so there is no database as you see

50
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,719
a lot of faces but you want to divide

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,270
the faces of george clooney from that of

52
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,649
john travolta from those of pippo

53
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,780
tripoli all al  tri that could

54
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,970
be present in those photographs

55
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,250
this is the operation that is done nor

56
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:11,819
the time

57
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,489
so picasa and many other

58
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:16,590
facebook photographs are the ones that make the

59
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,019
king but basically they trust

60
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:20,939
what you say if you say

61
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,769
this is the photograph of the  'area my aunt

62
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:24,719
clotilde and in which all these

63
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,790
photos cerri a zia

64
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,609
clotilde he tells you this but not if he has

65
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:31,920
not checked against some said

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,250
strong bass type registry to say this is

67
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,700
the real mind the person this is the

68
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,249
basic problem then  recognition

69
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:43,349
I take a photo and I want to know who and

70
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,980
that is to attach a tag with the photo

71
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,659
verification someone says he is I

72
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:50,280
use his face to verify he is telling

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,250
the truth and clustering a pack of

74
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,049
photos brings together all those

75
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,540
who are vaguely related to one

76
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,340
of the  'other

77
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,169
then how do you do this first of all

78
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:03,000
there is a

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
practically standardized processing chain

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,919
first the tech show n  There isn't a

81
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,129
photograph I have to find out where the face

82
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:12,449
is not a trivial problem but

83
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:14,250
this is solved the easy problem

84
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,510
despite the fact that there is a mountain of

85
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,849
articles c how to do the detection almost

86
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,889
all detectors not only commercial

87
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:21,959
but also open source as offensive

88
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,389
they do very well they find the face that is

89
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:27,479
if there is a face they find the face

90
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,739
after which the face is cropped

91
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,720
inside the photograph so if you

92
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,609
arrive a few pixels earlier now you

93
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:35,519
have less and you have gone on

94
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,250
you have to make a list of what

95
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,319
it means  that you have to attribute

96
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,199
some measure to the face okay

97
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,290
i show you on the scale they say i

98
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,509
put myself there and marian attributed a weight

99
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:51,239
then a variable or they measure

100
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,069
weight and height weight height and color

101
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:55,259
of the eyes forward so for the face is the

102
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:57,650
same I have to take the face  and

103
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,919
measure a series of variables in

104
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,040
such a way as to encode the face inside the

105
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,049
database because not said drink is

106
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,959
not the whole photo  whole raffia because in

107
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,759
that case they would be full

108
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,680
reference situations but only some

109
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,180
information

110
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,010
how much information

111
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,130
the best program as performance

112
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,710
today exists that google face med

113
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,030
stores to have a good

114
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,630
performance 128 bit of information for

115
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,990
each face ok this the size that

116
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,390
is stored if  you put less

117
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,970
the lower recognition capacity

118
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,430
if you put more the

119
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,050
recognition capacity is not much higher

120
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,770
so 128 is let's say a good compromise

121
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,690
between occupied space 128 non-bit cabins is

122
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,370
a good compromise between occupied space

123
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,710
and information goodness of recognition

124
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,290
or how  I told you detention is a

125
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,340
problem let's

126
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,130
call it solved the encoding no

127
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,280
magic is all there once the

128
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,310
face is encoded the problems become much less

129
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,310
because first by two-sided

130
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,140
comparison you compare 128 bits as if they were two

131
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,730
vectors so as if they were two

132
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,920
segments  in a plane and I see the one

133
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,170
that comes closest to him and he therefore one

134
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,320
once the coding is done the problem is let's say

135
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,870
largely solved but for

136
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,870
coding it is largely magic at the moment it is

137
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,660
magic

138
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,050
then why it is magic because you have to

139
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,080
take into account many characteristics

140
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,340
that are not stable in

141
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,600
traditional biometrics the first thing you

142
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,650
choose

143
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,210
I want a characteristic that

144
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,670
the most stable thing

145
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,920
we know is stable and the dna our genome

146
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,960
as far as we know is the

147
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,670
conception and we keep it until we

148
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,880
die point ok so our dna

149
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,100
will always be the same for our whole

150
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,220
life very stable ok

151
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,060


152
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,090
fingerprints fingerprints  they are stable

153
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,160
as far as we know unless

154
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,890
accidental events amputations burns

155
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,290
someone who deliberately dips their

156
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,600
finger in acid such things but

157
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,540
unless they disappear they are stable

158
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,630
fingerprint transplants are

159
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,550
more science fiction than reality goes

160
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,270
well,

161
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,740
however,

162
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,400
the imprints of the iris are honestly possible for

163
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,320
that which  we know they are stable

164
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,180
starting from a certain age therefore the

165
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,520
footprints of the disappointed in the iris are

166
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,230
unstable starting from a certain age

167
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,610
in the age of development is not so

168
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,650
stable but let's say from 20 years onwards

169
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,300
more or less they should be those but

170
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,580
not  there are works that say we are

171
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,160
sure that it is stable we say that it goes

172
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,660
very close to it everyone's face the face

173
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,300
they love is not always the same so

174
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,580
people's faces change time

175
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,200
is not a stable biometric feature

176
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,150
okay

177
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,150
it also changes heavily over time for

178
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,180
example  both due to normal aging and

179
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,610
therefore due to age differences between the

180
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,290
various photographs and it is present that you

181
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,450
cannot take two

182
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,400
perfectly isochronous photographs you can take them a

183
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,650
second year apart but you cannot

184
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,330
take them at the same time in

185
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,370
different places so at least one

186
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,040
variation is already  agree that after a

187
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,840
nanosecond I will not be aged so

188
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,010
much it is not like in science fiction movies

189
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,750


190
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,490
but it is true that the beams  and photographs from

191
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,740
when I was 16 now that in 56 I

192
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,420
am a little bit different in many

193
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,510
in but a little bit are different but

194
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,800
therefore the difference

195
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,660
affects a lot because my identity has

196
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,600
remained more or less the same but my

197
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,950
face does not unlike my DNA

198
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,140
then there are huge problems of pose

199
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,680
primacy of front profile max 8 or

200
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,180
they are all hidden because I'm

201
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,560
doing a big one I don't want to

202
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,690
show me all these beautiful things

203
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,940
these variations somehow and

204
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,970
I laughed somehow understand and then there

205
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,590
are the lighting variations

206
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,510
now it has a particular lighting

207
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,360
normally not if not

208
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,490
conditioned lighting that is not done on purpose by

209
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,440
someone who has to shoot the

210
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,210
lighting problem could

211
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,610
be sensitive and then there are other

212
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,350
damn accidents they are

213
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,480
purely accidental events such as beard and

214
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,340
glasses are  fell and got a

215
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,410
wound and a band-aid on the face in

216
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,850
all spy movies there is always one that

217
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,170
you put the patch on to not be

218
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,730
recognized because in actually a

219
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,650
problem if one has a patch it

220
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,960
completely changes the connotations and

221
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,669
nobody notices the fact that I have a patch it is

222
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,230
normal I

223
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,120
am cut by shaving for a

224
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,380
woman it is more difficult to justify

225
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,280
something than  generally however it can work no

226
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,560
then in other words the encoding that is

227
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,660
when I go to get the face and the

228
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,040
encoding in the database

229
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,130
I don't have to code a face I have to

230
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,110
code all its possible

231
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,600
variants all from the first to the last

232
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,420
ok or at least all those that have

233
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,760
some interest for me if I want to

234
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,440
identify a person today

235
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,050
probably recognize him in the

236
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,000
photographs of when he was six years old

237
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,500
I don't care much

238
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,720
if I want to tag photographs

239
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,910
instead I would like to recognize him on a wide

240
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,770
age range because probably the

241
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,110
photographs in his albums date back to an

242
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,940
earlier period  to

243
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,010
facial recognition as we know it today

244
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,680
so it's a big PR  oblema it is a big

245
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,710
problem to code in the database

246
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,470
a measure that is valid in all

247
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,240
these conditions or at least in

248
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,830
those on which they have put the cross

249
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:42,260
that we are interested in memorizing then which

250
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,300
approaches have been followed the first

251
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,310
approach is the approach of

252
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,230
bertillon berti  george you know one who lived at the

253
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,730
end of the nineteenth century who invented

254
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,220
photo-signaling photography had

255
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,710
already invented it as soon as it was invented but the

256
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,570
gendarmerie of belgium had already thought

257
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,730
of doing what today are called the

258
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,060
magi shot, that is, photography so and so

259
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,700
for fact  report people who

260
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,760
had a police history bertillon

261
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
invents this

262
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,140
photo-signaling mechanism and

263
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,690
in a short time also invents a

264
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,470
mechanism for other people to

265
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,150
recognize people who are perfect

266
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,090
strangers for those who recognize using

267
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:30,280
facial features for example shape

268
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,200
of the ear the shape of the chin  the

269
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,240
distance from a whole idea that is a bit

270
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,030
positivist and a bit Lombrosian so if

271
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,340
I measure the distances between the eyes the

272
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,170
distances between the eyes and the nose the

273
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,780
width the oval a series of

274
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,120
impressive parameters calculation ratios

275
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,580
multiply by 3 14 I get a series

276
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,980
of numbers that characterize a face

277
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,050
at that point if someone takes a

278
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,730
photograph of me  an unknown effect discount

279
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,950
and I have to go and look

280
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,740
in the database I recalculate all those numbers

281
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,870
which then I go to look for someone who

282
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,690
resembles him based on the numbers I measured

283
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,450
ok this is the classic

284
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,360
approach that is still followed in

285
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,200
any forensic procedure

286
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,840
where these measurements are made on

287
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,880
details perhaps of the ear in order to

288
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,620
then be able to go to the

289
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,260
photo-signaling databases to look for these

290
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,730
images the difficult geometric extraction

291
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,920
today is almost no longer

292
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,890
practiced because it cannot capture

293
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,630
all the age variations all the things

294
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,750
that there  I said before it is used instead

295
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:43,330
to make sentiment measures of emotions

296
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,160
for example these seem a bit  that

297
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,570
keeps this pissed off that instead more

298
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,150
smiling forward so then understanding if

299
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,030
a person is visually manifesting

300
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,770
emotions

301
00:11:53,770 --> 00:12:00,100
using these points is fine two other

302
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,810
approaches that have been followed this one

303
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,100
who had already understood that this one here

304
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,660
for a computer was not good for

305
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,250
humans  that's okay because it

306
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,040
greatly reduces the size of the problem that is there

307
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,840
are few things to take into account a

308
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,600
human being can basically do it a

309
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,660
computer can do many more things but in this way

310
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,740
it can't do it

311
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,080
it can't do it well then they

312
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,730
invented a mechanism for which

313
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,750
algorithm I don't describe to you because

314
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,880
first is widely published second is

315
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,310
mathematically

316
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,200
crazy crazy like mathematics like how

317
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,090
algorithm that basically what it does

318
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:38,660
takes faces and measures some

319
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,030
feature that you think captures

320
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,560
all that information I

321
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,280
told you before how it does

322
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,480
well  in fact it is more an

323
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,490
enteric question than it is a scientific question

324
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,380
we don't know  We appear what

325
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,300
faces are recognized exactly we do not

326
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:53,930
know we

327
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,700
know that some things are more

328
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,440
significant than others psychologists

329
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,970
say it but we don't know

330
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,310
everything so they said a computer if you

331
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,190
make yourself I give you some pictures I

332
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,800
tell you  I who are of the same person

333
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,420
and you try to understand how I did

334
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,100
understand that in the same person

335
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,800
this is a little bit the basic idea is

336
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,320
a bit the same idea that was

337
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,600
applied in a much simpler case

338
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,520
when the

339
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,160
mp3 compression compression will meditate is based on

340
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,830
this fact that what makes us recognize

341
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,010
a piece of music as that piece of

342
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,350
music without distortion

343
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,540
then I calculate the

344
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,120
fury spectrum and start throwing pieces away

345
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,950
until someone tells me no at

346
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,839
this point this thing does just

347
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:39,710
crap

348
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,320
is fine there standing still and try to understand

349
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,800
what I threw away I find that not

350
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,470
all frequencies are good for

351
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,339
the human ear

352
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,310
I find that the phase of the signal d  elle

353
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,020
harmonics is not good for the

354
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,420
human ear that does not hear it at that

355
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,620
point I throw away all that

356
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,260
information I compress the others I get

357
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,530
a signal that is

358
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,140
much lower in information content than the

359
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,440
original one but as identical psychological content

360
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,450
because human beings

361
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,140
are not  sensitive to certain things well here it is

362
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,420
the same thing evidently in the phases

363
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,610
there are things to which we are more sensitive

364
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,680
others less sensitive the main

365
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,300
component analysis we try to understand

366
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,210
what these things are like

367
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,000
showing a computer so many images and

368
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,770
telling them they are all of the same

369
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,970
person try to understand why it

370
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,060
is okay they have obtained different

371
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,819
pc based algorithms a linear discriminant

372
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:42,689
analysis is a similar thing as

373
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:44,550
different concept as algorithm they also

374
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,370
put them together i.e. pca lda in the same

375
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,290
algorithm and they got certain

376
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,160
results

377
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,790
but the best results were

378
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,160
obtained with neural networks what

379
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,930
are called neural networks q  uale on

380
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,319
several levels

381
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,689
the two algorithms that currently

382
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:06,000
perform better are

383
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,600
Facebook's face and google's Facebook both

384
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,579
published at the bottom of the slides there are

385
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,430
references to the articles that describe

386
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,779
that you won't need anything then

387
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,319
I'll explain why,

388
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,639
however, these two algorithms are the ones

389
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,709
who obtain the best

390
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:26,100
performance possible on the market today comparable to

391
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,889
that of a human being who looks at

392
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:31,920
the faces of people he does not know

393
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,199
because when humans look at

394
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,519
the faces of people they know they

395
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,649
also recognize other things such

396
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:40,110
as attitude, posture, the way of

397
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,819
walking the way of putting oneself so as to

398
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:44,399
speak so many other things that

399
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,660
from the point of view of recognition

400
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,759
are even more important than the face

401
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,160
ok even more important than the face

402
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,809
so much so that the alighiero

403
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:57,569
noschese imitators actually make

404
00:15:57,569 --> 00:15:59,309
imitations that from the point of view  of sight of the

405
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:01,709
face but they would not deceive even a

406
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:04,379
child but they know how to imitate  are posture

407
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,500
attitude the vocal attitude the

408
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,680
vocal cadence and they deceive us

409
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,759
perfectly because I do not mention we see

410
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,199
the person in front of us we

411
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,920
immediately understand who the subject they

412
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,569
are imitating is immediately but it is not

413
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,370
from the face because if you think about it

414
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,649
many do not even try to

415
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,779
disguise themselves  noschese at the time did it

416
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,209
but many of the current imitators do not

417
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:29,279
even you understand who it is they are

418
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,610
imitating ok then how

419
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,160
these algorithms work

420
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,410
basically they show the

421
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,230
algorithm all the faces that we

422
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,110
want in some way let's

423
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,939
identify so it takes a little  of

424
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:46,350
a database of images

425
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,960
there are many of the bass available

426
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,410
in the network of standard faces already

427
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,950
labeled so you know that there are 40

428
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,270
faces of dude 40 faces of caio 40 faces

429
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,820
of sempronium and on so that you can

430
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,420
see and tell these algorithms

431
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,180
this  I am and dude these sempronio

432
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,680
now I will show you dude and

433
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,660
sempronio and try to understand the

434
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,190
differences  z between the two of them

435
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,599
this is the logic of the algorithm

436
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,280
I show him both the faces of the same

437
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,770
person telling him that it is the same

438
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,650
person and the faces of different people

439
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,560
telling him that they are different people

440
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,900
those of google face net is currently

441
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,870
the best recognition algorithm in

442
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,060
existence  they had this

443
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,790
idea I show them three faces two of the

444
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,320
same person

445
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,090
one of a different person and I tell

446
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,340
them these two are of the same person

447
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,430
this is another try to understand why

448
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:50,580
this is his room then google

449
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,190
as I told you is the current winner

450
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,380
our ability to recognize on a

451
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,800
training database that lfv le

452
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,550
ball facing the wheel which is 99 63

453
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,850
percent significantly better

454
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,650
than a human's ability to

455
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,510
recognize a complete stranger which

456
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,250
is around 95 percent

457
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,120
ok on youtube facebook which does not  they are

458
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,200
images but they are filmed you can

459
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,600
get to 95 12 with our friend,

460
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,370
however, on the films, human beings are

461
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,360
a p  or better because they have

462
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,780
movement and therefore are also able to

463
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,870
grasp attitudes that are not they

464
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,470
can be grasped on the single image

465
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,170
but attention said so one says it

466
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,900
cabbage 99 64 enough we are all

467
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,410
labeled no it's not it's not really like that

468
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,360
then first to train a network

469
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,520
neural of that type you need an immense death set

470
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,700
immense thing for you

471
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,340
finished a little too much come on there is something that

472
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,190
keeps us a computer

473
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:09,110
no no no immense in numbers from sniffed

474
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,540
320 million

475
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,240
I do you ok so you have an opinion of the

476
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,160
immense who there  it has at least

477
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,730
a third of what was used

478
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,600
then the advantage is that once

479
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,630
I have trained the network I have practically

480
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,280
calculated the parameters of that network it

481
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,560
takes the parameters I can give and I can

482
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,630
use I can sell them I can

483
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,790
distribute because they are a pack of

484
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,610
numbers in agreement are like the

485
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,290
compression factors that are in the images of the

486
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,300
technologists to the periods eyes

487
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,950
these are the coefficients that okay

488
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,860
use here  esti in the filter after which

489
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,960
all you get is fine these have

490
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,530
trained a network then we will also see the

491
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,830
parameters how much they have lost us and have

492
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,960
trained these networks in order to

493
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,600
get the parameters to which we can not

494
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,560
attribute any practical meaning

495
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,520
I mean it is not the distance

496
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,230
between the eyes as it was in the case of

497
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,440
traditional biometrics is a number is one

498
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,580
of the many numbers that must be calculated to

499
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,870
be able to recognize faces even different from

500
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,640
those of the training database because

501
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,550
I remind you that when I am able

502
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,130
to recognize a face I calculate 128

503
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,980
bytes that  I am the compressed version of

504
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,590
that face after which if I give another

505
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,470
face it will calculate another 128 bytes which

506
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,960
are the signature if you want that face

507
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,150
comparing the signatures I do not

508
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,950
need to have the original database

509
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,580
compare to the signatures and I find

510
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,270
similar faces simply by comparing them or  the

511
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,010
similarity of faces with a database

512
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,930
that I already have available obviously

513
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,430
the training  It can be done at different

514
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,000
levels

515
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,090
so I can show a few faces and

516
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,760
get certain results or millions of

517
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,250
easy ones get much better results

518
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,610
okay I can also get different results

519
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,710


520
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,299
because if I want to have a network

521
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:15,250
capable of recognizing faces of the same

522
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,620
person at different ages

523
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,950
the  right to give me an age

524
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,809
if instead I want to recognize many

525
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,610
people in a particular moment of

526
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,500
their life then throw away

527
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,080
from the information on age and the right one

528
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,820
only to get information on

529
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,720
that unfortunately the training process

530
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,440
and the choices of the faces themselves is not well

531
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,809
known that is, tests have been made

532
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:43,120
but there are no published algorithms

533
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,429
so if I have to give you to you you have to

534
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,539
download

535
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,630
the PV from the network there is the database of those faces

536
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,149
however you have to choose between the right

537
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:55,120
network and the sequence in which you present them

538
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,250
is  it is also relevant so you have to

539
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,260
start from the most different ones to

540
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,390
arber if the most similar ones but this

541
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,000
presupposes  to already know that

542
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,620
different things what similar for a

543
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,029
neural network so a little to the cat

544
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:10,230
eating its tail is an extremely work

545
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:16,480
of craftsmanship not of art keep in

546
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,899
mind that face net the performance

547
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:22,960
defacement was obtained after 700 hours

548
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,110
of training using 300 million

549
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,659
of training images then

550
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:30,970
take into account how much every

551
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,789
single image has processed that is 700 700 hours of

552
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:36,399
face 300 million and you will realize

553
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:39,120
that they have not used a commodore 64

554
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,610
certainly ok this is the first

555
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,669
information we get then of the

556
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:47,919
more realistic figures we find from  an

557
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,020
implementation of open face fart at

558
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,230
carnegie mellon university that you

559
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,270
can access here on the net that uses

560
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,880
the gpu to do these calculations they

561
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,090
already provide you with four pre-

562
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:04,179
trained models that are n 4 in its various

563
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:07,000
tastes that have these performances 92

564
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,630
percent 92 for  one hundred and 91 percent and

565
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,909
76 percent of awards the

566
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:16,179
smallest where this is to be understood as

567
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:19,870
the capacity  of percentage of true

568
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,240
positives that is I give a face of a

569
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,110
person who is in the database

570
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,890
and she he really finds all these

571
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,160
numbers and even those of google have

572
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,500
been calculated at a percentage of

573
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,350
false positives of one per thousand

574
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,830
so 0.001 ok that of  a

575
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,929
fixed seal conventionally not because it is not

576
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:43,340
a magic number and researchers have

577
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,530
decided that that was fine so with

578
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,100
a percentage of false positives of 1

579
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,100
per thousand you get a percentage of

580
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,590
true positives of 92 percent

581
00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:02,330
92 92 present in that case then so

582
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,850
far  all the beautiful things the least

583
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,150
beautiful things are these first we do not know

584
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,620
exactly what the accuracy of

585
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,809
this is how much the

586
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:17,929
age variation affects the ability of a

587
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:20,360
system to recognize faces we

588
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,210
do not know how the system behaves

589
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,980
when we train it  with

590
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,470
really huge databases

591
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,570
so beware of 300 million

592
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,910
images are not 300 million faces

593
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,870
are 300 million faces of images i  n

594
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,970
which each face each tag was

595
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,580
represented at least 40 times

596
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,890
so the number of

597
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,840
identity individuals is much lower

598
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,580
ok we do not know when there was a

599
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,260
dl by chance the database like the one that

600
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,730
facebook and google potentially have

601
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,059
of a billion individuals but we know

602
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,770
how  these systems behave

603
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,150
because there are people who

604
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,040
objectively resemble each other

605
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,040
ok then the puzzle that even

606
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,330
professionally should be able to

607
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,830
recognize people was not

608
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,270
able to distinguish two of my two of

609
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,710
my daughters who look very

610
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,000
much alike ok having the lists not at the

611
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,650
same time  and this is a problem I

612
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,750
would have a problem I say about him but even

613
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,380
greater because I have a

614
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,880
genetic difficulty recognizing

615
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,220
people's faces is called prosopagnosia mine

616
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,020
in a very mild form

617
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,270
but I could meet them on the street and he was

618
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:32,870
present

619
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,480
and was one of mine wanting  and at first

620
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,280
glance I don't recognize them if I get

621
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,470
another input like but I'm

622
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,240
what po  i things get back into place

623
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,480
okay then we don't know how they

624
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,980
behave the accomplished in front of

625
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,850
this problem

626
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,830
already human beings are not all

627
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,990
good at recognizing faces some

628
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,700
are incredible top performers

629
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,280
others like me incredible dogs

630
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,010
computers  we do not know because they are

631
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,260
good within the limits of that

632
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,780
test database but if I after 300 million faces

633
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,240
of laughter 40 for the number of poses per

634
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,730
individual present one billion

635
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,550
individuals how good he is

636
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,650
we still

637
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,450
do not know above all we do not know  not even

638
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,230
how accurate the recognition is if we

639
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,940
instead of 40 images of the same

640
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,650
individual have four or even

641
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,140
only one currently the

642
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,390
photo-signaling databases contain two images

643
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,900
of a person front and side to the

644
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,080
side view and that's enough if one

645
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,690
wanted to take a database of mayotte

646
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,790
le  classic police images

647
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,010
transferring them to this database would have

648
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:44,270
one image per individual point no  n 40

649
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,970
and even if he has trained the network very

650
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,750
well we do not know how good yes

651
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,360
with how well the network behaves on

652
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,460
what is the single match problem

653
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,170
that is the problem of having a single

654
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,510
image only one sample for each

655
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,030
individual to be recognized we think that

656
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,950
it is not exceptional then there is the problem

657
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,110
of the targets the targets are those who

658
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,140
want to be photographed who cooperate

659
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,540
do not cooperate there is a person who wants to

660
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,160
be recognized by a

661
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,260
biometric system stands in front of the

662
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,570
system shows a person who wants to

663
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,160
rob  I don't think a bank

664
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,540
puts itself in front of the camera waving

665
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,620
hello with its little hand

666
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,650
ok it will not cooperate from the point of view of

667
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,080
recognition even if you do not

668
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,480
use these guys in so

669
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,520
special tricks to hide

670
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,210
your face

671
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,920
is fine then we do not know exactly

672
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,520
even if there

673
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,410
the accuracy of the image quality,

674
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,120
understood in the sense of

675
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,320
quantity of bits per pixel, is a work in

676
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,880
progress  the ability to recognize

677
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,730
one thing that we can say with almost

678
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:55,230
absolute certainty is that

679
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:01,750
cctv video surveillance systems in 99.64 percent

680
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,930
of cases are useless because from the

681
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,130
point of view of

682
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,640
facial recognition they are not able to provide

683
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,730
enough bits of information  to have

684
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,960
a face recognized

685
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,580
ok so here the first reason why it is

686
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,100
entitled someone exaggerates someone

687
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,730
exaggerates by saying that now they

688
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,800
photograph us all will recognize us and

689
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,800
touch us a da venì mustache lady and

690
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,190
that is with what video surveillance systems currently do

691
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,500


692
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,800
individual tagging to  I think an error of the bo 50

693
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,700
percent probably you do not get

694
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,560
anything from this information for many

695
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,570
reasons and basically because the

696
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,460
bitrate is too low then because

697
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,500
the frame is too small the face

698
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,150
once cropped from the image are

699
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:56,260
7x7 pixels and one says oh well  7x7 for the

700
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,570
49 pixel pixon that much is not that

701
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,590
I can distinguish then so this is it

702
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,190
a problem

703
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,680
vice versa there are in some

704
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,990
airport environments very high

705
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,510
resolution or double resolution cameras

706
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,340
once a subject has been identified they can

707
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,650
zoom harlow and obtain an image of

708
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,910
its vault at very high resolution

709
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,490
higher than that which is instead good

710
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,490
for recognition as

711
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:25,000
we know it.  currently the average

712
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,090
of the sensitive images for the purpose of

713
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,280
automatic recognition is of no use for

714
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,170
the purposes of

715
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,660
personal recognition is another matter because

716
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,360
once again if someone sees

717
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,060
a known person pass they will notice

718
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,890
the gait they will notice the step they will notice the

719
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,360
clothes they will notice a lot of things  that not

720
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,040
only does it and they somehow

721
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,380
recognize it as to making legal proof

722
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,820
these things but they are

723
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,040
investigatively speaking to an excellent

724
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,960
meaning as legal proof I do not think it

725
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,059
is worth much

726
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,029
then obviously the

727
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,649
recognition systems like all

728
00:29:59,649 --> 00:30:02,889
biometric systems can be  attacked

729
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:06,370
attacked deliberately then  so far

730
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,080
we have talked about what

731
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,669
their characteristics were

732
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:11,559
from an intrinsic point of view there is

733
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,230
what they can do both in the conditions

734
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,809
in which a co for i and in the conditions

735
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:19,690
in which one does not cooperate but here we are in the

736
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,129
case in which one is breaking  the boxes

737
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:22,990
deliberately is a different thing

738
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,749
so it is not not cooperating not

739
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:27,129
cooperating it means that I walk on the

740
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:29,649
street on my own I do nothing

741
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:32,289
to cooperate but I do nothing to

742
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:36,940
not cooperate I do my normal life

743
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,860
in other cases instead someone takes

744
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,289
it  of his ok he takes his part to

745
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:45,789
attack the system and make him do things

746
00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:49,210
other than what one intends the three

747
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,860
main attacks that we can

748
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,899
imagine are those and even someone

749
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:54,759
putting into practice are fed up poisoning

750
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:58,450
antine girlish spoofing spoofing the

751
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,740
typical attack against systems

752
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,450
biometric ie I try to simulate

753
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,580
the identity of another

754
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,679
the problem of the biometrics of

755
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,960
all biometric systems is the so-called

756
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,600
lightn  ess then you have surely seen

757
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,210
some movies where there is the

758
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,039
iris print go someone gets an

759
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,080
eye to the person who shows

760
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,330
it okay here it would not work so

761
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,379
don't go around gouging out the eyes

762
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,840
of people who hurt  it is ugly and a

763
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,509
crime and in any case it does not work because if

764
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,799
one that when making the

765
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,080
iris imprints the few systems that make the

766
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,360
iris ready first take the photo

767
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,580
of your veins then make a

768
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,889
dig of the eyes activate the

769
00:31:35,889 --> 00:31:37,899
mydriasis which is the  restriction of the

770
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:42,220
pupil and they redo the photo if the

771
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,190
pupil does not tighten or it is a photo or is

772
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,570
a dead person

773
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,860
so no they say no so it is not good

774
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,320
that there are also other

775
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,100
lightness tests in the fingerprints we

776
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,980
try to measure the temperature because

777
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,210
one  he could put a silicone mold in it

778
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,909
but in this way he cannot

779
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:06,299
heat the mold holding heavens in his hand they

780
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,050
also measure the plate

781
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:11,350
so the acid concentration of the

782
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,480
surface of the skin that has some

783
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,310
different characteristics that one uses use

784
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,290
of plastic casts rather than anything else

785
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,160
no

786
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,270
and this is already more difficult to

787
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,010
deceive because silicone does

788
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,840
strange things if even you shield us on a place

789
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,430
in its casts it is not so easy to

790
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,530
pass but not all systems

791
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,570
work  in this way, for example, a

792
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,920
fingerprint recognition

793
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,190
made with an image does not measure the ph

794
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,930
does not measure the temperature you rip it off

795
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,090
that a pleasure to clarify rip off

796
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,910
please a recognition of iris

797
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,460
or face that does not measure

798
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,320
something else you rip it off which is  a pleasure a

799
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,240
recently published article and I

800
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,590
acknowledge the vermelho puzzle reported of

801
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,800
people on genes of 2016 August just a

802
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,560
few days ago people used

803
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,200
virtual reality to present

804
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,270
a realistic face to a facial recognition system

805
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,330
then take

806
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,690
photographs that a public on facebook

807
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,330
reconstruct  a 3d image and presenting it

808
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,070
to the three-dimensional system one says

809
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,630
why a photo is not enough  ography no

810
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,280
because

811
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,610
biometric facial recognition systems those that make

812
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,470
you identity verification ask you to

813
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,320
move by type put on like this now

814
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,590
put on so close your eyes a little

815
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,810
let's see if you are alive and if you are a

816
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:31,000
three-dimensional object because it is a face it

817
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,110
is not two-dimensional

818
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,410
if I take a photo and turn it around I get

819
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,150
a different effect from turning the face

820
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,860
because the perspective projections are

821
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,880
different ok so if I have a

822
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,680
virtual reality how these

823
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,140
gentlemen have reconstructed you cheat the system

824
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,760
if you do not assist us it does not get

825
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,630
ripped off so easily anyway  about

826
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,800
biometric systems

827
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,520
I am perhaps

828
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,570
a little bit skeptical wrongly because they deceive themselves a little

829
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,850
too easily poisoning is

830
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,670
the last thing I tell you even smarter

831
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,180


832
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,430
if you want to deceive these systems

833
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,290
the few in severe training the classic

834
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:11,380
poisoning flood the network with

835
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,440
your images  in which you have done a

836
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,570
slight morphing with some famous actor or

837
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,250
actress  or taste

838
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,668
because in this case you look like the network to

839
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:24,340
that actor but of that actor there are

840
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,440
6 billion images circulating

841
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,379
so the system having to choose between

842
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:32,860
but he is a complete stranger o and george

843
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,260
clooney azra george clooney is much more

844
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:35,918
likely

845
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,429
ok so so yes  poisons the

846
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:42,159
massive recognition system such a

847
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,270
thing works

848
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,980
among other things who knows that

849
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,570
a person who perhaps someone knows has invented

850
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,530
it is called pigs the tania pigs is the

851
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,510
same one who understood and published an

852
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,730
article a few years ago  proving

853
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,390
that the only information that you have

854
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,170
available from public sources will

855
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,180
allow you to anonymize an

856
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,070
impressive amount of people I

857
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,440
wait for work on this

858
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,880
poisoning ability to say so

859
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,040
to deceive the system anti

860
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,810
recognition obviously once you know

861
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:16,030
how the system works yes  makes up

862
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,250
so deliberately fooling

863
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,080
system grows a beard takes

864
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,800
his glasses and a lot of other stuff  and

865
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,080
these are the articles because

866
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,210
I told you interesting open face because

867
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,170
software that can be downloaded

868
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,360
easily try even the networks

869
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,360
already trained so you do not pay the 700

870
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,860
hours of training but you already have the

871
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,120
trained model opencv for thoughts

872
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,880
for the free cone period detection to

873
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,950
crop the  face within the

874
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,990
images these are the two articles

875
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,520
I mention only two those of facebook

876
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,360
those of face which is defenses facebook

877
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,810
phase goals that of google where they

878
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,060
describe well what they have done

879
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,530
but obviously they are careful not to

880
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,960
publish the trained networks because the

881
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,140
trained network  it is the object that costs,

882
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,620
that is, it costs 700 euros plus

883
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,990
300 million images plus a

884
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,820
training algorithm extremely tricky

885
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,390
zoe ok while these from here you can

886
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,880
download pre-trained models that

887
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,640
have 95 percent performance which

888
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,870
are what you need  I said

889
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:29,320
last question in your opinion 99 and 64

890
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,020


891
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,200
percent what corresponds to how you solve  one

892
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,720
let me explain better the dna identifies you on

893
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,820
one part in 4 billion

894
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,990
ok 99 64 said so it seems a good

895
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:46,400
number is one in 270 from a forensic point of

896
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,270
view I would not be so calm

897
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,920
using an error of 1 in 270 and in

898
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,750
any case I think  that few courts

899
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,120
would accept

900
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,060
recognition of one party in 270 as legal proof, while

901
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,620
I happily accept the one per

902
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,610
billion of the dna ok thanks you one

903
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,870
available for your questions
