1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
and oh well I'm sorry so that soon

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,220
you will have to sip hello everyone I am

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,719
often you feel ok

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,330
I take it for granted that you hear me and I am

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,619
here to present what we do

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,630
as a working computer museum

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,369
but also as an interactive museum

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,199
of computer archeology because

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,990
we are two museums 1 in palazzolo acreide in the

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,060
province of syracuse and one cosenza that

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,830
work as if they were the only museum

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,020
because we were born together many years ago

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,180
from the very beginning we have always collaborated with each other

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,860
we have exchanged

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,050
pieces information the initiatives

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,610
we do  together for which we consider ourselves

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:48,360
a unique museum and in reality we are also

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,600
a fairly scattered network

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,879
around the world of people doing things

20
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,010
we start from tn point org we say

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,899
to our international interface

22
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,090
it becomes software it becomes a day one operating system

23
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,629


24
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:03,719
for example yes  he does ladine bolic many

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,119
things we have done in the past

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,250
funny freaknet point organs

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,979
but we are always in Italy and then  tria

28
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,750
club which was a very

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,340
small laboratory that was in the palace believes

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,930
this village and from which

31
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,450
the museum project was born which is this let's say it

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,610
was born in 97 as an idea in the sense that we have

33
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,710
started since then to collect even

34
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,880
a few years earlier in fact  to

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,409
collect historical hardware and put

36
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:28,979
it aside,

37
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,990
however, having reached a certain amount

38
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,850
of machines, the idea of exhibiting and

39
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,630
using them came out quite

40
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,950
automatically and in our small way

41
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,360
we try to do a whole series of

42
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,250
activities ranging from restoration to

43
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,659
refurbishment  function of the

44
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,729
data recovery machines now slowly we will see

45
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,750
something of this in cosenza instead they

46
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,329
come up in the same year in which we

47
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,150
put on the 2003 exhibition

48
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,070
since we were born together from the beginning

49
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,330
we tried to give us a hand

50
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,740
and everything we do in  indeed

51
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,690
we do it as a single entity, so much so

52
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,940
that now we will try to try to

53
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,380
unify even the

54
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,090
farn website  and only one we

55
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,210
record and archive it with the

56
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,500
collections as if it were a single

57
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,830
collection thing of this type because

58
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,570
we think that in short, collaboration

59
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,980
is the only thing that can make

60
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,370
people go better with things,

61
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,520
the locations work better than if we

62
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,930
have them  many people ask us but how

63
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,760
do you do you have some help no we have

64
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,770
no help because no one kata,

65
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,600
not even in passing and so

66
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,390
after years we have decided to rent

67
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,050
some seats ourselves, self-taxing us and it is the

68
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,790
way in which at the moment we survive the

69
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,860
one above and the  seat of green track

70
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,720
for rent the one below taken from google

71
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,910
map and ours and we go on so

72
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,440
we have a minimum of exposure in two

73
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,590
rooms with working computers this is

74
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,620
all stuff unfortunately for you apple where

75
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,959
we have ridden the death of steve jobs

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,300
to attract people to the

77
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,730
however, the museum is an exhibition that we have

78
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:16,750
dedicated to steve wozniak by the way and

79
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,730
we do not limit ourselves only to collecting

80
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,680
the hardware pieces but ra  we take

81
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,940
everything about these computers

82
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,410
so first of all the manuals and

83
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,330
possibly the documentation of

84
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,769
wiring diagrams everything you need

85
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,940
to keep them running to repair them

86
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,040
and then the software the software that the

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,510
main thing otherwise these

88
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,000
machines do not work then the

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,790
magnetic tapes cassettes  from everything that

90
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,830
can be the media of the past

91
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,870
8-inch floppies that are so big those

92
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,820
from five and a quarter to three and a half strange formats

93
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,280
punch cards a bit of the

94
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,489
whole electronics laboratory are the

95
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,799
rooms where we repair where we try

96
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:00,409
to repair the  pieces, however, where

97
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:02,209
we try to limit the damage of time

98
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,610
because our approach is always

99
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,480
that of a museum,

100
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,159
that is, we do not try to

101
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,250
never twist a piece to put it into

102
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,799
operation at all costs but to do the

103
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,769
minimum of interventions necessary to

104
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:18,620
do so if possible  function or maintain it

105
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,509
in an obvious condition where it does not degrade

106
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:22,580
over time

107
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,440
mind always documenting everything with

108
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,240
photographs the state of the piece before

109
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,190
during after so that any

110
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,710
operations then are also reversible

111
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,570
this is an example of restoration that

112
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,460
we will see later and in advance that

113
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,410
those chicken shits and the restoration

114
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,260
was a lot of fun

115
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,360
the part  of research that we try to

116
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,460
carry out is also the one that

117
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,440
concerns the materials in this case you

118
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,539
can clearly see the deterioration of the

119
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:55,580
yellowed plastic plastics those the same

120
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,669
are two terminals the writer of the

121
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:01,520
digital but one is perfect white

122
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,979
the other and yellowed same

123
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,660
historical period two  lots of

124
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,830
different plastics we will see later

125
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,389
the courses that are these scenes of

126
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,000
devastation that you see in the picture are the

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,860
ones that sometimes support us

128
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,500
financially we try to do it in a

129
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,120
little bit because we don't have much

130
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,960
space but recently we have this

131
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,479
electronics course for newbies who

132
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:31,400
we do with piles of old

133
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,760
TV cards from which indeed on which I

134
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,520
force  we have the students to weld

135
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,440
components and then eventually

136
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,060
get to build a radio and things

137
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,470
like this

138
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,880
during the course we explain

139
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,919
how the components work how to put

140
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,530
things together so

141
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,610
this is another course that we have

142
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,560
done with people who are  obviously gone

143
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,820
crazy

144
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,490
events on what are

145
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,410
what are the exhibitions practically

146
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,000
the exhibitions that we do every now

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,150
and then in which among other things we exhibit not only

148
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,890
computers but that everything that

149
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,870
was around us artificial facts

150
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,620
concerning computer science works of art

151
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,970


152
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,800
we did it in syracuse and it

153
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,810
was a hot executioner we will never do it

154
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:24,040
again as I said we do not have help and

155
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,360
everything on a voluntary basis and therefore

156
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,620
we try to save as much as

157
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,570
possible to reuse everything

158
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,340
we have to recover  the components

159
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,370
literally from the garbage recycle

160
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,990
everything we can and above all

161
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,870
have fun because otherwise we would not be

162
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,500
here to do this  ello that we do a large

163
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
part of the fun and dive into the

164
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,920
landfills and go and pull out things

165
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,780
like this so an attentive eye can

166
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,120
see a box at the bottom bm

167
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,180
pc monitor first series in short, this one comes from

168
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,710
rome and a photo of a rome landfill

169
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,930
what we did for example with

170
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,540
the municipality of syracuse is an agreement

171
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,010
whereby we are authorized to enter

172
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,770
the rai area and we are the first in

173
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,820
Italy to have this type of

174
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,100
authorization to select some

175
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,950
parts and implement the European directive which

176
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,570
says that  rai must be

177
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,140
mainly reused then

178
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,340
recycled in their entirety not

179
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,860
broken up to sell plastic metal

180
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,000
etc.

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,470
this occasionally allows us to find

182
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:37,690
something the idea of the museum we

183
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,340
have is that of a

184
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,170
living museum where people can obviously

185
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,390
come within the limits of the possible  to

186
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,300
get your hands on the concert pieces

187
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,790
obviously limit behind supervision

188
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,650
logically if a child arrives  o and he

189
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,330
starts pounding on the keyboard we

190
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,940
become hardly tractable oh how nice

191
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:04,880
sabine but that's how I turn it off now this

192
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,370
so fourth that genius

193
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,170
ok 4 this is not jesus christ he is one of

194
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,030
ours who was wiring a plug in the car

195
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,860
because we had to go for

196
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,710
a  I work how we work what

197
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,120
we do when we do the recoveries but

198
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,980
above all why we do it but these

199
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,600
are good or bad things that you can

200
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,790
imagine all the slides are

201
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,380
let's say generic for a

202
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,220
normal audience and therefore there are things that you can

203
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,500
understand very well this type of

204
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,929
computer and it is  also useful

205
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,659
for teaching because on cards of this

206
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,460
type it is possible to intervene for

207
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,740
repairs in a very simple way

208
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,270
we say in quotation marks

209
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,100
as we said the search for the pieces comes

210
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,660
from landfills but also from

211
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,940
university bodies from companies that dispose of

212
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,650
material etc. and this is the first

213
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,330
what we do we say go and

214
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,390
ask around to inform us on the nose about

215
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:07,010
who could have what and  fter that

216
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,870
often when dealing with

217
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,000
public bodies such as the university the

218
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,610
problem becomes bureaucracy that is you

219
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,530
have to apply to get a piece

220
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,870
that is a junk head to the university

221
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,020
in the corridor for six years and

222
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,000
suddenly at the moment

223
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,640
where you ask it becomes the most precious thing in the

224
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,590
university and they take

225
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,690
three years to give you the authorization to

226
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,280
get it out and then when you go to

227
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,170
retrieve it there are various professors who

228
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,600
stop you and tell you that we can

229
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,850
not we  take it because a whole

230
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,790
series of reasons why in short there is

231
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,550
a bit of collision with these strange mechanisms

232
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,370


233
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,570
then you have to do an inspection because

234
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,279
they tell you we have a computer that

235
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,170
we have to give you yes but you take it

236
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,060
away with the car there is no problem  then

237
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:59,870
go there and find 8 wardrobes 2000

238
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,360
magnetic tapes this we have recovered

239
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,740
but it was a monstrous effort

240
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,300
what we are looking for obviously

241
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,770
everything related to the history of this

242
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,240
mac  china so here I have also written

243
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,149
the furnishings there is some particular chair

244
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:17,120
some object that could have been this

245
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,770
little ribbon holder above or

246
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,230
one you can't see here but there was hanging a

247
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,660
small tree made of

248
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,209
bottle caps with a red croissant hanging  and

249
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:31,070
the system operators told us

250
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,620
that without this tree the system would not

251
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,950
start and every bottle cap of

252
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,680
this tree had a date and the

253
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,310
dates were December 25th and New Year

254
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,500
because they started shutting down

255
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,140
this university machine on December 22nd 23rd

256
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,140
for eni so much gets stuck

257
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,940
and they couldn't turn them off just they have to

258
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,470
wait for the procedures to finish

259
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,240
then they took turns and every now and then a

260
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,399
few years these shifts meant

261
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,950
staying there at Christmas and staying there until

262
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,959
New Year

263
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,760
so they then had the party ii and

264
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,180
hung up  the cap and we have all

265
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:13,579
kept inquiring before recovery also

266
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:15,470
means documentation on

267
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,140
how to disassemble the piece, therefore manuals

268
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,310
disassembly

269
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,990
where are the screws that who knows how to use

270
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,770
which I understand the races etc.

271
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,880
this then also serves to possibly

272
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,620
reassemble the piece

273
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,380
and then program the recovery car crane

274
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,040
van volunteers people boxes

275
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,320
packaging etc. etc. maybe

276
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,970
invite someone who in the past has

277
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,680
used that computer to make us  give a

278
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,560
hand to disassemble it in the right way

279
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,650
I don't know how to park the heads very

280
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,360
professionally we are disassembling an

281
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,150
ibm server to let it pass through a

282
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,410
door in reality it is a machine that

283
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,100
was destroyed because it was not

284
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,010
recoverable and you must always use the

285
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,970
most delicate tools document  it

286
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,580
therefore means taking photos before

287
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,250
disassembling photos during disassembly

288
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,420
position of the cables of the connectors

289
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,060
labels labels that do not come off

290
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:23,470
over the years among other things, among other things, I have already

291
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,610
said this in the double slide documentation

292
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,730
and then transport if you find someone

293
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,700
like this ours  dearest friend who

294
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,880
can give you a rack with only the f

295
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,890
tie two arms of us back there are

296
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,370
like five or six can be very useful

297
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,100
in passing the material we say also

298
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:51,520
in loading it into the truck and then the

299
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,560
transport obviously carried out with care

300
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,560
so packaging avoid that this is

301
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,390
a photo taken catania

302
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,990
while we were doing the recovery

303
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,430
prevent things from scratching each other

304
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,580
then packaging conquered what

305
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,640
can be useful and above all you have to

306
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,700
cover everything with sheets because even

307
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,200
if you, as in this case, make a

308
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,900
recovery in the middle of August in true Sicily,

309
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,940
Giunti louvio della madonna and it

310
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,670
happened there  I assure you that it always happens

311
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,000
then these pieces arrive in the warehouse

312
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,980
but we have a deposit because we have a

313
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,630
lot of computers actually there are

314
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,240
almost two thousand and therefore we must necessarily put them

315
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,370
aside to keep them

316
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,430
conservation is not

317
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,290
put them aside and away because

318
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,420
there are often batteries inside  that go

319
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,580
in acid in reality then it is not only the

320
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,960
batteries we will see it more avant

321
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,240
However, if possible things of this kind

322
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,150
must be removed first so that you put

323
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,040
the piece in safety and you are sure that

324
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,590
in two years you will not find it eaten and

325
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:07,500
corroded by acid to say restoration

326
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,400
that must be done in a highly

327
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,340
professional way with the  use of fire

328
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,300
possibly the first tests means

329
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,580
visual inspection to see if

330
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,320
there are dead rats inside the machines what

331
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,410
happens the dust photograph the

332
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,820
machine to see in what conditions it is to

333
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,530
understand if you need to get your hands on it

334
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,960
immediately if you love the right tools

335
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,460
right time and things like this

336
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,960
test on the electrical part that we will see and

337
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,820
above all if possible copy the data

338
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,520
that is to make an image of the disk or

339
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,170
tapes or what allows the

340
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,700
computer to work this is the

341
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,050
main thing data recovery

342
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,590
data cups with underneath  ionix of

343
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,630
rescue image you all know it

344
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,290
to us this software is a very good friend

345
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,570
and here is a story and the strange one because

346
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,030
I have always used di rescue and it is

347
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,520
called  ava di of fresh underscores then

348
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,410
came debian debian to say in short

349
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,290
and a package was born that was

350
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,120
called di risk and then gd of

351
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,720
risk

352
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,640
so what I do I try to tires who can

353
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,730
no longer find the curses

354
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,560
then they tell me no it's called  gili say

355
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,700
foam [ __ ] off

356
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,190
call it the same way no this no

357
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,220
ok i install it in stall launch i write

358
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,760
gd of rescuecom anno found because

359
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,980
why they called it risk but go

360
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,660
[ __ ] yourself then these are

361
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,510
color stories of hours lost to understand why

362
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,640
a package it  called in a way that

363
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,110
the executables in another oh well to say

364
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,010
if this is a piece of our

365
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,890
recovery station with a nice

366
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,500
magnetic tape reader is a unix machine on

367
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,690
purpose that only makes copies of the data

368
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:11,050
so interventions on the electrical parts but

369
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,300
now maybe  let's see some

370
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,480
examples we talk about rom and eprom that

371
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,280
sometimes you don't know what they are just

372
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,870
memories a window that you

373
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,580
program and delete with  the ultraviolet rays

374
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,960


375
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,400
many of these however are very

376
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,790
old they lose the data and therefore must be

377
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,820
read and rewritten if possible and

378
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,040
then if we want to do some ignition tests

379
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,300
we begin to see if the power supplies

380
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,520
are in a condition where they can be

381
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,110
switched on as in this case yes  they measure

382
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,240
the voltages without cards connected to

383
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,950
empty with a bit of load in short there

384
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,300
are a whole series of procedures that

385
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,970
should be done to avoid putting the

386
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,590
plug and turning on the computer and see

387
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,070
what happens what often many do

388
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,010
with the macintosh dogs sockets income 15

389
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,980
years ago the switch on it worked track with the

390
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,369
world there are a lot of things that

391
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,160
can go wrong unfortunately and then

392
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,319
we have to evaluate whether to do

393
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,329
restoration or not and this is one of

394
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,440
those cases of a scanner or not I think

395
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,900
they have been limited eliminated  it

396
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,959
was aesthetic to clean and wash the

397
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,370
plastics and here it is physically a matter of

398
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,260
going there to clean and possibly

399
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,250
very gently using nothing that  and it is

400
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,320
abrasive so as not to leave scratches so as not to

401
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,610
change the structure

402
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,450
of the surface and I who write

403
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,310
attention to the degreaser president

404
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,420
present the degreaser of the hard

405
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,610
discount the yellow one that cleans

406
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,420
anything cleans so much

407
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,700
that here I am not sure if it shows  but this

408
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,300
is an hp machine stripped from the

409
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,190
degreaser the machines to understand the

410
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,110
80s are stripped which is a

411
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,490
beauty with the same from the

412
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,040
leads to the metal that you were a

413
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,110
mistake of who gave us the piece and of

414
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,330
ceglie I wanted to clean it instead came

415
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,030
away also from paint you have to do

416
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,139
tests and things

417
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,140
so yellowed plastic this is something

418
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,510
that in the field of retro computers isti

419
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,250
and unfortunately it is very used sometimes

420
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,740
just clean the piece well and if it goes well

421
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,550
you can

422
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,290
do our approach is  always to

423
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,270
keep the machines as they are

424
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,920
because very often their conditions

425
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,950
tell us the story of the piece here

426
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,420
unfortunately I have not found the photo  but we

427
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,670
have an amiga commodore who is

428
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,830
fully paid for with markers

429
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,330
and sprays because whoever gave it to us

430
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,400
was a writer he made Italy on the street he

431
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,200
made pieces etc. and so

432
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,090
we kept it as a

433
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,180
collector would have absolutely

434
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,730
cleaned it to make it new  however,

435
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,680
the story of the piece disappears and

436
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,900
the story of those who used it disappears that the thing

437
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,520
that we believe a museum should tell

438
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,800
better therefore why

439
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,980
certain computers were used and how this is an

440
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,720
example of yellowed plastic that you have

441
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,290
already seen in  another slide that is due

442
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,720
to ultraviolet rays and a group of

443
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,640
enthusiasts has invented this

444
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,640
thing called retro bright is a

445
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,310
treatment on the classes a

446
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,260
chemical treatment basically a stuff that

447
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,830
mixes with components that are found

448
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,300
quite common hydrogen peroxide and

449
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,070
other stuff that  I do not remember what happens

450
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,400
yellow chin ultraviolet rays

451
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,120
tear away bromine atoms which is

452
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,710
a flame retardant which  and it is inside

453
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,240
the plastics in the bs

454
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,610
this is the first yellow and then

455
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,800
the yellow color comes out however

456
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,290
this tearing off the atoms actually

457
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,930
creates free radicals that go

458
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,580
around the plastics it is based

459
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,320
chain reaction so atoms keep coming

460
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,690
out  of bromine and free radicals continue to be

461
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,730
created and the plastic

462
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,520
turns yellow more and more the system

463
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,290
they invented replaces in a

464
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,030
sense the bromine atoms which are

465
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,620
yellow with oxygen atoms hydrogen

466
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,010
peroxide which is transparent white

467
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,360
then the plastic becomes white again

468
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,770


469
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,720
this however weakens the plastic at the molecular level

470
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,370
because the

471
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,020
atomic weight of bromine is higher than that of

472
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,360
oxygen the plastic becomes

473
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,610
slightly more porous more

474
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,740
free radicals enter and in the long run the

475
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,860
problem arises again and

476
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,510
even in some cases it gets worse

477
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,120
these are  this a car that was

478
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,130
in this condition was bleached and

479
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,920
then stored in the dark in a temperat  ura

480
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,620
constant for two years and returned

481
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,960
yellow with a whole series of

482
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,630
stains induced by whitening

483
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,590
so it did even more damage

484
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:06,090
unfortunately there is no one who seems to me that here

485
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:10,350
I put a link is the painting and

486
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,809
we are always there is an intervention  that

487
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:15,299
apart from that it is not reversible so

488
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,059
unusually it does not make sense

489
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:20,100
and then this are not painted it

490
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,169
would look completely different is I know

491
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:29,010
but you are not telling me like I have

492
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,110
a greek vase and it tells me you tried to

493
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,900
repaint it that sense

494
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,220
has our approach is that understood the

495
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,320
piece is that must be kept not

496
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,559
distorted it repainted it is more

497
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,030
beautiful in fact we find the commodore 64

498
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:47,840
blue to say but it is another thing

499
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,020
electrical part and here we have problems

500
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,610
on the connectors we have problems on

501
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,500
electronic components whose chemistry  it

502
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,169
degrades inside false contacts

503
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:02,940
maybe there are no wiring diagrams on

504
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,890
which to intervene

505
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,570
this the speech of the pros I said

506
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,950
that they lose the data for which they go

507
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,960
sometimes replace these eproms but on

508
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,480
old machines they are no longer found

509
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,730
so you have to play games with

510
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,110
jumpers etc. to adapt and

511
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,320
promote in cases like these we

512
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,270
remove the old eprom we keep

513
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,610
it aside as a find and put the

514
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,140
new ones if we want to make the

515
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,470
machine work  always keep the pieces that

516
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,540
are replaced because they are

517
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,250
always part of the piece and of the

518
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,600
battery history apart from those we have

519
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,670
seen in the other slide there are bacteria and

520
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,230
hidden inside these cursed

521
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,380
dallas which are the chips of the real time

522
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,410
clock which, however, are  they can open with the

523
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,900
dremel you can take out the battery and

524
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,160
maybe put a connector

525
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,990
for a button battery as here in this is

526
00:22:53,990 --> 00:23:07,820
a repair done they are in yes but

527
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,890
in this case from what we have

528
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,059
seen we do not corrode it swells a bit

529
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,669
in  theory should remain there but

530
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:21,049
replacing them would also be better because

531
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:22,700
the internal battery could

532
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,500
short out so it could s  overburden

533
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,720
something else I would not always know better

534
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,730
remove at least the line of lost

535
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,380
the settings it seems to me that it no

536
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,850
longer booted automatically or something

537
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,000
like that

538
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,380
where is this is a scheme that concerns

539
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,690
the dallas that established bmps 2 same

540
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:50,740
problem same battery  and it is this here

541
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,330
or some do the wire they put the

542
00:23:53,330 --> 00:24:00,350
external battery things like this examples of

543
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,960
restoration this black spot a ncr which

544
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,290
was called tower 6 50 whose fitter at

545
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,110
a certain point made a boom it

546
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,799
exploded and here nothing wiring diagrams

547
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,169
nothing at all

548
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:16,669
there  'we still kept this

549
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:18,260
power supply because we have not been able

550
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,330
to repair it so far nor have it repaired

551
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,160
by those who know more than us and so we

552
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,840
decided ok let's try to understand how it

553
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,640
works is becoming king because it is a

554
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,190
slaughterhouse one piece and this is another

555
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,679
piece and  that is, this is not in

556
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,390
simple quotes like those of today it is a

557
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,940
switching power supply but from the

558
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,470
80s so here we had to do a bit of

559
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,240
revers  and engineering on the board and

560
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,330
go and try to understand step by step he

561
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,730
had to where the signals went that

562
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,770
voltage was going out etc. to

563
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,740
then try to find a pattern like

564
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,160
this to which we then added

565
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,720
pieces with the words natal do not

566
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,540
delete because the blackboard was

567
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,350
used a little  by all until then in any case

568
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,910
we arrived at being able to mount a

569
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,160
pc power supply and make the

570
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,800
cigar machine work

571
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,960
ok this is one of the things that

572
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,450
can be done let's say the original power supply

573
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,090
and set aside one day

574
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,640
an electronics genius will arrive and

575
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,170
be able to  repair it or not

576
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,910
this the most beautiful case let's say more

577
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,370
fun that of the chicken blackbird

578
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,850
this was in a chicken coop st computer

579
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,230
so it was in these conditions

580
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,940
when they gave us but the chicken [ __ ] was

581
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,679
also inside because there was a myth

582
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,880
something like this  and then it was

583
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,410
completely disassembled piece by piece

584
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,040
everything was washed by hand it was

585
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,030
a frenzy in the tub from the shower

586
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:57,210
gua  nti however the beauty that it is back to

587
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,580
work one says it is impossible that a

588
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,440
machine so ruined can

589
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,210
start working again instead it may be

590
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,650
in reality this resin is not

591
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,030
plastic it was a resin casey and we arrive

592
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:16,679
the capacitors that the most common thing

593
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:18,780
that happens especially this  make and

594
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,460
redo the cursed redo

595
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,730
here small wiring diagram I hope to

596
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,740
be simple enough this is an

597
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,490
apple macintosh the first macintosh and

598
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,110
laurent done one thing probably

599
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,090
for legal reasons that is

600
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,070
the power supply is back and immediately there is a

601
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,960
line filter after the filter  in ninea there is the

602
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,130
power button

603
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,140
this means that you have the mac

604
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,910
turned off inserted with the plug but that

605
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,720
part is always live

606
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,710
ok in that part there are

607
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,810
filter capacitors to us at night it

608
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,960
happened this went on fire  a mac

609
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,440
turned off then we enter the laboratory and

610
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,050
there was smoke everything in the room

611
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,610
where the car is on fire and here it is

612
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:06,970
all

613
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,170
disconnected then to the nose s  we went to

614
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,090
the mac and it was he we opened it he

615
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,500
found this fortunately

616
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,050
this fire went out but it burned

617
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,600
a whole series of components we

618
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,679
changed them and it still works

619
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,970
this is the reason why I

620
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,950
always tell those who have a computer  history of

621
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,110
not even plug it into the

622
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,850
electric plug in the socket because

623
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,270
this evil can happen that goes with a bang

624
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:39,130
like here in smoke it stinks but if it gets worse

625
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,760
everything goes on fire that is when a house was on fire

626
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,680
to say this and les paul ii

627
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,480
this was inside a  honeywell terminal

628
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,600
always the same type of capacitor

629
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,680
so I went too far

630
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,120
we asked the raffle we

631
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,920
wrote to the parent company because your

632
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,540
verna fuoco capacitors

633
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,760
never answered us

634
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,680
and he still reproduces these

635
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,070
damn

636
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,600
magnetic tapes and magnetic media in general

637
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,169


638
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:14,690
other problem i  tapes are not eternal

639
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,389
unfortunately the chemistry that concerns the

640
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:19,429
surface of the tape degrades over

641
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:24,590
time by not entering it  The patch is all a

642
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,570
bla bla there is a speech of polymers

643
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,970
that disintegrate and become sticky the

644
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,379
moment you read on a

645
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:32,389
head this happens of tears off

646
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:34,100
all the magnetic material and remains

647
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,369
stuck to the head with a huge

648
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:41,869
error like here that  the

649
00:28:41,869 --> 00:28:44,029
jammed tape and the crap that is

650
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:50,779
removed with a cotton swab fair the cases

651
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:52,970
are different they are documented

652
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,139
luckily there is a lot of research

653
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:57,320
especially for the audio there are the

654
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,029
tapes for example in acetate that have

655
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,179
another type of problems they start to

656
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:03,980
generate acetic acid that comes out

657
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,460
just like a liquid which

658
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,049
acetic acid is corrosive this time and therefore

659
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:10,669
corrodes everything around

660
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:11,929
so if perhaps the tape

661
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:13,580
stored in a metal drawer

662
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,570
finds all the rust it

663
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:21,859
happens that the heat sometimes helps to

664
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,659
read these belts then you take

665
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:25,609
the belts you do a cooking in the oven at a

666
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:27,409
certain temperature ventilated oven

667
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:31,279
for a certain time they take place  is place

668
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,259
in a certain way

669
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:35,179
these tapes in reality these ovens

670
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:37,279
cost a lot of money but someone

671
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,299
has discovered that the croissants to make

672
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:44,389
dried fruit to dry peppers

673
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:46,489
dried tomatoes these things here have the

674
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:48,080
same precise size of

675
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,499
magnetic tapes are stackable are

676
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:53,210
programmable  with a timer and a

677
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,519
thermostat so it works very well we

678
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,980
use we have an identical one then you

679
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,389
sell the tape you put it there it is

680
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:04,970
cooked and then you can try a reading

681
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,470
then it depends a lot on the master

682
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,019
luckily we have

683
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:11,850
this we see it after we have 2000

684
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,950
magnetic tapes of  those of the famous

685
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,970
truck transport

686
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,309
we have selected by type so

687
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:20,100
when they tell us we have a

688
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,860
magnetic tape to retrieve a memorex 4 we

689
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,179
go and see them we

690
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:26,100
do the tests on our sticks that

691
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,519
contain nothing when we are ready

692
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,169
we have the procedure we reproduce it on

693
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:33,480
that is so we are pretty sure

694
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,419
to succeed in fact so far we are

695
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,769
rius  cite in data recovery

696
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:43,889
in this way we can do the tests then

697
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:48,240
strange cases happen here we had to

698
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,129
copy these pizzas you see here

699
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:52,889
these magnetic disks of pdp 11 that

700
00:30:52,889 --> 00:30:57,059
is here we have made a box cluster via

701
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,850
network with an emulated machine in si

702
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,369
brand that is there and  so we made the

703
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:04,919
images of the discs that we then use in the

704
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:10,619
bricklayer we have online for 0 2 if

705
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:14,610
you are 1 2 3 4 5 but we no longer have

706
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,700
the twenty copied in luckily in short,

707
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,619
suddenly the player jams it

708
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:23,009
seems to you the enterprise that  the disk has

709
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:24,110
jammed

710
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,139
the head does not move anymore so he

711
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:30,779
curses first of all then big coffee pot

712
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:34,470
so we were with manual vampires

713
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,450
wiring diagrams we begin to do all

714
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,429
the tests see this is the circuitry

715
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,840
that drives the head etc. etc.

716
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,190
and then we use a system that we often use we

717
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,690
begin to  looking

718
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,179
intently at the piece that broke

719
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:54,389
saying fix and in looking

720
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:56,009
we realized something we

721
00:31:56,009 --> 00:32:00,619
realized the problem qu  i you can't see it well

722
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:03,299
but here it is a small piece of plastic that

723
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:05,279
had slipped into the guide of the head

724
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,889
then had it stuck in a small

725
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:09,330
piece that had flown off one of the

726
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,779
disks detached the piece started to

727
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,369
work etc. that are things that

728
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:15,890


729
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,930
always happen with the  plastics that break

730
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:24,860
and weaken then we did a

731
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,180
test we took an image of

732
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,890
ratzinger we copied it to the disk

733
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:31,570
we saw that it works and then ok

734
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:38,360
it worked so okay this is a

735
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,960
list of our

736
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,870
ways of acting  get informed do not try to

737
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,220
repair they seem to be the

738
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,400
right tools that is you cannot open something and

739
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,810
then leave it on the table for a

740
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:55,010
week start and finish cataloging

741
00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:03,710
everything back up etc. here a

742
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,970
small overview of a reconstruction

743
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,440
we have done are a few photos

744
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,230
we have reconstructed an apple 1 because

745
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,300
because because it is beautiful we liked the idea

746
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,890
of doing it we found an american

747
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,770
who made blank cards without

748
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,750
com  ponents then we said to ourselves oh well let's do

749
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,960
it again and then we said to ourselves well

750
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,370
then let's do it with criteria

751
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,870
let's go and look for the components

752
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,670
of the time this we got the idea in

753
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,090
2006 with great desperation that

754
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,030
we realized that it was not so easy

755
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,380
then  they made us a whole list of

756
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,900
electronic components needed to

757
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,550
make this board we did a year

758
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,370
and a half of google search there we

759
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,780
went to see all the photos of the

760
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,210
original apple 1 to understand the take-

761
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,690
off and the production date the month of

762
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:54,320
production of  every integrated announced to

763
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,970
we need this here from 1976

764
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,290
twenty-fifth week go google

765
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,570
ebay search etc.

766
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,760
we found good or bad all we

767
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,989
made one a list of the originals with

768
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,730
the descriptions of the components their

769
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,409
color the physical appearance etc.

770
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:17,770
the photos then we arrived the card we

771
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,710
started to do the assemblies a lot of the

772
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,329
stuff we use and of the time so he has the

773
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:23,770
right to use the soldering iron of the

774
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:31,199
70s and this  to it is a detail for example

775
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,329
these here absolutely impossible to find

776
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:36,668
or those who sell them sell them at

777
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:39,239
exorbitant prices because they are pole 1

778
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,799
that is sticazzi cannot spend 800

779
00:34:41,799 --> 00:34:44,649
euros for 40 integrated circuit sockets

780
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,299


781
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:47,589
we said to ourselves little voice that had

782
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:49,000
designed the apple 1 for  to be

783
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,770
cheap we tried zocco cheaper beds

784
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,359
they got me those

785
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:54,339
we used the same philosophy

786
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:56,980
let's say and then we found

787
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,319
strange things in an integrated of the time there was

788
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:01,690
an inclusion of a copper wire in the

789
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,569
keys sticking out of the integrated

790
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,039
this  we kept it aside as a

791
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:12,039
curiosity then it worked in short

792
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,900
we have it ii it is on display you can

793
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,640
use it quite funny as

794
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,890
a tetris machine

795
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,390
this is another reconstruction that

796
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:25,420
we have made but software for obvious

797
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,279
reasons because the tetris was

798
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:32,200
developed imac and  nostalgia when there was

799
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,059
still the soviet bloc so

800
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:39,339
russia and etcetera etc was

801
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:40,750
developed on cars that the russians

802
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,420
they copied from the Americans and this is an

803
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,700
example they cloned the

804
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,730
cell machines there was espionage then they

805
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,809
procured the American machines

806
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:51,329
they did a reverse engineering they

807
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:54,640
redid the same if not better in

808
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,119
many cases that maybe then we will see

809
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,260
like this the machine on which the

810
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,369
tetris was born was  a clone of a pd plus 11 23

811
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:08,079
which is what they called

812
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,839
electronica 60 practically identical

813
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,089
as you see same switches were

814
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:15,569
cine

815
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,980
they also did a lot of things

816
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,330
apart from cloning the hardware that they don't have

817
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,010
the software but they improved it because the

818
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,040
pdp 11  23 is a high rack like this with the

819
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,530
external disk and a pan with the

820
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,540
8-inch floppies and things like that

821
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,740
they closed it in a that the little one by

822
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,970
integrating the 1000 terminal into the

823
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,310
monitor and keyboard and with the floppies from

824
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,350
five to fourth then  the pd plus 11 23

825
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,200
became a desktop machine so they

826
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,790
improved absolutely true they are

827
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:49,890
also cheaper and the

828
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,260
operating systems they too were practical.

829
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,630
copied entity this is called demos but it is a

830
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,970
kind of ionix derived from bsd that

831
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:03,270
they copied and it is a unique Russian

832
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,369
practically this is the group that

833
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:09,750
developed that I copy and pirate what

834
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,550
was ds at the time and then in this

835
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,500
research center c  'it was this scientist

836
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:22,320
who in short for test reasons created

837
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,280
this tetris game that worked on

838
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,350
a terminal

839
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,030
and here the interesting thing that we were

840
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,430
able to find the executable there is the

841
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,780
whole story here of the things

842
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,340
now the slides and they come  from another

843
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,560
situation for which I do not long because

844
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,900
the tetris was then copied by these

845
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,340
researchers who gave it around a

846
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,710
person I develop the software for a pc which

847
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,530
was then copied by an

848
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,050
English manufacturer who wanted to market

849
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,820
it sought authorization  from the Russians

850
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,170
he could not contact them so he

851
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,560
copied it and remade and sold another

852
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,300
house he copied it and sold it in

853
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,920
turn, in short, it is a whole story of

854
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,820
super piracy

855
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,920
and therefore at the  ra is five minutes I

856
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,980
absolutely have to squeeze we

857
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,559
found the executable and we decided to

858
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:17,230
copy and not care about the copyright

859
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,789
too and then we did

860
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:21,400
our reproduction of the tetris find

861
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,130
the program write the emulator

862
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:33,670
recover it etc. and then

863
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,200
configure a termination in Cyrillic

864
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,420
in short, the result and in the end that we

865
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:43,499
with many tears and with the anthem of

866
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:45,579
the Russian army managed to

867
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:48,009
make the tetris work on the pdp 11 23

868
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,890
and from us that is the thing we say is

869
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,119
closest to what was the

870
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,710
original machine since it was

871
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,619
copied other games

872
00:38:56,619 --> 00:38:59,190
of the time also entered

873
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,230
this is red october which is a clone of

874
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:08,829
star trek clones pdp 11 to close

875
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:11,049
this part they took the pdp

876
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,390
11 as a cpu they packed it in a

877
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,480
home keyboard  computer that was then

878
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,970
sold as a computer for

879
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,789
people's homes for schools and for those who

880
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:23,470
could afford it then but it was a

881
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,809
home computer

882
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:27,190
imagine u  a keyboard like the comfortable

883
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,890
64 which is actually a pdp 11 and

884
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:32,619
runs software pdp 11 left by the

885
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:35,130
incredible improvements in hardware

886
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:39,700
this is another example of a clone in

887
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,529
general well I go ahead because there is no

888
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:44,499
more time but we realized  that the

889
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:46,269
build quality of these

890
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:49,329
copied machines was enormous

891
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:50,440
this is a machine from

892
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,910
east germany that came to us in these

893
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,890
conditions because we know very well that

894
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,109
whoever makes the shipments a dog the packs of

895
00:39:56,109 --> 00:39:58,299
treats kicks for which

896
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:02,470
destroyed germany of '  it's incredible big car

897
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,150
with

898
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,890
and when we opened we realized the

899
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,900
quality of construction the

900
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,069
wire bindings in with the aeronautical standard things

901
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:13,890
of this type

902
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,000
here the problem we had

903
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,410
was with the flyback that

904
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,260
developed as I said acetic acid

905
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,059
has flaked off  we just turned on it

906
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:24,400
started to smoke and

907
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,599
flyback we were forced to take it

908
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,400
apart sorry if I run and

909
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,170
basically restart  olger it amanda

910
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,740
after various attempts and reconstructions that

911
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,329
we have from which we have set fire to out of

912
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:40,059
anger however we have managed to

913
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:44,859
put it back into operation by wrapping love

914
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:50,980
coils sighs in short then the

915
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,480
one in the jars has worked transformations

916
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,039
dedication disassembled and destroyed

917
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,270
this is an example of how

918
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,740
that computer is built  that is, all the masses

919
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,010
end up on a threaded bar as if

920
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,760
it were the electrical system of the house

921
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,400
very strong very heavy machine all

922
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,440
on sliding guides so you can

923
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,599
extract the monitor can extract the

924
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,319
floppies you can intervene on everything

925
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,609
this is the back part with the parts

926
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:22,539
extracted and this the monitor to

927
00:41:22,539 --> 00:41:24,849
intervene on the cards and the cards

928
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,819
open like a fan which is magnificent to

929
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,559
work with it just done to

930
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:31,779
intervene on any aspect of the

931
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:32,549
computer

932
00:41:32,549 --> 00:41:34,599
this we have also seen in other

933
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:36,539
pieces this a

934
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:40,420
double redundant modular switching power supply opens

935
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,270
fan and we work on the cards

936
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,680
also

937
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,060
qu  I esto a radio that we took for

938
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,470
a historical reconstruction that we

939
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,330
always did east germany with the

940
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,480
card that fanned out with the

941
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,980
beautiful long wires how many times did you

942
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,900
open a radio to repair it the children

943
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,730
were very short and there is to blaspheme

944
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,609
for  do not detach them here instead everything is already

945
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:06,560
prepared and this is an exhibition we

946
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,450
did in Rome in which we have not

947
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,980
only exhibited the pieces but we have

948
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,869
confessed them as they were machines

949
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:12,920
from East Germany

950
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,470
we have reconstructed a corner of

951
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,700
what could have been an office

952
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,530
from the stasis the secret police of

953
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,380
east germany then trinkets

954
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,300
documents of the stasis that we

955
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,240
downloaded from the internet lamp and

956
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,400
things like that wiretapping etc.

957
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,930
this is another east germany computer

958
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,880
with the recorders he was

959
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,250
designed to work with and the tv of

960
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,300
germany  from the east who sent

961
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:45,050
us old documentation these are

962
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:49,210
Russian IT magazines as you can see

963
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,530
ep  We have exhibited

964
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,680
cars from the soviet block and cars

965
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,349
from west germany

966
00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:00,650
in the middle put some barbed wire and

967
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,130
above all a bit of scene

968
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:08,750
logically to contextualise but

969
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,130
we mostly dressed like

970
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:10,760
morons

971
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,170
because we don't have fun the thing

972
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,680
ends there

973
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:22,720
we joined the  cosplay to

974
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,289
retrocomputing okay i would say thats

975
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:32,730
all thanks for submitting

976
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,150
questions i am around
