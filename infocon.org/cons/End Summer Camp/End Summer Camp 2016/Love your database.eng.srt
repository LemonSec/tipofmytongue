1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
just arrived at the top claudio database at

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,400
esc 2016

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,420
i am chris meyer

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,429
then the title of this top i

5
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,940
got it from the mailing lists the posts you

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,529
probably know posts that are

7
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,380
present here if i see that people say yes to me

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,490


9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,010
practically the database  most advanced

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,109
open source in the world and on the mailing

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,410
list the posts that there was a priest this

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,320
May which was called the startup

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,590
database where one person

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,020
complained said well I continue to

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,899
collaborate with developers who do

16
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,860
n't really know what  'is the sql today they have

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,930
this fairly widespread idea that if

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,280
those are the classic select staff

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,649
table that they learned like 25 years

20
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,340
ago and they didn't want to from there so they

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,640
don't use it they use it badly etc. and

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,820
asked for a bit of ideas what

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,130
people thought about what experience they had

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,450


25
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,790


26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,720


27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,210


28
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,890


29
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,700
etc.  today as today it shows then

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:34,110
which of you uses them those of also

31
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,970
many people

32
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,710
who of you know well post cras who

33
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,700
are the courage to get up from yes ok

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,710
fine then here are the things that I

35
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,630
brought you I took this road

36
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,619
long enough I took six points  at

37
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,340
random practically and 5 points are

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,280
practically fisher and if those more or

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,409
less and if the standard ones that you

40
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,550
also find in other systems other

41
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,130
rdbms products and the sixth fisher

42
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,600
perhaps the most contested was the use of

43
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,850
procedural sequelae therefore of the

44
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,410
famous stops so already  in the development today

45
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,210
we say on the mailing list they

46
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,730
all agreed that there is by chance also

47
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,150
the lancer they had realized that

48
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,100
these five fishermen were fishermen

49
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,630
not to be lost and on this

50
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,160
there was some interesting discussion

51
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,940
on the pros and cons of using it  in the

52
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,450
modern api cash and development let's

53
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,580
say if there is a moment to discuss

54
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,700
maybe even after the states it is

55
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,860
interesting to discuss this

56
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,550
p  anointed here then let's start immediately with the

57
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,610
first point such a chris not me

58
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,890
another chris threw there that it is one

59
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,750
of the beautiful things about them that in

60
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,300
a certain sense then seeing it as a

61
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,280
functional language clearly is not

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,660
but has some characteristics some

63
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,130
let's say the  feeling is like dealing with

64
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,930
a functional language where you no

65
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,540
longer use loops you no longer use conditionals

66
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,720
etc. but it does it in another way

67
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,030
here is the example I brought you here

68
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,800
enough let's say probably

69
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,990
known to all

70
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,930
good example not consistent I have to say

71
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,680
the  example are the nobel prizes and I follow

72
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,770
this query here if the former nobel taffon

73
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,440
then I select all the nobel winners

74
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,550
and I put the classic web that makes me a

75
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,770
filter and then I also put an order

76
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,870
here are some I keep a part of the

77
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,040
nobel winners

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,140
what happens if  now I want to

79
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,420
answer a somewhat more difficult question

80
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,090
let's say that he won the Nobel Prize in

81
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,050
Chemistry in 1900 05

82
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,730
or when he was

83
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,260
awarded the first car prize  name

84
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,720
or even a more difficult level

85
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,229
who has won more than one award

86
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,450
now think for a moment in

87
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,580
your favorite procedural language

88
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,870
how would you solve a

89
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,720
specific in this way here well

90
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,479
obviously I'm talking about the last one here

91
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,120
you would probably cycle over

92
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,150
all  nobel prizes

93
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,900
you should put the wing each winner in

94
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,800
a kind of stage where you increase the

95
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,600
count every time you see the

96
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,750
same win and then do another cycle

97
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,660
on the keys of the effe blair to

98
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,750
filter with unifi and the count more

99
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,620
than one such a thing

100
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,720
if you do it with a

101
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,490
functional programming language and you don't do

102
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,070
all that you would not have non-west loops and

103
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,620
iv probably there would be a nice

104
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,440
combination of readius filter that I know

105
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,810
somehow you can come up with

106
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,150
well and if those kind of do

107
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,830
exactly  this

108
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,740
you see with a fairly

109
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,190
simple change I can use the close having that

110
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,220
filters me after aggregation say io

111
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,810
vog  lio those who have the count

112
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,000
greater than 1 and here are some

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,750
the winners of more than one nobel prize come out

114
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,240
and this surely is a let's say

115
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,700
functional way of solving things in the

116
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,919
sense that it does not use cycles and does not use iv

117
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,570
so if the next time  talk

118
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,110
to the level for javascript which is very

119
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,419
receptive to these functional things

120
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:04,450
maybe throw it like this here

121
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,430
and you will see that maybe it will say

122
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,180
it's nice comfortable

123
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:16,090
here second point said that a

124
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,550
standard programmer does not think in

125
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,340
sets while and second reason in

126
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,830
sets I brought you  an example also

127
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,710
very simple here are dates of August

128
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,290
which date is missing which data is missing you

129
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,090
know it is a bit difficult mid-August

130
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,320
is missing

131
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,910
here is how you could do in them

132
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,130
those how you could do in a

133
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,020
procedural language well enough

134
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,030
complicated it remains in a sense to have

135
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,950
pass  from one date to another see with

136
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,170
a look up if that date exists if there is not

137
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,180
put it aside etc. of new

138
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,770
and surprising schools  emente easy then

139
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,290
generated with this first those networks

140
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,200
generate all the dates of August here

141
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,960
clearly there is a touch to the next sly

142
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,040
I explain the trick to you and then you do an ex and

143
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,720
select all the data of the table

144
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,560
calm except allows you to combine the

145
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,610
results of a  queries with

146
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,580
set operators weight first I'll explain the

147
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,310
trick of the first thing coral and the

148
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,490
touch of this is that among big teams in

149
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,710
practically all products and schools

150
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,590
the now data

151
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,530
arithmetic date is a recognized native type

152
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,320
this here  it is put in iso mode

153
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,100
so it recognizes the iso date and

154
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,420
adds the integer which then generates the

155
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,880
zero date days after the 1st of August one

156
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,210
day after the 1st of August etc.

157
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,340
generic and if a function that generates

158
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,790
a table with numbers from zero  to 31 32

159
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,700
to 30 therefore practically all

160
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,000
the August data is generated clearly here as well

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,800
as except there is also an inter sec and they are

162
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,570
practically the three operators in themselves

163
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,570
mystical that you have very often na one thing

164
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,550
bright enough it becomes easily

165
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,970
solved if you think together and not in

166
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:27,070
east and black cycles these things here the

167
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,030
third point is this has been introduced

168
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,010
in the standard if those should

169
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,840
now be present in some all the

170
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,390
products are the so-called common table

171
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,390
expressions there the problem  and that in

172
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,570
them those you often use sap select 16

173
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,110
selecta from opens brackets to between

174
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,550
those from opens high brackets query and at

175
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,440
a certain point you find yourself in front of a

176
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,910
query that you understand for about a minute

177
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,120
and 35 minutes you already do not understand it anymore

178
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,900
because so  strange nested etc. and

179
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,050
with monte blacks presence they

180
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:12,550
introduced the uim this here uil where you

181
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,370
define give a name to a soap select

182
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,830
this is a soap select it goes from here to here

183
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,860
it calls it original sales this another

184
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,240
top hagens goes from here to here  and then comes

185
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,560
the select who uses regional sales and

186
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,520
jeans top she uses them in the sense that she has

187
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,800
registered the name but it is not a

188
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,360
view a persistent view this is not

189
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,520
persistent us  ata only for this query

190
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,400
here this those woes of the manual post

191
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,600
that if now there is really no

192
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,770
temple for the time to cut it but it is

193
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,940
clear that it is much more eligible

194
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,590
than a situation in which this

195
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,780
sub if she were nestled in here and

196
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,410
even this nestled in the ni data the

197
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,630
beauty of weezy is that now you say oh well

198
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,970
a syntactic convenience but in

199
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,960
build beta is that there is the possibility of doing

200
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,830
with recursive recursive in the sense

201
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,490
that here I have an example we have a

202
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,150
table that represents a tree

203
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,430
let's say a geographic table to

204
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,950
italy the veneto venice the municipality

205
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:28,300
of venice and finally it is pronounced tessera

206
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,149
or tesserate evening

207
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,839
exact this here is put inside a

208
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,970
table in the way more if there are several

209
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,490
pieces of furniture map a tree in a table

210
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,500
in them those this is one  of the

211
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,380
simplest ones with the parent it

212
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,740
ok how can we pull out

213
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,980
let's say will weave the relatives will test well

214
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,040
I have to make a joint then joint can

215
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,320
weave I see at enel is part of the

216
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,060
municipality of  venice well but I don't know how to

217
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,050
go on

218
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,970
I should do a high joint to bring

219
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,830
out the province the region but I don't know

220
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,540
the depth in general not only in-

221
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,930
depth of the thing and it was a

222
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,820
problem that cannot be solved at

223
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,589
all in the if that where he writes a

224
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,500
procedure  now with wiz and it becomes very

225
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,959
easy because then defining with appeals

226
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,790
okay name not very imaginative f in

227
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,029
which we then say write a query the

228
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:36,270
first ones in here is

229
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,430
executed for the first time which requires

230
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,660
f then do union north and these are

231
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,480
these are the query that is called at the

232
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,290
subsequent calls of f where f is part

233
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,630
of this query here so in a certain

234
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,839
sense it is recursive and this pulls me for

235
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,220
example out of the whole hierarchy you see

236
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,830
that there is the same comune venezia

237
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,420
province of venice veneto  italy

238
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,690
europe while it obviously does not bring out

239
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,029
all the others I had and they

240
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,060
have nothing to do with slovenia padova

241
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,310
there is in this is a jus asked as a

242
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,610
table express chance c  he goes beyond

243
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,260
just the syntactic let's say very

244
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,540
interesting other thing jayson here

245
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,850
now obviously as a modern developer

246
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,010
you know everything about jayson

247
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,780
and therefore very briefly to

248
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:42,400
save some time that ok I in

249
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,880
poster in many other products or a

250
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,600
native type jason unfortunately is not

251
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,220
standardized in the sense that the way

252
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,290
you use it a little different from product to

253
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,690
product but thank goodness it is not

254
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,020
difficult to use it that allows me to

255
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,850
save a let's say a serialization

256
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,370
jace with like this when here or name

257
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,380
xy three keys in one

258
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,850
database field natively in particular

259
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,040
if I decide to use jayson b it is

260
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,930
saved in binary mode so it is already

261
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,460
prepared very efficient and or a rich

262
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,710
seven operators and functions to access

263
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,650
to manipulate the individual fields for

264
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,100
example here I write select data I use

265
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,620
this operator to extract  the key

266
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,640
name I call it name from the table to

267
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,650
mineo champion marco me in him

268
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,980
here this clearly works also

269
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,590
with  the planes works with multiple levels

270
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,870
I can chain these operators

271
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,550
etc. etc.

272
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,640
I can if I also want to mix it I can

273
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,520
mix a relational design with a

274
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,950
non-relational design it is based on

275
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,770
jackson here I put it well this is

276
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,620
the operator explained extracts a field and

277
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,900
transforms in the head is  just one example

278
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
there are so many

279
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,790
expected here there had to be a slide

280
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,370
that I got lost on the way that

281
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:24,000
shows the function to jayson that can

282
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,830
put on any query I can

283
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,370
say select jayson nobel from nobel

284
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,340
nobel the means the whole star line

285
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,290
practically  the poker can enter the

286
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,440
name of the table to indy

287
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,690
identify all the record and then

288
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,930
instead of giving me behind a table as

289
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,130
we are used

290
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,640
to it it returns me mit it returns all the

291
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,770
records directly in j so if

292
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,870
I are programmers we say that

293
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,700
program in javascript program

294
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,250
so  very modern in quotes I don't

295
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,160
have to go through the record set

296
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,320
there in between goes well I have to call it a  sometimes

297
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,300
this yes but then to all my

298
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,970
data structure maybe even not flat not

299
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,240
a row but with some trees

300
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,570
let's say directly in jayson I am

301
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,500
therefore not forced to absolutely

302
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,960
transform my shredded date if one

303
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,820
were if I have something semi-

304
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,400
structured in a  relational model if

305
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,680
I do not want there would also be xml xml

306
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,750
is not old let's say that we have been supporting it

307
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,450
for many years so that is what

308
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,520
I have not even mentioned is jay I am large

309
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,569
newer

310
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,200
ok the last fisher esquel more or less

311
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,720
standard subjects I want to mention

312
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,800
are  I sell them function then if you

313
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,190
write a bit of sql you

314
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,380
certainly know the group is the classic

315
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,340
goodbye that aggregates records aggregates them from

316
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,620
many records it creates single records

317
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,430
I think I have an exact example here

318
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,160
or the winners of the nobel prizes before

319
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,370
1900 3 or 5 elia  greek by subject then

320
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,220
what do I show the visualize the

321
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,620
subject the true count a there are

322
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,250
four in medicine and 7 in physics 6 in

323
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,530
peace etc.  it was

324
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,390
now in here

325
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,580
clearly there would be the single

326
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,010
records are the four names

327
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,340
the four years for now I have lost them that is

328
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,290
the gup ai destroyed them the wolves

329
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,570
put them in a closed box the box and I

330
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,870
don't see them anymore what it would take

331
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,660
a  group and a little finer

332
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,860


333
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,540
and more articulated and this is what winds of

334
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,130
function do then the trick is here there is

335
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,140
the motivation first then the trick is

336
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,240
that I would like to have the win

337
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,420
I cannot do so it does not work well

338
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,160
miles that works because corn  quell

339
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,369
does anything but normally it

340
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,950
shouldn't work because it tells

341
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,920
you well you asked me to group by

342
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,410
subject within the group there are

343
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,950
many winners there is not only one winner if

344
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,960
I want to view these four

345
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,910
medicine award winners what

346
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,660
I have

347
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,640
to actually do boschessa a very

348
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,520
nice function that stream ag which returns to you

349
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,250
let's say a field grouped as csv or

350
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,770
even as in short separated from what

351
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,280
you want

352
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,240
this is incredible  useful mind you can tell

353
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,210
from miss trina guinea and here you have these

354
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,730
winners which are 41 23 then i cut

355
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,440
very comfortable but clearly this is

356
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,380
a bit necchi no limits of funk this they

357
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,600
do it in a more surgical way i am

358
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,950
practically the keyboard is over to

359
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,870
add over ha  an

360
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,000
aggregation function and becomes a window of

361
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,410
funk in what time still ok perfect

362
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,820
so here I write count over and the rest

363
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,070
is identical so what happens

364
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,620
that what was wrong before

365
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,700
it goes I now see the result

366
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,260
of the aggregation function that

367
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,510
now it has become navindra function

368
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,570
even if it is still called account

369
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:44,380
26 but I can access the single records

370
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,230
I see and this is one record the other

371
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,660
the other etc. all 26 not

372
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,030
grouped away I did the count but not

373
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,780
grouped them now here you will say  yes

374
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,820
oh well but this now go to the

375
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,940
count on all 26

376
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,490
what happens if I still want to

377
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,040
group them by subject and the count

378
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,310
of the individual subjects rho the t  rucco is that

379
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,320
discreet so it doesn't make much sense in

380
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,650
fact because here over it is empty but

381
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,350
usually I don't want a 9 wheel I want a

382
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,200
party show create a partition the

383
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,300
partitions are let's say the finest groups

384
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,580
in this sense so I add

385
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,710
to the hoover I add a suffer by

386
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,340
subject now the equivalent of the gup to the

387
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,010
subject e vien fora and what

388
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,140
before I could not keep

389
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,190
the count comes out now here it goes well

390
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,100
I see chemistry 4 of chemistry

391
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,170
the count comes out but I see the four

392
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,810
records that gave this  value 4

393
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,990
I still see them then either as a go bike

394
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,970
and it does not group you do the same job

395
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,780
but it does not group very very very useful

396
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,670
at least if you have worked with sql a bit

397
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,180
surely you have seen this problem

398
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,510
now the trick is that we have the

399
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,580
classic functions of  aggregations that

400
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,590
are it is true that those there know that already

401
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,810
can be used so in the

402
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,600
won variant of function but the beauty is that the

403
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,220
standard and follows levi has added another

404
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,350
or a lot of functions that you can

405
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,360
use in this way here there is only

406
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,120
one example ranking rehn who shows you

407
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,190
then let's say I forgot to say

408
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,200
one thing

409
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,450
besides suffering by subject I can

410
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,060
also define since now group ai

411
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,520
subject has created me  a single group

412
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,170
then where it participates in subjects

413
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,020
leaves me four records so one

414
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,700
might wonder can put them in

415
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,280
order within their group yes

416
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,429
this I do it with

417
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:10,749
now by me but it is not their by behind and

418
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:13,450
sorts all the result orders

419
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,549
internal of this partition here

420
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:19,720
so I order them by year ok so I

421
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,320
see here I have a group of physicists

422
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,059
sorted by year

423
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,249
I have not shown that year I could have shown it

424
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:30,940
and I use one of these new

425
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,039
functions that are not functions of

426
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,070
organizations but are just functions

427
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:41,169
bindo and lists this tells me the rank

428
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:43,779
translated a little so

429
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:47,039
inside the partition you see that

430
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,950
the first was the good range that

431
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,940
of the rays ics

432
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,519
then these two arrive  and they have the

433
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,919
same rank what does it mean that

434
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:59,320
they won the prize together so they

435
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,399
from buy

436
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:04,899
gir puts them on the same rank it is as

437
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:08,860
if one wins ex equo then there are

438
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,950
two seconds you see that third place is missing

439
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,740
because usually it is done  so there is

440
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,159
also the enki absence function which

441
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:22,570
would put the 3 if you want this

442
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,740
generally

443
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,720
introduces everything to granny rock new

444
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,809
possibility because you have these

445
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:31,629
partitions because they are expanded you have

446
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:37,059
functions like lead lag first and last to

447
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:39,940
which you can say if you are level  of

448
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,090
a partition record to access

449
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,549
others so you can for example

450
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:48,730
solve those of the type that if you have

451
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,149
a time syria and some value changes

452
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:54,580
you have seven records where you measure a

453
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,149
volt

454
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:58,119
you have a record where there is 1.1 volts if

455
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:01,629
you want to catch the points where it changes

456
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:03,159
this ideal

457
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:05,649
you can do with these I give you girls

458
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:07,119
here is another thing that was very

459
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,320
difficult to do in them those

460
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,870
before all this if you follow the

461
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,210
whole logical track a bit the idea is if  mpre

462
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,520
we use sequelae to avoid

463
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,560
writing loops access stable etc.

464
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,110
avoid conditionals no

465
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,940
so in this sense also the spirit

466
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,160
is a bit like functional programs

467
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,230
here comes the last point of this

468
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,410
point on my nice fred lavio

469
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,500
database was the most contested point

470
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,990
because they did not all agree no

471
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:47,030
you know that hides the endless

472
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:53,040
perennial discussion of how to organize the code of

473
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,860
an application you have a database

474
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,820
the application server to the source if you have

475
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,920
followed computer science for a few

476
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,750
years you have noticed that practically

477
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,410
oscillates at the beginning maybe you put

478
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,910
everything

479
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,830
together with the data in the back end and back

480
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,810
will sing unique

481
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,020
then at some point the era of the

482
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,270
soldiers came you put everything on the fiction you

483
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,840
need the database less important

484
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,330
then on the source there is always at the

485
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,420
discussions and let's put logic lio

486
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,980
let's put a stupid browser that

487
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,620
only displays html

488
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,410
at some point there was a tendency to

489
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,050
have the stupid font now

490
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,750
with angular  and all there is a tendency to

491
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,880
go back to the source together things

492
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,310
move what there is in my opinion to

493
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:51,150
consider move a few things to

494
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,540
the database I do not subscribe 100

495
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,470
percent to

496
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,750
the old style of having all the

497
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,670
business logic in the  database

498
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,300
would perhaps be excessive but the lola of the

499
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,420
business logic that very close to the

500
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,680
data

501
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,110
this in my opinion even today even

502
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,910
in the year 2016 it makes sense to do something in

503
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:18,260
stock wrists gers be

504
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,740
perfect four minutes

505
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,770
here I wrote to you I tasted a little

506
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,510
written a booking engine  in a flight

507
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:32,600
using pl sql clearly now it is super

508
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,820
simplified for the example but

509
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,020
generally it goes then here are some

510
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,990
ideas then if you write a booking engine it

511
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,840
is very easy for the data to be

512
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,180
your chain center then a booking engine is

513
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,160
there  different interfaces different

514
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,230
applications it is not the classic single

515
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,740
application so why not

516
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,430
put some logic directly in the

517
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,270
database

518
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,110
here it is possible to do with the

519
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,760
procedure languages  them and that of post which is

520
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:14,060
called plpgnig00014 of the old

521
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,490
bay sic dialects

522
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,640
here are the advantages or well I hide the

523
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,110
details of the db from the developer that is

524
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,020
now maybe I should go

525
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,360
ahead and the situation is this I for

526
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,870
example even a minimal booking engine

527
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,870
will already have two  tables or a table of

528
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,480
availability there is a category a date

529
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,850
and a count I only have tents here

530
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,720
because we are at the ski and or four

531
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,440
days or five places in the

532
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,480
tent category available every night but I

533
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,610
need a second table in this

534
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,850
table I put the booking  then the first

535
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,760
first light last knight and the info day

536
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,480
the linguaccia influence ok

537
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,380
let's go back here the developer of the

538
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,840
source who has programmed the forums

539
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,810
where directors need a curtain

540
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,000
etc. he doesn't need to know the

541
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,190
fact that they are two tables  relational

542
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,100
why should I know I play without it

543
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,000
doesn't concern him he just wants to send

544
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,559
book a tent from

545
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:33,980
my name is chris other very

546
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,259
great advantage  and if you have seen here we have already

547
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:38,790
put a lot of

548
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,960
constraints you see here that there are

549
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,990
some smart things like the category and

550
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,270
date of versailles unique the count

551
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,520
greater than or equal to zero

552
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,710
first light less than last night

553
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,880
etc.

554
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,340
we are sure that all  programmers

555
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,350
of all interfaces of all fronts

556
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,020
etc. always respect these there are

557
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,430
those here

558
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,980
here if you put them in the database are you sure

559
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,470
because their software breaks they

560
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,780
try to enter a data that is not there

561
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,470
let's go on this is the procedure

562
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,360
then  this would now be no

563
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,400
procedure i can't explain it in

564
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,650
all possible details but i used

565
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,180
a few things we saw before

566
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,370
now i'm obviously putting myself

567
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,700
in front of the projector first

568
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,060
you see my funky book

569
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,510
input jayson as the

570
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,760
programmer will be used  friends fontenla will use it

571
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,000
so will only do if lecture tac passes the

572
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,880
jason I pass only the data it has collected

573
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,240
from the forum and does not take care of seeing the

574
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,390
normalization  then what does it do

575
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,680
here is a nice thing or an update of

576
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,130
where I remove the count if you give them if the

577
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,110
category is the right one and the dates are

578
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,480
the right ones

579
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,130
but you did it in a strange way it is

580
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,620
done with a weezy I say with book but

581
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,690
there is this update and then I select

582
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,600
comes the phone book knight that is I

583
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,810
recall this sap select which then frees me

584
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,420


585
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,600
we say to update on

586
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,380
the interval that the interest to me however does a iter

587
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,890
ninguno return the ramin ramin pl sql rite

588
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,140
means  that one of up the twins

589
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,210
and you can also get a value to be returned

590
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,450
and here I count in a nutshell

591
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,020
how many updates it has managed to implement then I

592
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,010
count how many nights it has managed to contract

593
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,920
down the comparison with what should

594
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,280
have been last minute first here I have made

595
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,870
this abbreviation  so as not to

596
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:58,790
always write the access string to the jayson and

597
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:03,060
if they do not look I say look I did not

598
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,270
have all the available notes it could

599
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,360
also be the tent that was no longer there

600
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,800
the children I enter the booking auction at

601
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,260
the c  dare beautiful is that if it fails at

602
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,180
any time if for example of the

603
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,880
seven nights I book the third note

604
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,390
there is no longer the count I would go

605
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:27,270
below zero then

606
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,880
next action is automatically launched everything I

607
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,670
touched and roll back and I return to the promoter

608
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:36,300
mine  an error so I don't

609
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,930
even have to be careful to say oops I

610
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,350
have to do the big in of a transaction I have to

611
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,000
check every single querrey do it

612
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,520
with the beckett it's all automatic if at

613
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,170
any point it fails at the end there are

614
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,510
already all blind constraints there was already

615
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,390
everything so  I have done here only this

616
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,390
special cech that all the updates have been

617
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:04,020
successful and then I enter the

618
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,880
end this is the result

619
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,970
I select book and it returns me the

620
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,410
serial that created the high incremental

621
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,900
ok I do not say to do the whole world like this

622
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,360
but  this is definitely an approach

623
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,280
where I challenge anyone to program it

624
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,910
completely on the mid tier with this

625
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,680
number of lines with all the controls

626
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,250
it makes

627
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:40,460
and gems  and now I finish those who knew

628
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,690
this here nerd of find to one

629
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,380
person only this is the straight

630
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,170
sql st nardò they can do a little everyone you can

631
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,500
define procedures and set them

632
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,650
with as does linux with set of eat ie

633
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:02,390
dc the procedure is performed with the

634
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,450
permissions of those who defined the procedure

635
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:10,430
not of those who are executing it so if

636
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:15,080
I follow it as a ciccio user I can

637
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,740
book and to my second tent but

638
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,050
if I ice it and try to do it delete from

639
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,630
tells me notes friends of nike because tsi

640
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,210
ciccio  you are not the user to one of the

641
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,440
database that chris then to set with

642
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,800
some fantastic databases then create

643
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,050
a procedure interface and

644
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,450
your web user are allowed to execute

645
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,760
these procedures

646
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,010
if in any way 1 hole the myth the

647
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,280
tir with the user  which has fails to

648
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,960
manipulate the database even if the

649
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,210
various parameters are low ex cetera fails to

650
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,340
manipulate the data had not through

651
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,120
the functions

652
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,680
here and with this I conclude
