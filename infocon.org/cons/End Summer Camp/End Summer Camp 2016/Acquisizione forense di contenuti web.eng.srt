00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
hello everyone I am marco this is a

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,270
talk on the forensic acquisition of

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,420
web content

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,280
I work in synaptic which is a company

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,710
that deals with digital forensic and

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,020
incident response

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,670
exclusively first of all because

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,580
because we need to be able to acquire

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,939
web evidence or evidence from the internet or evidence  of the

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,000
cloud in a certain way

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,529
some statistics because

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,399
simply the cases that require

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,910
this activity are constantly increasing

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,489
we speak for example of defamation

15
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:42,750
all these statistics are in

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,940
the European community not in Italy

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,920
so we see increasing statistics of

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,950
online defamation of hype year

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,879
english  online ment of illegal count

20
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,649
we talk about child pornography this a

21
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,600
surge of 20 percent per year

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,180
just to say more all the other

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,070
types

24
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,769
but not only do not rely only on

25
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,299
statistics we reason on two things

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,970
first of all the pervasiveness of new

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,040
technologies now new technologies

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,240
are used to  any

29
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,869
activity and it is nothing new to tell you  or but

30
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,180
what does this mean that many crimes

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,990
that he deprives were committed in reality

32
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,619
forgiven now they are instead committed

33
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,979
in virtual reality so

34
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,020
defamation is increasingly

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,329
online defamation stalking although it

36
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,560
absolutely exists continue to exist

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,740
in reality is increasingly led

38
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,150
to stalking  online

39
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,930
and so on then crimes are

40
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,990
moving into the digital digital world in

41
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,399
addition we have the damn false

42
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,369
sense of anonymity and distance that

43
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,070
we feel when we use a

44
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,909
digital device

45
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,250
so if I come out of a restaurant but

46
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,979
help and I would never dream of saying

47
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:06,180
damn  the restaurateurs that you can

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,848
die on tripadvisor maybe I didn't

49
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,889
like the first one immediately I go to

50
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,540
write the worst things is that of

51
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,870
30 defamation in the same way

52
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,170
many attitudes that we hold on

53
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,659
social networks fortunately we will not keep them

54
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:25,060
in real life but they

55
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,480
can give rise to  to

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,859
criminal proceedings

57
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:32,680
therefore we have absolut  the

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,220
need to be able to acquire

59
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,470
online evidence in a certain and secure way from a

60
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:47,170
multitude of different services and sources what is

61
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,030
the problem how

62
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,109
evidence is currently collected let's not talk about

63
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:54,459
what the technical consultants

64
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:56,980
who do this for their job do let

65
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,840
's talk about most  of lawyers

66
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,379
or most of other

67
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:04,569
IT consultants who are called to

68
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:07,829
help lawyer in this activity

69
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:10,000
unfortunately most of the

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,939
time we proceed with mere printing or in the

71
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,919
most advanced case of use of

72
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,840
technology saving

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,989
the desktop screenshot what problem do

74
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,370
they have  type of evidence is

75
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,810
trivially they are easily controllable

76
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,530
are subject to the possible presence of

77
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,470
malware on the computer used but we are

78
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,959
already in more advanced cases than the

79
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,239
first of that is to be easily

80
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,739
countered finally even human error

81
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,690
this does not involve particular

82
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,389
problems until the moment in which it is

83
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:50,829
arrives in the classroom and in the meantime

84
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,840
the original has been deleted

85
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,359
at this point the proof that we have

86
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:59,409
produced badly is obviously

87
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,299
rejected because it has no

88
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:03,310
characteristic of conformity to the

89
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,040
original we cannot rely on

90
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,409
which one a simple print to prove

91
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:10,329
the existence of a past web element

92
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,849
I do not say  which is always rejected

93
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:16,539
because even from the counterpart sometimes

94
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:18,608
there is no knowledge of what you can

95
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,500
object to what not but with the

96
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,080
ever greater presence of

97
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,510
trained technical consultants you find yourself on

98
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,750
the other side of ready people who try

99
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,310
to dismantle an acquisition stumbles upon  in

100
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,790
this way how to proceed so

101
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,940
unfortunately it is trivial but we cannot

102
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,550
proceed as in the other areas of

103
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,350
digital forensics we do not have a hard

104
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,850
disk to detach from the one garan red

105
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,060
blocker bluff and still does not do this but

106
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,380
sooner or later when they will put their

107
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,800
legs and arms  it will do this too and

108
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,820
so we have to look for a procedure the

109
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,710
main question is which procedure to

110
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,640
follow  and I would overturn the question a little

111
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,130
more than give you a series of

112
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,710
steps to follow let's

113
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,820
think about what we need

114
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,590
we can think about three types of

115
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,380
elements that make up a web acquisition

116
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,570


117
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,730
we have an environment used for

118
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:24,340
the acquisition the user the user the

119
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,510
one  that performs the acquisition and the

120
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,120
connection between the

121
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,360
acquisition environment and the web server to say

122
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,190
one to take a remote example where

123
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,120
the contents are hosted

124
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,800
we must ensure that all

125
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,729
these three elements do not present

126
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:50,470
problems

127
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,380
if we can guarantee that the  '

128
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,060
used environment is suitable that the operator

129
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,780
has not done something wrong and that

130
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,940
the connectivity between the environment and

131
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,240
the original element is intact then

132
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,110
we have obtained a suitable web acquisition

133
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,450
done well that proves the existence

134
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,700
of a given element even in the  case

135
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,020
later in that element is

136
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,600
deleted

137
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,910
how can we get these three

138
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,280
elements

139
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,570
here we can enter a little more in

140
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,000
m  erit of some procedures that can

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,580
be delivered there is no

142
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,790
100% optimal and perfect solution to

143
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,970
be followed slavishly there

144
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,430
are no regulations there is no international procedure

145
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,550
accepted so we have to

146
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,700
think about the previous elements and

147
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,090
ask ourselves if we are respecting these

148
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,450
requests

149
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,680
we say that that  that it may be

150
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,430
advisable to start from a

151
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,590
standard environment if we have to certify the

152
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,500
mind used for the acquisition the

153
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,050
best thing maybe starting from a

154
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,650
live distribution maybe linux

155
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,510
maybe designed for the for the environment the

156
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,300
forensics for the forensic activity

157
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,400
we are lucky  that I have in my

158
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,810
home that I often see using

159
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,190
for example cali linux which has more or less

160
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,660
the same tools to do

161
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,270
the web acquisition and therefore nothing prevents

162
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,100
you from using your

163
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,990
live distribution of which you are fond of

164
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,780
this guarantees that the  the environment on which

165
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,180
we start is identical it conforms to a

166
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,040
certain standard so if I start def  t

167
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,160
live

168
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,850
I know it is not there are not a series

169
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,550
of malware that could instead have the

170
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,290
computer of the lawyer's office that

171
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,810
is used for this activity and

172
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,930
we must not try too hard to

173
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,300
prove the opposite because we start from

174
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,720
a very clear situation already in this one

175
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,230
so

176
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:15,160
we try to certify the

177
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,170
use environment used for

178
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,110
the acquisition at this point we

179
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,750
must guarantee both that the operator

180
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,980
does not carry out any activity aimed at

181
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,130
modifying the elements that are

182
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,400
downloaded and guarantee that the

183
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,929
network connection between the

184
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:39,469
acquisition environment and the internet is real

185
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,380
here are listed some of the commands that

186
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,959
can be launched it is

187
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,980
absolutely not an exhaustive list

188
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,510
there can be better and what is the

189
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,350
concept we must try to work

190
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,000
on the three elements we have said

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,860
so for example surely something

192
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,810
that cannot  missing is a

193
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,660
video recording of the entire activity a

194
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,170
complete traffic dump  or network a series

195
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,500
of system calls that can be

196
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,300
a pt cat that can be a visit to

197
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,750
some sites with them exact some sites

198
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,990
rather complicated to forge

199
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,740
some tris ruth some wiz etc

200
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,110
etc etc etc any software you

201
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,470
want to install you can use it if

202
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,930
already present  on david maybe downloaded

203
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,640
a second version for example you

204
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,610
have to do an exit you can want to download on the

205
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,080
fly not only use the

206
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,640
system commands but download a package that

207
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,459
guarantee a second chance to

208
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:49,350
do to demonstrate that the software

209
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,600
used to calculate you has not been

210
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,820
modified to  hoc to give

211
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,500
a certain ash as a result a little

212
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,700
advice in the final part that is more

213
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,450
operational than technical profiling

214
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,360
very often when it comes if it tries to

215
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,630
acquire a single web element that

216
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,510
could be the classic

217
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:20,579
comprehensive facebook comment very often it is

218
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,240
limited to simple comment  instead no

219
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,980
try to go further try to do

220
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,110
a providing of that person who

221
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,089
posted the comment look at other

222
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,520
comments to the fact that others the vote

223
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,390
posted because this is because if you

224
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,459
simply acquire that comment

225
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,399
you undoubtedly can prove that

226
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,620
that comment existed even if it is

227
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,820
deleted

228
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,980
but what's the problem once  that

229
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,290


230
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,600
a procedure is opened to try to

231
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,600
understand who is the author of that comment

232
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,490
how to do it proceed by requesting

233
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,949
to facebook for association with

234
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:03,320
ip addresses after which ip addresses are given

235
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,019
to the manager to understand

236
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:09,319
which telephone user was concerned  that

237
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:12,110
facebook ip address for example for

238
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,930
defamation cases does not respond so the

239
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,139
chain is already blocked or when a

240
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:19,850
home arrives a computer that is used by a

241
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,310
family is already there there is a doubt about who

242
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,759
has been within the miles

243
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:29,060
through profiling  and instead we have a

244
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,990
case in Italy

245
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,759
more than one but one was quite

246
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,819
emblematic of a judge who

247
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,699
followed one  series of offensive comments on

248
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:42,860
facebook directly condemned

249
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,470
the person corresponding to the name and

250
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,509
surname of the facebook account because

251
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:48,920
because we know he did a

252
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,110
profiling activity so it was seen that that

253
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,630
account could not not belong to

254
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,819
that person because it was used

255
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:58,120
over the years with  the name the surname

256
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,670
publishing his personal photos was

257
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,490
used shortly before to send other

258
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,970
comments to other friends of his shortly after

259
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,670
for other personal activities

260
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:16,519
so it was not plausible or it was

261
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,470
implausible that in that while he

262
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,139
was hacked I used by a

263
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:23,899
third person and  above all the author

264
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:26,690
has never retracted the final comment ivo

265
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,500
did not say ah sorry this

266
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,819
comment was posted by another person

267
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,370
so the judge in question

268
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,589
skipped all the part of let's call it a

269
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,920
digital investigation to get to the

270
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,470
identity of the person and the associated  to

271
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,370
that account

272
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,009
you can be you can agree or

273
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:50,540
disagree with that  the sentence is clear

274
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,899
but if you are trying to save it is

275
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,360
the web element you do profiling because

276
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,279
the investigation could greatly help

277
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,540
these this technique this procedure has

278
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,770
already been described in a men bookies

279
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,260
made a few years ago and used and

280
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,980
improved by various technical consultants

281
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,740
in italy then everyone uses his

282
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,800
personal thing that is a

283
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,780
very good technical consultant who prefers to use a

284
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,330
virtual machine with windows instantiated

285
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,140
on amazon

286
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,160
there are those who prefer to use dept but

287
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,480
all agree in trying to

288
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,220
guarantee those three elements

289
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,700
once those three elements are  guaranteed

290
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,550
the acquisition has been done in a

291
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,690
workmanlike manner let's say as much as possible there is

292
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,160
a whole series of existing legislation and

293
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,010
jurisprudence and scientific papers on

294
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,460
this topic

295
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,430
nobody puts an end to it nobody

296
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,950
writes a procedure well done but if

297
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,720
you want to follow it  a procedure of your own but which

298
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,230
respects these characteristics, you can

299
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,800
still mention that you have followed

300
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,120
everything p  revised from a series

301
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,950
of literature of

302
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,630
jurisprudence of doctrine

303
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,260
etcetera etcetera

304
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,980
what is a possible solution

305
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,329
what is a possible

306
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,220
the solutions and here we move to a

307
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,369
commercial solution is not the only one

308
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:39,189
not the best solution in the world

309
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:42,129
there are several  this is a

310
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:46,869
different idea an idea is to remove an

311
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:53,279
element said this if we take

312
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,199
these three elements and in particular

313
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,089
the acquisition environment and

314
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,209
connectivity and move them elsewhere we

315
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:04,149
remove them from the user's availability

316
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:07,689
we have much less things  to be demonstrated if

317
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:10,569
we move the entire acquisition environment to the

318
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:12,730
cloud, make it a

319
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,639
service and the user connects

320
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:21,279
to the acquisition environment through

321
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,989
its connectivity an

322
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:26,350
acquisition goal in which he does not have administrative privileges,

323
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,720
we solve a whole

324
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:36,910
series of  problems this solution has

325
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,610
been rendered a service that is sold

326
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,139
program let's leave the commercial part alone

327
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:45,429
and go back to  instead of what

328
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:49,749
problems this could run

329
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:53,769
into if we instead carry out a

330
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,319
manual procedure or the one followed

331
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:58,869
for example by starting or looking for

332
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:03,629
making a video of the acquisition

333
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:06,759
recording all the network traffic

334
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,089
etc.

335
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:12,189


336
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:13,929


337
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,790
etc.  the whole acquisition environment

338
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,179
is quite difficult

339
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:23,110
once we work on david started

340
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,470
cali started to be able to show that

341
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,839
the environment we are using is

342
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:32,709
really the lindy cali live

343
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:34,709
we downloaded and it is not a

344
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:38,579
previously modified live

345
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,559
of the attempts to do so

346
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:44,740
but the final point has not been set to say I could

347
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,720
work on a suitably

348
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,949
modified cali so that all traffic

349
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:52,809
to the internet works normally

350
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:56,259
except when I go to look for a certain

351
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,509
facebook profile and mary sets up a

352
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:01,119
modified comment to something else

353
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:04,179
or a  aisha function such that it

354
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:07,779
modifies it gives me a ha  sh different so

355
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:09,849
that I can later modify

356
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:13,319
the downloaded file

357
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,640
the other weak point is the connectivity

358
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,929
the connection

359
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:21,909
in the sense if I work on the

360
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:26,859
live environment that connects to the internet it is

361
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,380
similarly difficult to prove that

362
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,090
there is not between my environment

363
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,820
acquisition in the web server that publishes

364
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,620
the element with some type

365
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,649
of network device that alters the

366
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:44,320
content part of the commands that are

367
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,260
launched that are in the previous list are

368
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,610
used precisely to try to

369
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,529
demonstrate that the environment has not been

370
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:53,500
modified or that the  connectivity is

371
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,929
the real one

372
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:57,580
there is nothing in between that is

373
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,570
modifying the element but there is not 100

374
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,960
percent security right now

375
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,869
well

376
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:15,509
to arrive on time so we are also a

377
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:18,259
few minutes early if you want

378
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:24,379
some questions something else please

379
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,389
points that perhaps derive

380
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:33,359
from different experience the first is to

381
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,190
show the environment it is not

382
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,289
objectively difficult to me it does not seem difficult

383
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:40,320
that so much that the  n drops or what you

384
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,419
are all open source environments so

385
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,039
if I take an environment we stay a

386
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:48,470
vm and together with the deposit test sources

387
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,879
also the virtual machine is

388
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,679
available from the counterpart that can

389
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,330
do what the hell he wants above

390
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,330
went to  check it out but i'll

391
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,460
answer this in the end both yes

392
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,070
but i'll give you the overview ok and the

393
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,869
network part is true i agree it

394
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:05,940
could be tam per but you never have

395
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,429
the chance to totally verify it

396
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:10,859
because you will never have a dark fiber that

397
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,019
it goes from you to the website so in

398
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,909
any case you manage it and it will always be

399
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:16,739
difficult to prove it

400
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,320
third the fact of saying I delete the

401
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,129
user my connectivity to use a

402
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:26,279
cloud service makes me shiver

403
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,979
because I say at least as if I give you a

404
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:30,419
vm  with an open software

405
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,729
you can demonstrate what you want or later

406
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:35,009
easy counter-proof if I take all the

407
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,989
thing and I slam it in the cloud and I get a

408
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:39,239
black box I have also finished being able to

409
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:41,070
demonstrate those q  ufour things I was

410
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,179
able to do ok then the last part I

411
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,220
don't comment on it because I don't want to do

412
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,950
the commercial sales part it was the

413
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,580
first part instead overcoming the network

414
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,340
we agree is perhaps the most

415
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,539
insurmountable obstacle

416
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,759
the part relating to demonstrating

417
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,379
the  environment used is difficult because

418
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:05,580
undoubtedly it would be the best thing to

419
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,950
say I used this if I

420
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,359
can do it in contradiction it is

421
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,129
peaceful I use all open

422
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:13,820
source environments in contradiction we are fine

423
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,009
but if I do it pre-contradictory

424
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:20,429
as always happens in these cases as I

425
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:23,180
show that  what I have delivered

426
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,770
is what is used I do not say that it is

427
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,840
impossible but I have to use a whole

428
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,490
series of tricks that are a bit

429
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,920
complicated compared to the simple start

430
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,780
face in the package and I deliver

431
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,160


432
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:22,850
certainly certainly very well no problem

433
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,199
no one does not exclude the  other

434
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:48,830
I wanted to ask but in normal and other

435
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,490
forensic environments not necessarily

436
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,770
in the world of info  rmatica there will be the exact

437
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,960
same problem of validating

438
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,720
the recovery environment as then I

439
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,730
'm wrong it is a different case because in

440
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,280
all or at least in most of the

441
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,140
other sectors of digital forensics I

442
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,270
proceed immediately with the so-called

443
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,820
forensic copy is that the moment in which

444
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,760
I  crystallize i meant just in a

445
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,340
world other than digital freesia for

446
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,180
example he entered the house i have to

447
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:27,030
acquire fingerprints on the floor inquire on the

448
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,390
window i say to say yes how do i

449
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,840
validate the environment be the judge

450
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,130
how can i be sure that the technician has

451
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,970
done everything correctly  challenge

452
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,500
in part he trusts but in part those

453
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,180
activities are carried out by the

454
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,500
judicial police and this all this is

455
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,510
absolutely not a problem for the

456
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,800
judicial police because the

457
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,620
judicial police has enormous power in

458
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,700
Italy or to say what

459
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,700
the judicial police write is true until  a

460
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,050
false complaint then any

461
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,720
investigator can simply say  I

462
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,990
saw the facebook profile

463
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,650
corresponded there was this

464
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,660
defamatory message I do the press that

465
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,600
is worth more than anything else

466
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,360
technically done because it is a legal power

467
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,120
theoretically even lawyers could do it

468
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,100
for a few years because they have

469
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,230
defensive investigations that with

470
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,530
really strong powers  however it is very

471
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,200
dangerous and therefore often lawyers

472
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,020
do not go that far especially

473
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,750
in parts that they do not know exactly

474
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:47,700
because they risk a lot it could be

475
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,820
an activity done by a notary instead

476
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,370
notaries refuse to varlam so

477
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,960
resolved at least most I know of

478
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,280
some  who did it in the most

479
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,809
part they refuse

480
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:12,480
then it is what I was told by the

481
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,570
notary is that this activity would produce

482
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,659
a proof in this way the notary

483
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:21,210
would replace the judge who is

484
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,580
the only element that can decide what is

485
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,380
proof and  no and therefore there would be a

486
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,299
small clash of competence and therefore they

487
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:32,370
prefer not to do it this is what it is

488
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,320
and I was told I am not a notary

489
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:47,730
so I just report it is based

490
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,530
on his signature throughout the procedure

491
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,980
goes so much so from a

492
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,900
let's say legal point of view and you have sat

493
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,419
paralyzed because because what is authentic

494
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:01,650
is the signature and therefore  no one tries to

495
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,710
go against a notary who, however, from the

496
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,600
point of view of the procedure to

497
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:13,860
cheat beautifully from is however what

498
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,770
tends to be their name and who do not

499
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,539
know how to treat this thing

500
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,789
differently from a piece of paper their

501
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:23,220
procedure of saying but we give them the  what

502
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,250


503
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,049
is it

504
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:56,559


505
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,500


506
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,220


507
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,100


508
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,850


509
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,260


510
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,350
?  site that was gone that there was

511
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,919
a defamatory comment in which a

512
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,909
lover

513
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:21,909
alice found it legal that

514
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:24,159
the nonprofit controlled organization

515
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,889
does not know by whom  do not check

516
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:29,440
anyone can acquire it as evidence

517
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,169
sparked a debate among me some of

518
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:34,330
my friends wanted to know your opinion

519
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,440
well then myself in some

520
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,679
proceedings

521
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,169
we used the web archive to

522
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:47,769
try to prove our point the

523
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:49,960
problem is that we try to  use every

524
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,600
available tool so then it is up to the

525
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,279
judge to decide whether a

526
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,760
reliable source or not also depends on the

527
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,529
entity of the procedure given

528
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:04,779
what we are talking about so I do

529
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:08,409
not know exactly what the

530
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:10,720
alleged offense was and therefore it could

531
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,919
actually be particular for

532
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:19,419
those who find themselves  investigated to ensure that the

533
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:21,880
tests were carried out years earlier

534
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,490
by an automated structure on which

535
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,429
perhaps there is no control aimed

536
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:29,649
precisely at demonstrating that there is no

537
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:33,710
malicious intervention so yes

538
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,470
let's say that if I were it depends on which

539
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,899
side I am certain unfortunately  our

540
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:41,690
work however there weren't things are

541
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,490
opinions about certain things we are are

542
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,779
opinions  on things there is the

543
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:46,610
fixed point in which whatever our

544
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:50,419
part is we are realistic and on such a

545
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,270
thing there are opinions so we

546
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,700
can debate how we debate among ourselves

547
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,570
outside the legal environment

548
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,570
thanks

549
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,549
remember that in Italy the  judge

550
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,070
can take on evidence or reject

551
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,559
any kind of evidence

552
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,850
the judge can take the

553
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,380
printed page and decide the

554
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,480
absolute truth that the judge can take the

555
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,100
smoking gun with your

556
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,460
fingerprint and decide that

557
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,640
the ultimate power of anything is not proof  it is up

558
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,529
to the judge then obviously he has to

559
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:27,559
answer for it within certain limits but however

560
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:30,760
the ultimate power is of the judge in Italy

561
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,260
there are already procedures that

562
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,730
can be written in a program in a

563
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,100
software in a machine for which it can

564
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,049
verify the evidence and already say about it

565
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:42,080
this test is correct or not in what

566
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,740
sense

567
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,450
in the sense that whoever is gathering the

568
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,980
evidence can be done by a person

569
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,169
or by the machine using  or which as such

570
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:49,520
a procedure then

571
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,429
automating for example in delphi

572
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:53,960
there may be beyond the procedure to

573
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,940
take them if there is a way to create

574
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,770
another machine instead a software

575
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,659
we are automated that can

576
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:02,510
verify them later if it

577
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,010
already exists but where the  new quotes or google

578
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,809
and the machine says yes this test

579
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:07,070
is correct

580
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,840
no it is an activity of verifying

581
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,490
any proof of a

582
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,649
web acquisition that has perhaps been modified is

583
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:17,000
rather complicated for now that I

584
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,570
know requires human intervention to

585
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:23,510
load the  the network traffic dump

586
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,309
go to check a whole series of

587
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:27,140
things to try to understand if there has been

588
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,440
a camper in I do not think of an

589
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,549
automatic procedure

590
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:35,720
but if someone in the classroom knows if there is a

591
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,460
slope I know I know one  what I

592
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,440
do not know if still used is called tls

593
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,540
notari that goes first to sign

594
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,720
the data save the page

595
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,510
where to sign with the

596
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,570
site certificate and therefore at least if not  I know I am

597
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,670
discovering it insert in any case I would

598
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:58,110
insert it inside the attempt to

599
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,140
certify that is as a tool inside

600
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,990
rather than the name of the solution tool

601
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,970
if it goes to what I think it does

602
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,470
please trivial example

603
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,710
I had case in which there were two partners

604
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,660
who quarreled and set

605
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,060
up plissé did not go to another

606
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,280
company when those of the first

607
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,290
company went to the site of the second

608
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,060
and there was a page where they were

609
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,100
filled with insults and then they did

610
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,800
report however when you go to

611
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,390
acquire from  a third machine that didn't

612
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,830
come from the first company was a

613
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,460
perfect perfect website so what

614
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,960
happens that at that moment there you can

615
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,640
certify what you want but the

616
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,320
website that answers you depending on who the

617
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,480
heck 6 so the forgery of

618
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,280
a web proof can  be done so

619
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,010
many levels and automating it

620
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,570
doesn't make the slightest sense because it could

621
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,040
even be the website itself

622
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,240
that is doing the

623
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,190
bastard from the start  of the chain so it is

624
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,590
really difficult to be able to say yes

625
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,840
this has happened you can have a tour that

626
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,700
says barda since I started with

627
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,950
this ip at this moment

628
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,230
these things have happened I give you the video I

629
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,790
give you the dump which then for example on

630
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,290
facebook you do not need  a tube because it is so

631
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,870
encrypted but at least you put them in front of

632
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,940
a series a pile the elements that says

633
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,270
ok it is plausible that it is so but I say

634
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,710
then you find situations like the

635
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,900
one I found that was very

636
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,210
funny but it makes you understand web to

637
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,800
respond differently to  depending on who

638
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,780
you are you can't do anything

639
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:38,550
else it depends on it is defamation if you have

640
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,170
more than one person responsible for the content

641
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,470
so even if the training was not

642
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,090
towards the company but maybe it was towards one

643
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,710
of the employees of one of the two fingers and in

644
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,510
any case of  training even if it is not

645
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,750
public all over the world

646
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:55,020
as if I wrote on the inside of

647
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,980
this

648
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,870
let's say that it is a house a

649
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,670
defamatory writing inside the house if

650
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,309
the people who enter anyway

651
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:05,510
see it and it is not pleasant

652
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,020
now instead the technical procedure to

653
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,280
acquire the evidence in general

654
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,780
technical procedure to acquire a site

655
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,880
and certify that it is more or less what

656
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
we have that we have described then

657
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,179
starting from a distribution from a

658
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:38,150
distribution  live yes yes

659
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:43,830
here it is to start a desktop

660
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,450
recording video recording software

661
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,840


662
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,880
even better would be

663
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,760
even a second

664
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,080
analog video recording pointing

665
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,000
to the desktop but here in practically

666
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,040
a paranoid activity plus any

667
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,410
element that can help that comes

668
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,690
in  mind do it because it is better to have

669
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:12,270
10 rather than 5 for example this

670
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,100
case the complete dump is performed with

671
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,309
white shark the

672
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:20,480
network connection is started after firefox is started

673
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,730
a list of the

674
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:27,240
system hardware of the network configuration is performed a

675
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,260
ruth arp restrut  at a couple of sites an

676
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,660
apt get update some leo exact time sites

677
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:42,860
ne typical fruit juice of the profiling site

678
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,070


679
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,650
at this point normal capture of

680
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,050
screenshots saving in html etcetera

681
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,220
etcetera

682
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,860
and in the end everything comes out and

683
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,160
timestamp on the former calculated of a couple

684
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,200
of other things that are not there now

685
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,780
I see probably it was made to

686
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,950
re-enter the

687
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,159
in the slide, however, more picene and

688
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,019
better if you have to install a software

689
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:11,070
just maybe you keep it from bottles

690
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,810
or visit the site etcetera

691
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,909
etcetera

692
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:16,800
possibly use proxy sites

693
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,429
inside in order to demonstrate that if

694
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,859
perhaps a simple website is not lesbian

695
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,800
that you can access  directly is

696
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,629
part by amassing sun sun proxes web and

697
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:32,699
going to the site through the web proxy

698
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:35,879
etcetera etcetera any activity that

699
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:38,730
comes to mind so that if

700
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,159
you were the counterparty to eliminate a

701
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,389
doubt

702
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,839
do it

703
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,590
no

704
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,890
not only

705
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,490
no because as soon as it has been

706
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:16,090
realized there are cases in  which

707
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,110
profiling allowed to disassemble that

708
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:25,720
the said fact of the crime was not  the

709
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,250
user's fault

710
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,720
then personally happened to us no

711
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,700
there are cases in which it was not

712
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,380
possible to reach the physical person

713
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,700
despite having a lot of

714
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:44,230
digital information let's say to a couple

715
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,810
of reference instead a couple of cases

716
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,810
that have happened to a couple of companies

717
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,300
Italian notes that always go digital

718
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,760
forensics in which instead of

719
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,420
profiling they have shown that he was a

720
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,320
user created specifically to

721
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,630
import to do those activities to

722
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,720
try to frame another person

723
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,820
well

724
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,390
I thank you all
