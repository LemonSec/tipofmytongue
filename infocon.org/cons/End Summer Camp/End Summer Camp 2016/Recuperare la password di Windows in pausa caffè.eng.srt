1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
in the morning a quick talk my name is

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,790
always tirano that of last night and

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,670
I always deal with forensics today

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,300
we take a nice little thing that

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,759
we use in forensics to

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,640
chat for a moment and talk about a

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,320
very interesting program that wants

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,570
activities that a program to do

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,869
the  'analysis of the memory the

10
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,920
information roads of the ram memory of

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,840
any type of computer

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,510
today we speak in particular of a windows pc

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,230


14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,930
because the talk was born as a game of

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,960
recovering the password of the colleague who

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,950
works with you on a server or you

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,059
see them who has  the pc the pc up reality of

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,489
making a dump of the physical memory

19
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,750
the purpose which from what this talk comes from

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,120
until several years ago when

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,910
the seizures were done the first thing

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,890
you did you took the computer and if

23
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,500
you turned it off a correct mode or

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,960
less but the idea was to turn off the

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,830
computer

26
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,200
could be a pc or a mac or any

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,270
other device

28
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,250
the current idea as attention in

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,330
me  memory we have a lot of information

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,759
that can be very useful to be able to

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,930
perform an analysis make a profile and

32
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,360
then listen to the evidence that you can

33
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,670
use in the area that interests you

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,369
then the idea is to

35
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,009
always perform a memory dump before

36
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,820
turn off the server or the computer today

37
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,280
what we will do I will show you that with

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,549
a usb key and a small program it

39
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:48,750
was the usb key

40
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,330
if you

41
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,580
have the possibility to have

42
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:58,250
physical access to the server in question or to the pc

43
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,580
you can safely take me away

44
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,570
you can do it  even the motorbikes but the

45
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,550
game this morning is my

46
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,770
colleague left the pc on and

47
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,150
pc administrator

48
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,670
I do nothing but steal the mistakes

49
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,530
going the memory and recover his

50
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,170
password and the user what do you need

51
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,080
then you need precisely  of a

52
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,780
target and of course you must be

53
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,670
someone who has arrogated to this

54
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,450
target

55
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,950
ok you only need a usb stick with

56
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,440
a small program inside to do the d  ump and

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,750
then you need a station the

58
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,209
so-called forensic station where among the

59
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:39,890
various tours you have interned there is also

60
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,140
subscribed screws sick is an excellent

61
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,830
very modular open source product with

62
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,220
different plugins and we are going to save one

63
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,410
of the most interesting plugins that has been

64
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,260
developed  this morning which basically allows you

65
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,000
to recover the

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,250
windows user password but this is

67
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,060
only one millionth of information

68
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,980
that can be stored in the memory there

69
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,900
are many others and many more

70
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,820
interesting those that interest

71
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,840
us say in the forensic field are the

72
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,880
memory keys that  they are used

73
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,160
to encrypt the disk we are talking about

74
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,060
bitlocker edict clips with true crypt

75
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,980
if we can safely recover

76
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,780
the password

77
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,140
the key that there is memory with with big

78
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,750
block on windows ten they say yes I

79
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,519
have made a couple of attempts still not

80
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,040
there  I managed, however, it says that you

81
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,380
can recover the b blog key

82
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,230
to be able to decrypt the file system

83
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,530
that portable and

84
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,000
especially corporate devices can be very

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,530
como

86
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,260
then let's go on these are I

87
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,760
tried to give him as much information as

88
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,470
possible on the slides in such a way

89
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,480
that if someone wants to do this

90
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,100
on his own at home after done

91
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,550
in that mind then I put

92
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,470
the versions of the various products that I

93
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,720
used and I have also put

94
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,750
inside the link where

95
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,840
you can download what can be useful then the

96
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,640
most beautiful tool in the world that ft

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,530
capri manager knight and the tool

98
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,550
that all experts and

99
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,220
non-experts know  digital forensics because

100
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,899
a tool that allows you to do

101
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,350
multiple operations

102
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,540
the characteristic of the light version

103
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,190
lies in the fact that it can be inserted

104
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,500
the body has a usb key and does not

105
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,270
need to be installed there is also of

106
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,010
course the version that can be installed

107
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,300
unless it is a tool that everyone  who supports

108
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,890
forensics who knows and uses as

109
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,090
usual

110
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,960
after which there is volatility version 25

111
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,560
that gives  a little bit out I

112
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,360
used my forensic station that a mac or

113
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,540
sx you can install it also

114
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,160
inside another linux machine

115
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,110
you can also use the

116
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,700
standard versions and the on

117
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,640
under microsoft but I don't recommend it

118
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,980
because basically they are  of

119
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,540
the standard and long versions with

120
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,720
internal jean michel plugins you cannot

121
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,220
increase or potential

122
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,669
let's say the capabilities and then also nice every now and then to

123
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:14,280
get there and install

124
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,290
even on operating systems that are not

125
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,960
expressly microsoft

126
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,669
in particular I need a plugin

127
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:23,940
we have inserted inside the  talk the

128
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,020
mimic link where you can download it

129
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,260
substantially stuck in the belly of

130
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,010
birds that you need substantially

131
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,530
a quarter of an hour perhaps even less

132
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,780
the joke is also convenient in the

133
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,790
business environment in the sense that you connect to the

134
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,200
server where maybe there are three or four

135
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,060
colleagues who are working  you

136
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,770
damage memory and basically you

137
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,320
go to recover the passwords of

138
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,370
your colleagues

139
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,930
a  now this is not an instigation to

140
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,850
do this kind of activity

141
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,830
but know that in any case one thing that

142
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,460
can be done but inside you can

143
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,080
listen to other information so

144
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,780
this only in quotes a game

145
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,110
a demo

146
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,069
the program that if someone knows the

147
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,139
ft keys substantially  very simple

148
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,019
you insert the usb key once

149
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:17,599
it is recognized that speaking of

150
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,499
a windows system

151
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:21,619
click on the executable there is a

152
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:23,479
very simple key that says ok famille dame

153
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,849
of memory even here in the

154
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,129
forensic field it is not that you are making a

155
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:30,439
position that  it does not dirty

156
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,659
anything because once you have the

157
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,819
program inside the

158
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:37,669
microsoft system you do nothing but load

159
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:40,939
a program in foreign quotation marks into memory

160
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,860
then go and break the

161
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,259
memory when you then do the dam of the

162
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:48,379
memory with this mode also go

163
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,199
and fetch  that piece of memory

164
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,539
used by this software so

165
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,119
know that here you are always dirtying

166
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:58,939
the e  However, in this case it is not a

167
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:01,269
big problem

168
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,779
remember a very important thing

169
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:05,360
when you play these games where

170
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,339
everything must be prepared because you have 15

171
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:09,110
minutes of time 15 used a

172
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,179
stick a usb stick must be

173
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:14,329
formatted not in fat32 ntfs because

174
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:15,829
because the damage  of memory are

175
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:19,369
usually if you start from 4 8 16 and 32 ok

176
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:22,429
this only to make you understand that if

177
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:24,649
you have to play this game someone

178
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:26,389
must be prepared on all the

179
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:28,909
details as usually in forensics

180
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:33,139
is done once you launch a

181
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,710
hard tuning from the memory.

182
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,330
counter that gives you an idea of the

183
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,930
amount of memory it is printing

184
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,090
basically to make 8gb takes

185
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,850
less than ten minutes so you

186
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,380
need about ten minutes to

187
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,080
do it per action once you

188
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,940
have a deal the memory is good there

189
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,170
are  other systems

190
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,590
a nice one goes away and I was

191
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,840
now seeing with ghiraldini on the fact

192
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,700
that there is a microsoft document that

193
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,770
there is the possibility  To make

194
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,280
the system dump by crashing them having

195
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,080
first configured that in the event of a crash

196
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,660
to do a non-minimal dump but a

197
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,990
total time is a very nice thing that

198
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,430
sometimes happens in a natural way

199
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,620
put you are working on the systems has

200
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,140
not evolved into  this case here this an

201
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,440
official microsoft document so

202
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,180
basically a key a series

203
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,530
of registry keys to go to

204
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,490
modify and after which you give some

205
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,380
key combinations in the keyboard and

206
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,360
if you don't have a xv because this here doesn't

207
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,970
work on a xp technically it should

208
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,500


209
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,299
crash when it crashes it

210
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,100
dumps the memory after which once

211
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,840
it has made the napoli it restarts you

212
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,790
do nothing but have the roof and

213
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,839
go and recover

214
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,320
the file to be able to take it to

215
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,960
your product that  in this case it is

216
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,480
volatile that this point every now and then I

217
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,920
see myself thinking but all those times that

218
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,560
for example in storage systems

219
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,150
the storage and que  lli they make me

220
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,650
the analysis of the memory it is not that they

221
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,420
also recover my step I

222
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,730
would think no because then one

223
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,350
says we do the dumping we send

224
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,180
down to the laboratory who knows

225
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,020
what actually looks inside the laboratory oh well

226
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,040
we go on

227
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,510
once the dump the memory

228
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,860
basically your job is done

229
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,230
part with the usb stick run away

230
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,130
go where you want

231
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,780
and finally arrive in your

232
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,370
forensic station just to say 22

233
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,080
so no one wonders but the

234
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,900
forensic station how it is made you have an

235
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,080
operating system that can be any

236
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,970
you want but most  of cases the

237
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,000
tools that the expert foresees uses because

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,150
because the market rules dictate

239
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,460
that you have to do everything

240
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,200
faster and be sure about what you

241
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,720
do is a microsoft microsoft system

242
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,440
basically so you have a windows I

243
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,970
do not recommend windows 10 or maybe it

244
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,770
remains  some time more on windows 8

245
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,890
windows 7 you have commercial tools installed

246
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,810
and they are your trades  wings

247
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,790
that unfortunately require me to use

248
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,690
windows

249
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,640
if you use your commercials

250
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,760
usually in forensics having 34 56 cases in

251
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,310
parallel they are forced to use

252
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,990
these genes of tool not installed

253
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,670
the antivirus of course an activism

254
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,200
does not go there on these protections the

255
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,810
station must not be  absolutely

256
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,400
connected to the internet

257
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,750
if you have to do the tests on the internet

258
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,880
use sandboxes

259
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,860
then use web web systems thrown into

260
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,260
these tools and I recommend that you do not use

261
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,230
encrypted disks not because it cannot be

262
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,910
done but only because they carry emilia

263
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,520
cycles of cpu and then just the  access the

264
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,200
disk is always the same this

265
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,330
basically a france station and of

266
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,620
course it must be the station

267
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,530
where only you work there so

268
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,450
everyone knows me in the form setting in

269
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,860
a different sign because based on what

270
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,360
I do

271
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,680
if I have to do the analysis of phones I

272
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,520
use  commercial tools unfortunately and

273
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,990
therefore I use microsoft if I have to use

274
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,540
volatility for example not  I am a

275
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,290
virtual machine or sx because because in

276
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,450
any case the forensic expert must have

277
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,700
a 360 degree view of

278
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,650
operating systems, you do not have to be a

279
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,510
bit of a nut and to learn how the

280
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,610
operating system works the simplest thing

281
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,490
to do is to use it

282
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,470
perfectly  all this you download

283
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,320
volatility for mac

284
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,560
these are the sources after which

285
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,360
beautiful link that you must be

286
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,150
then explains how to install it

287
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,980
inside mac is done for maverick

288
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,990
but it works quietly even if

289
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,120
in the last two passions that have

290
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,990
come out you need the volatility profiles

291
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,850
what  he basically does fan parsing does not

292
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,350
look at everything inside and tries

293
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,870
to pass with a series of

294
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,279
information that he knows

295
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,730
to do the passing he must know how

296
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,709
that memory is structured because every

297
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:02,019
computer and then the computer that can

298
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:04,449
be a device

299
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:06,819
therefore a pc or a mac is different, or it can

300
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:09,519
also be a system, everyone is a risk in another

301
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,420
way

302
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,329
it has a different

303
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:15,579
memory management and a good tv tv and you

304
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:17,860
absolutely must tell it look that this here

305
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,420
is the memory that comes from a windows pc

306
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,490
this instead is a memory that comes

307
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,290
from a linux pc because they have a

308
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,569
different memory management system it

309
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:30,819
depends a lot  some little things change from the operating system and

310
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:32,620
within the operating system from

311
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,569
version to another

312
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:36,610
so you have to download the

313
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,930
so-called profiles then a whole

314
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,399
series of profiles there are others

315
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,999
for mac and linux that you can download them

316
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,040
easily in this link and they are

317
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,959
always updated can be convenient

318
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:54,019
because if you have to do the analysis

319
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:56,779
of a mac by default you are not

320
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,699
all found inside volatiles and therefore

321
00:12:58,699 --> 00:12:59,959
you can use these gifts

322
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:03,619
then you need this nice

323
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:06,050
make up plugin which is basically the one that

324
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,179
goes  to look up the password of the windows user

325
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:08,899


326
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:11,959
done this once you

327
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,399
have used volatility a lot a

328
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,720
command line tool does not know anything d  the

329
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,809
graphical interface shows you the

330
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:22,389
list of plugins you have available

331
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:25,610
or the list of scripts that

332
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,980
create something specific

333
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,230
these are the commands to be able to

334
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,660
launch it is this here instead are a

335
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,509
description of the operations that that

336
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,559
specific plugin is going to do  this thing

337
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,269
means that there is a separate

338
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:44,989
community that writes special plugins

339
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:46,429
to be able to be

340
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,290
specific to the memory information so

341
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,139
imagine the potential

342
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,869
behind this tool also because

343
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:56,589


344
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:59,389
basically everything from the programs that are

345
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,429
ready goes into memory  at the connections you see that

346
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:04,009
you have the list of printers in

347
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,929
pieces of document that you are

348
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,970
printing anyway so memory you have a

349
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,100
large amount of information that until

350
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,110
a few years ago was ignored now

351
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,209
actually you are starting to

352
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:18,649
use it as much as possible to be able

353
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,710
to do this  case export the information

354
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,840
from the ladies you have given use

355
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,370
this  beautiful command

356
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,590
basically calls up a

357
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,530
script in python and tells us to use

358
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:36,690
the module the mimic module let's say to

359
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,220
be executed within this

360
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,260
damage of memories using this

361
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,030
profile this thing means that I

362
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,760
had inside I dumped

363
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,970
my  memory inside a windows 7

364
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,290
service pack 1

365
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,620
ok launch this this so

366
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,200
these are not series of profiles wait

367
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,870
more or less in two minutes and at a certain

368
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,310
point track you have to buy the username

369
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,800
associated with the unencrypted password

370
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,220
quietly placed there in less than ten

371
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,700
minutes

372
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,160
the question one asks is ok now that

373
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,540
the user password is recovered what

374
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,790
do I do apart from the jokes on the systems

375
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,150
that if you can indulge yourself then

376
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,050
at work for there forensics recovering a

377
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,850
password can be very useful because

378
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,340
that step can be used  to

379
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,560
encrypt external drives or it can

380
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,000
be the same one that used me

381
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,160
in the phone in the mobile phone

382
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,960
or it can eg  be the same password that is

383
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,020
used to backup the encrypted backup of the

384
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,860
iPhone

385
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,680
so all these steps are here that

386
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,480
are inside the evidence for

387
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,610
the forensic analyst they are convenient because

388
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,950
then they can be put aside and

389
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,990
can be used to

390
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,200
attack  devices or containers that

391
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,390
are encrypted ok so this this

392
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,660
fast we will have to be on time this

393
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,210
quick introduction only

394
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,760
shows you the potential that this

395
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,000
utility volatility gives the possibility that

396
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,070
a usb stick to make a physical time

397
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,410
of a pc and to export

398
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,240
safely  the user paste do not

399
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,370
forget that then the password can

400
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,320
be used it can be the same in the

401
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,960
e-mail or in other things

402
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,650
ok I would say that I am finished here if you

403
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:30,090
have no questions greetings I wanted to

404
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,600
skip

405
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:42,089
and question during the dump phase is it

406
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:46,860
possible  that ftk if possible that it is

407
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,070
intercepted by antivirus no

408
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:50,910
to the

409
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,950
ok ft operation which then starts from the assumption

410
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,440
that they give the  memory unfortunately

411
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,870
you have to be administrators that

412
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,050
little thing that maybe one does not

413
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,510
notice but you have to have the possibility to

414
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,420
make from all the part of memory no

415
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,640
ft that does not make calls that are

416
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,819
seen by the antivirus systems or by

417
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,179
intruder detection system that we

418
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,709
cannot  see how anyway or of itself

419
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,030
malicious of

420
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,630
course it is a very

421
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,179
relative speech what I do because that

422
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,119
if tomorrow morning mcafee changes its

423
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,309
policies and what is a code of a

424
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:31,440
piece of the code of ethics and malicious

425
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,780
I make it appear as an attempt  of

426
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,660
intrusion and it is clear that what is coming

427
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,510
is let's say seen no it's all very

428
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,400
relative in computer science no what

429
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,860
is now valid now maybe next month is

430
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,600
no longer worth curves currently with

431
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,390
effects that no

432
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,370
type of antivirus notices no from this point of

433
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,679
view we are enough

434
00:17:52,679 --> 00:18:01,260
rest assured ok another question sorry nice forensics

435
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,120
as you said before

436
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,210
to model this thanks

437
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,800
if there was an analysis to be done  of this

438
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,690
type as you can do without

439
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,320
dirtying the ram memory

440
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,550
then you go and look directly at the

441
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,480
facts on stt I recommend a hard disk known

442
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,490
damage as usually happens but

443
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,230
usually they do not give you just in the disk of

444
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,870
damage a computer 9 more whole a  sometimes

445
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,790
they also give you the mouse the printer

446
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,360
everything else that for certain things can

447
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,610
be for certain things can be convenient

448
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,620
because if they are in a family you can

449
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,010
imagine if for a crime of pedophilia

450
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,830
there is no computer where there is no

451
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,800
access step and that computer has them

452
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,350
available to everyone no then in that

453
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,090
case they say that we have taken

454
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,940
pictures perfect pedo porno they

455
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,270
used them computer to computer and

456
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,030
open everyone could could in

457
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,410
quotes choose what we do

458
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,370
you can think of the idea  to verify the

459
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,870
digital quotas that are inside

460
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,130
the keyboard

461
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,110
so in some respects they could

462
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,730
also be a good idea while in the

463
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,830
past in reality everything was taken

464
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,750
because in the dub  bio you can take it

465
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,580
all away no we leave white at the

466
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,280
doorstep in this case here we go to

467
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,440
do an analysis of the file if it is a

468
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,330
laptop of the hibernation file if you are

469
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,580
a normal pc instead you can see if you

470
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:23,910
can of

471
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,830
course  recover a few things

472
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,070
but it's all very relative it depends a

473
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:35,160
lot said ok so perfect place

474
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,170
guys it was a pleasure to approach
