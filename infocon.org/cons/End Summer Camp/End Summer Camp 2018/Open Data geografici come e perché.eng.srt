1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
my name is amedeo fadini i am a member of

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,970
geforce punto.it associations for

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,500
free geographic information i will

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,510
calmly introduce myself tomorrow because this

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,820
was the talk that delhi brentan had to do

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,460
which instead officials he is also a

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,100
member and official of the veneto region

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,920
and today unfortunately he is  practically blocked

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,100
in the office to try to make

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,810
the infrastructures work with territorial data

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,300
which is then what I present again trying for

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,300
a moment to explain so the idea was

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,610
the geographic open data of in the

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,800
geographical area you know that more or less in

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,770
2012 it was a  explosion of

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,660
open data portals it is normally you do it yes I

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,539
shook my head normally the

18
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,910
logic is to say since they are

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,850
important data for companies

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,370
also for start-ups also to be able to

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,550
make money on them produce pis

22
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,500
as they were  paid with my taxes it

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,510
is right that they are

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,170
freely available then the list of

25
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,750
pharmacies the actual number of

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,729
immigrants the number effe  number of

27
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,000
unemployed not practically most

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,939
of the most requested data were in any case

29
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,880
data of a geographical nature i.e. how many

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,130
are the inhabitants of my neighborhood

31
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,680
ok ISTAT knows it has always known now

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,350
it also publishes it with the

33
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,850
2011 and 2012 census data practically us

34
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,500
there  we usually occupy the

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,420
free geographic and free geographic data in

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,780
reality this all the portals of the

37
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,750
regions respond to a precise

38
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,640
indication of the law which is a

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,990
European directive inspire here I assume that

40
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,869
the video also works but you can find it

41
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,390
on the website of the European commission that

42
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,210
speaks  to inspire the directive what it

43
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,170
says since the environmental data have a

44
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,140
certain importance and since as you see

45
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,600
here he says the river the bad habit is

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,910
that it is not interrupted

47
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,390
by a state if it is polluted in a certain

48
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,660
point due to the state of the state

49
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,630
to  mount practically therefore the po se

50
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,630
singh if it is polluted in piedmont

51
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,060
is not that suddenly on the border with the

52
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,690
veneto

53
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,940
i  Our governor blocks the

54
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,090
pollutants and sends them back so

55
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,490
clearly if a spill happens

56
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,600
no

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,640
in Piedmont you need to have the

58
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,220
necessary geographical data.Here it will be for example

59
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,340
of the volcano practically to know where

60
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,130
these pollutants will end up for

61
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,390
example within a

62
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,070
European project  of the adriatic and ionian

63
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,560
the ok and neri smart institute of re

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,880
venice the institute of marine sciences

65
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,280
where I work they worked a model in

66
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,020
which as soon as an oil tanker enters it

67
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,210
is practically drawn from

68
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,580
Puglia but or in the otranto canal it

69
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,890
is traced its

70
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,620
risk class because some countries

71
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,770
keep them better than oil tankers others do not

72
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,830
and it is evaluated precisely

73
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,480
a model is run which in the event of an

74
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,030
accident immediately tells where

75
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,250
to go to take measures where it

76
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,020
could arrive based on the currents

77
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,240
etc. this is what the

78
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,970
systems do  of geographic information

79
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,860
we arrive the slides ideas lyon this is

80
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,640
too long q  his aiko to make

81
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,060
truly open data an infrastructure

82
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,810
of spatial data must be

83
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,489
interoperable no therefore normally the

84
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,950
data then in these days

85
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,930
you will come to ask me or even

86
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,390
alberto the colleague normally from

87
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,130
our stock you connect

88
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,440
services that are on a server  they are web

89
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,410
services with http protocol that are

90
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,450
well established and that provide

91
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,880
maps directly or give me

92
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,250
the geometries practically or the

93
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,120
classic system download but the

94
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,060
important service because downloading a

95
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,920
data that exists on an Italian scale

96
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,900
yesterday I tried with the

97
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,389
mosaic landslides from  'ispra but we can stay

98
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,699
with the sword a cartography let's say

99
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:21,488
landslide hazard areas in Italy

100
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:24,759
weighs a gig and two in general and no one is

101
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,370
ever interested in making a map that goes

102
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,860
from the alps to the pyramids from the manzanarre

103
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,360
to the rhine in short in this case as a

104
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,240
champion  of italy in lampedusa

105
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,139
practically also because lampedusa

106
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,560
landslides nisba for which the service  it

107
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,060
allows me to request the

108
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,669
geographic data only on the area that

109
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:48,880
interests me then which we are talking about and these things

110
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,780
have been put these standards have

111
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,180
been defined by the open gerspach

112
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,700
consortium practically another topic of

113
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,000
aidi tia the portals is

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,090
practically another pillar of the  tv and the

115
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,580
inspire directive no since the data in

116
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,560
any case weighs above all the data from

117
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,510
orthophoto satellite etc.

118
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,810
it is not that every municipality has to duplicate

119
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,090
the cd this still happens in many

120
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,330
regions with the cartography of the region

121
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,070
etc.

122
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,490
a server no on the other servers

123
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,860
where people look for it we do not

124
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,170
simply put a catalog with the link

125
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,840
that refers to these molten

126
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,630
metadata that you have already heard of and are

127
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,400
also available on all

128
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,070
portals even on sicán portals on

129
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,710
portals i  data gov.it veneto.it then there

130
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,690
are presentation services that then

131
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,640
display the map or a

132
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,280
web viewer to understand what data I am

133
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,470
talking and if they do it at my house before

134
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,320
downloading them and then

135
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,030
actually accessing the data well this was

136
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,070
what I was interested in making you understand

137
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,430
why the new and dt of the Veneto but

138
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,910
most of the idt are developed with

139
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,140
free geographic software because this

140
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,380
software is of  far better than

141
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,070
proprietary software it is used in

142
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,840
all public administrations because it

143
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,880
has no license costs no when it comes

144
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,560
to open source the first thing one

145
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,970
understands is free

146
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,070
no in reality it is not at all true

147
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,010
because we clearly know that however

148
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,700
this is to do you  understand more or less the

149
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,740
complexity we say when one says

150
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,410
we do an open data portal

151
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,560
with regard to geographic data

152
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,540
we normally have a posner database

153
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,150
sequele has a geographic extension is

154
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,840
called post gis and makes shoes

155
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,560
quietly to oracle

156
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,260
if one presents oracle says the  contrary

157
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,470
but in reality from various tests depends on the

158
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,110
tuning, however,

159
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,450
an absolutely very powerful database

160
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,570
also for the  and geographical operations that is

161
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,700
the geodata ball means that

162
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,250
usually when I do

163
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,280
a clipping operation give me the landslides of the Veneto I

164
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,710
do it with a select so I have

165
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,330
no problem let's say to use it

166
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,580
also on the server side from command line services

167
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,130
let's say fragment  no even

168
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,050
when I have to create new

169
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,660
geometries cut out the set were for

170
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,640
which the Veneto region still has something

171
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,160
on oracle towards negative profile the

172
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,900
geographical part still goes on

173
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,470
possession or post gis view

174
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,970
oracle tables

175
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,700
we have catalog services is also

176
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,850
a real one  let's say content

177
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,800
management system for maps which is

178
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,190
called day the most important part is

179
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,120
the cartographic server no so if you

180
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,160
don't know what a gis application is,

181
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,380
come and hear my talk tomorrow

182
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,870
on which gis is still a gis application and

183
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,600
what it allows me  to use

184
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,560
spatial data and with respect to heat,

185
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,810
spatial data are generally managed

186
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,840
by geome  trie and attributes

187
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,670
no so when we find ourselves with

188
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,560
those who use the cases we now say that

189
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,460
we have the attributes

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,480
no there will be no

191
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,880


192
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,370


193
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,460


194
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,640
ulterior motive ok so a table that describes that geometry at the server level map server or geoserver or pugi

195
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,419
server do  precisely this work of

196
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,870
reading the geographic data files, the

197
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,270
geometries and creating the map let's say

198
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,010
visualize them and render the map

199
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,750
then it is also a question of overlapping

200
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,030
because there are a whole series of

201
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,180
problems because although someone

202
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,300
is again convinced the earth is not

203
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,970
flat  and therefore there are various

204
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,760
deformation algorithms of the maps to make them

205
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,040
to make them flat no so they are all

206
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,960
the reference systems however the part

207
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,110
we say geographic is managed by an

208
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,390
application server of this type that

209
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,770
reads the data and is able to

210
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,140
present them open the era also  on this

211
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,540
we do a little tomorrow or smap are

212
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,460
anyway display platforms

213
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,800
on a website of the data m  a most of the

214
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,020
time I can connect to geoserver

215
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,090
amap server even with a

216
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,030
desktop application and I go to consume the

217
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,350
services vms arges instead it is not

218
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,610
free software but let's say it is more or less

219
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,730
the proprietary ecosystem that until

220
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,829
let's say 5 10 years ago  until

221
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:51,930
geforce punto.it was born it was the

222
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,779
master because in any case one comes out on the

223
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,730
market and says we are the only ones who

224
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,680
make a software of this type it

225
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,819
is not true but people believe it and now

226
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:04,740
while the desktop version was

227
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,290
also sold to  30,000 euro of license

228
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,290
when there were no licenses and

229
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:15,389
annual licenses now instead every time

230
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:18,509
there is a price ask your

231
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:20,970
salesman now obviously they also do arges by

232
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,970
now in a series of free services

233
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,329
where as we know the goods are

234
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:30,149
the consideration  it is made up of the

235
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:33,839
user himself and his data here

236
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,420
is more or less a little bit of the project ok

237
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,610
okay how many information resources more or

238
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,079
less about the dt after I show you

239
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,000
the existing one  and or maybe even the

240
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,279
new one is more or less 700 levels for

241
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,839
example there were all the data of the soils

242
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,839
from harp made up in veneto no the

243
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,560
soil map no this is a bit of the project the

244
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,100
license ok the veneto region as it applies to

245
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,779
various public administrations  it went

246
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,019
on a license I have 2.0 it is very

247
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,639
similar to the bill

248
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,189
if you have doubts about the licenses we talk about it

249
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:08,310
in private however some elements are

250
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,279
in cc by the cc by normally for geographic data

251
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,399
it applies up there because

252
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,319
more often than not I have a bank  data I do not have

253
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:19,170
an image that is reproduced

254
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,230
as modified the database is

255
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,170
integrated, improved, partially set,

256
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,180
etc. so if I have the cartography

257
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,459
of the fort no then I download the

258
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:33,120
geometry of the fort then only that I

259
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,059


260
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,549
improve it because it is not precise therefore  the

261
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:39,979
precise I reload it by reloading its

262
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:43,459
for street map I can do it because the

263
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,519
initial ctr of the Veneto region has a

264
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,979
permissive license and already in 2006 had

265
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:50,809
given an ad hoc permit for

266
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:53,599
loading  to on the open street map which is a

267
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:57,349
collaborative map in short, it is the license

268
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,399
or of bl at the end is relatively

269
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,289
compatible with her or of 2.0 however

270
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,539
in short there are license problems

271
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:08,599
that often block the possibility

272
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,339
for the region to publish

273
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:12,139
data that also  therefore he has the clouds of

274
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,809
leading points of the three peaks hand on which

275
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:16,939
I worked when he worked in the region

276
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:20,389
in fact those there the ministry are his

277
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:22,999
and he tells the region yes we send them and

278
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:25,399
make us a transfer that we send them the cd

279
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,519
no and then the region makes a  bank transfer of

280
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,519
7 euros to justify the costs of

281
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,239
duplicating the cd for which open

282
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:37,129
data also means going down a little

283
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:39,219
pacts with some administrative logic

284
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:42,499
like this and often we do not find the data

285
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:44,059
not because they are not there they do not

286
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:46,309
want to give them but simply because

287
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:49,239
inside the various structures it is

288
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:53,299
complicated to have them or this

289
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:55,359
new infrastructure required two years

290
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:59,379
to be created so maybe

291
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,819
objectively not them  we find on the site

292
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:03,829
maybe if we call ii and we find a

293
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:06,499
kind person says come here with

294
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:08,299
the hard disk that the data and we give it

295
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:09,859
in short this was what I was

296
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:12,089
interested in saying

297
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:14,100
a question you could ask later is

298
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,050
why the geographic data have the

299
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:21,209
regions here  basically

300
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:26,309
the functions of the services are fine but

301
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:28,740
what interests us as citizens and

302
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,499
use and analysis of information

303
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:34,170
the rest more or less concerns the region

304
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,850
within this discovery service

305
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,699
no search is not absolutely

306
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:45,019
simple simple to do practically

307
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:47,220
had  you were born of patience because there

308
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,470
are so many slides and I wanted to do only the

309
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,189
ones you need and that's not

310
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:55,379
more or less however the structure

311
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,209
can be assigned the applications to 3

312
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:00,149
for the data layer so however in this

313
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,720
case on several databases practically the

314
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,589
service layer where cenize  that is not what

315
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,389
has to do with motion, however, here we find

316
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:12,269
the geoserver cartographic server for

317
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,910
directly publishing the services  and

318
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,980
then they as application servers have

319
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,899
a whole series of elements that allows you

320
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,089
to see wordpress directly in

321
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:24,029
order to manage bringing users

322
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,429
because clearly there are data that

323
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:29,790
are addressed directly to the municipalities

324
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,449
then they made a special metadata portal

325
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:35,339
and the metadata also have

326
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,589
some  very stringent specifications

327
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:41,699
defined both by inspire and by the

328
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,579
national catalog which should be let's say an

329
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:49,230
end point of the inspire structure most

330
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,470
of the time

331
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,480
most of the work that prevents the

332
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,340
publication of a data is because there

333
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,170
is no metadata so returning for

334
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,540
example to before no  I ok or the

335
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,460
cartography and with the geometry of the fort

336
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,050
the canal maybe even the indication

337
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,720
of the bathymetry of the canal but to

338
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,370
be honest and to be in accordance with the

339
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,410
law I have to say that geometry that

340
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,230
scale is valid equivalent scale because

341
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,150
being vector I can enlarge it

342
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,670
also on a scale of 1 to 1 and then there are

343
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,320
some surveyors in the room

344
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,080
normally here  ando says geometri 1

345
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,330
anyway it says well then I do in scale

346
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,290
1 to 50

347
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,380
no that geometry there in the metadata says

348
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,450
that the equivalent scale of the ctr maybe

349
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,000
it was comes from the scan of a

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,840
printed paper at 5 thousand in any case

351
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,970
also the printed paper comes from  an

352
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,250
airplane that has flown a certain

353
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,190
altitude and has returned an aerial image

354
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,280
then rectified garden that is worth 10 thousand

355
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,190
for which or tolerances that can

356
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,220
even be a meter 2000 very well

357
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,800
if I have to make a hiking discard

358
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,050
no because the crowd in scale maybe  1

359
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,140
25,000 or even 15,000 or even one to

360
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,970
2000 the information panel that there is

361
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,010
out the recovery just an extract of

362
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,000
ctr however 88 that I cannot use it to

363
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,130
land a drone because if it is a meter

364
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,900
of difference it ends up in the water

365
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,650
ok not  I can use it to launch

366
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,720
a self-driving car that trusts the

367
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,260
gps so one of the problems that

368
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,520
people do not understand is that the vector data

369
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,899
that there is still a

370
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,329
one thing this I do not know b  ene what it is

371
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:30,619
because screenshot let's see for a moment

372
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:33,779
this is the inter phase ok some

373
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,670
screenshots in the sense they have

374
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:41,040
largely renewed largely the graphics

375
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,749
then or of the geographic data viewers

376
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:44,730
so if all goes well and if

377
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,499
it makes sense there is a  webgis online.com talk

378
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,240
also about how to do it in web gis so

379
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,579
in reality here we have a great use

380
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,439
of open source software compared to

381
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:59,189
the previous one there is the online photo library area

382
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:00,420


383
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,670
most of the historical photos so

384
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,859
we have aerial photos also of 54

385
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,809
due to licensing problems the

386
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:08,490
common citizen can have a sky but in short by

387
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,439
dint of insisting through the municipality

388
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,000
through the university the research body in

389
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,459
short, there are really many data in the region

390
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,449
and also very very

391
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:19,169
interesting or you can

392
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:21,750
buy them I have purchased  an orthophoto

393
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,380
and 54 x 7 euros the owner

394
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,449
the military geographic geographic institute

395
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,679
practically then the

396
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,950
second generation dt

397
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,640
live tools here at the end

398
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,500
most of the  the users are

399
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,810
internal users, that is, of the regional structures

400
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,810
that most of the time already

401
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,700
within the region itself

402
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,310
the soil defense management the infrastructure management

403
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,500
do not share the same cartography but

404
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,910
when we say the same cartography

405
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,650
we are also talking about

406
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,900
municipal borders that over the years  maybe they are

407
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,510
adjusted by having this possibility of

408
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,370
going to a larger scale when a common

409
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,220
fall urban plan maybe notices

410
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,520
that the border is slightly shifted and

411
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,940
therefore yes it usually marks it

412
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,490
directly inside woods or other

413
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:13,970
things

414
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,460
I try to show you how long I have

415
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,700
before the questions

416
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,470
perfect then the dt punto region

417
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,930
veneto.it is let's say

418
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,400
the current site while the new one

419
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,770
should theoretically be susta jing

420
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:39,170
oi of t2i of t2 punto region veneto.it

421
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,940
is not loading a strange club

422
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,940
because we had a 4 gb

423
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,840
frighteningly fast

424
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,640
until a moment ago ok

425
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,960
here still around

426
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,030
so we can say that you have  I love finished

427
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,640
and oh well here I basically leave you for a

428
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,730
moment the two the two the two elements because

429
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,550
then one of the big problems is that in the

430
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,040
end it is very difficult to download the data

431
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,560
that is also on the other regional portals

432
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,440
is very problematic but all in all

433
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,180
there are various ways of  search and

434
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,430
then if one loses a night then

435
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,580
gets oriented in case of doubts send an

436
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,830
email to the undersigned searched geforce

437
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,930
punto.it hodges italia in short ask

438
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:34,480
ask ask is a good question

439
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,130
let's say that in the heat you find many

440
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,430
digis data importers let's say they

441
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,050
access a  common library or

442
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,940
access higher since more

443
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,670
services were enough how can an inexperienced user

444
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,450
know which map or database is

445
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,240
yielding the plugin on duty there is a

446
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,140
regulation there is something yes then there is the

447
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,630
regulation but it is enough  free so much

448
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,640
that often people confuse the

449
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,860
technology used which are

450
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,320
largely open source so the

451
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,710
vms protocol for example that one of the standard

452
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,070
p  for web services it confuses it with the

453
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,020
legislation the legislation is obviously

454
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,649
well written and does not say which protocol

455
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:25,130
you must use it says that it must be an

456
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,169
interoperable protocol that you must not

457
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:29,419
duplicate the data it remains to have what

458
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:32,260
I have updated for which

459
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,960
in the field it largely falls on e

460
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,750
the importer of a file that is the chef

461
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,710
file no the sd shapefile format is a

462
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,900
proprietary format of which strangely

463
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,390
because in america then beings that are

464
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,370
precisely the multination manages agis

465
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,950
were primigi mirante has spread

466
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,960
the specifications almost from the beginning

467
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,610
so that  the other programs

468
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,160
could read and even write it and it has

469
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,620
become an interchange format and

470
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,540
this is absolutely deleterious in

471
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,940
2018 because it is a format that was

472
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,400
developed in the 80s and also in terms

473
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,400
of topological correctness of the

474
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,640
geometries makes it plant many times the

475
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,470
program until my

476
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,960
client crashes stop the card doesn't hang because

477
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,580
it has no problems with correctness was paul

478
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,490
ojika qu  then it means that the

479
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,680
topolone correctness is similar that if I in

480
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,840
an urban plan most of the time

481
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,930
this two rectangles these two rectangles

482
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,640
that have one side in common are

483
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,190
drawn twice but must have

484
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,990
only two vertices and these two years

485
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,580
must be in common to the  same

486
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,080
coordinates because if I start to have

487
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,660
a rectangle that has a straight side with

488
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,490
a vertex in the middle and the other

489
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:42,850
has 2

490
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,900
ok, that is, at the end then the

491
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,620
computational operations club

492
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,630
the cad only needs to arrive at a sheet of

493
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,970
paper and then in some  way print

494
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,950
who cares print the big line

495
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,100
covers all the changes below

496
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,740
you think about it you think about these vertices

497
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,810
then you plant for which to plant a

498
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,210
server because you then load more

499
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,220
often that is this shell file format which

500
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,320
is a de facto interchange and is

501
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,420
difficult from the south to supplant because

502
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,410
for a thousand reasons

503
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,870
there are very verbose nose interchange formats

504
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,630
very far ahead etc. and

505
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,150
more than the v  On the other hand, if you access a

506
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,550
server, you need to know what the rack and

507
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,180
server are for

508
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,400
but it is not so much the problem and above all to

509
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,200
have the data that is to

510
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,390
actually understand that cartography there

511
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,270
because it was made and eder and

512
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,420
if you can use it for the purpose it serves to

513
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,730
you for whom the road graph of a

514
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,490
navigator basically you cannot

515
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,800
use to calculate the land consumption

516
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,990
because it does not tell you how wide the

517
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,120
road is we follow you highway nobody

518
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,740
went there to measure it to the cm the width

519
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,120
the width of the roadway

520
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,010
you have explained that the data  geographical

521
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,170
have been released with two

522
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:14,690
different licenses 1 cc by and then another idea

523
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,050
Italian open data license

524
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:20,600
substantially and then maybe two

525
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,310
high schools sorry then ends a license

526
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,630
made at Italian level to release

527
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:33,980
geographic data or what type of license but it

528
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,680
is a license  done at an

529
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,160
Italian level for all types of data,

530
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,200
the mistake was to do it at an

531
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,910
Italian level because in any case the data run

532
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,220
at least in the  neon and European but

533
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,410
substantially the clauses are like

534
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,470
that of the open audio bl that the

535
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,710
open street map it concerns is

536
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,720
focused in short on databases and

537
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,780
normally the clauses concern that

538
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,550
the

539
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,280
ownership of the data cannot be appropriated and that the

540
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,180
derivative works must be  or not distributed with the

541
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,790
same license and with the indication that

542
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,460
the derivative works are derivative works

543
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,800
therefore that the database has been

544
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,960
integrated the problem of cc by and

545
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,660
when you use only a part of the

546
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,390
content that often does not have to

547
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,340
drag back so you  it is

548
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,410
good for maps already made

549
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,470
historical maps or for images but for data

550
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,690
that can also take on very

551
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,030
very different aspects in general it takes a

552
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,750
slightly

553
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,510
better license but on all newspapers a

554
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,080
thousand licenses have been used and there are

555
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,080
also compatibility problems  for

556
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,660
example according to the open street map

557
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,330
fondation the teigen region

558
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,660
piedmont paper which is distributed in cc by is

559
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,330
almost incompatible  that is, one-way

560
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,850
can be imported into an open street map

561
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,820
but then the Piedmont region cannot

562
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,660
reuse the open street map data

563
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,160
without releasing it.

564
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,700


565
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,160


566
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,230


567
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,930
published a data must be clear

568
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,320
what can be done from 2006 to 2010 the

569
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,450
Veneto region had published given for

570
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,670
free went to conferences to

571
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,770
say to us we have made

572
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,050
available to all citizens

573
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,660
we as an association

574
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,970
took advantage of the presentation

575
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,340
made me a press release saying  well

576
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,020
good you have published the data now

577
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,110
give it a license because if this

578
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,630
data does not have a license you open the

579
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,850
gate but you do not give it the legs to

580
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,070
send it around because then one in the

581
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,900
end says what I can do I can

582
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,420
use it I discover profit for work or

583
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,870
then  denounce me because he is the then

584
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,000
manager who then I met in

585
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,890
person he is very angry

586
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,900
went to his consultant open

587
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,390
data portal look at what he writes to me amedeo fadini

588
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,820
tells me that we do not have the license

589
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,980
but this is crazy but it is not possible

590
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,730
I answered yes it is true he is right where it

591
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,800
is then the new portal

592
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,100
with italy came out  open data, however, is

593
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,900
essential that there is a license that

594
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,270
is a license that allows reuse

595
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,610
big problem with the cadastre data

596
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,890
have been published only through

597
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,380
a business service so I have

598
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,350
an image with the cadastre data but

599
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,720
they have assigned a license  cc by

600
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,000
ndn c therefore

601
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
any commercial use would be prohibited and

602
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,790
any derivative work means that

603
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,400
when the cadastre cartography and

604
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,830
below it I put an airplane photo or the

605
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,980
technical map or a card with the

606
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,650
addresses to know where that

607
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,230
image is there I absolutely cannot do

608
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,800
nothing like a friend of ours says I can

609
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,170
take it to the bathroom and that's it I can't

610
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,240
publish it in a book I can't

611
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,880
use it on a relationship  technical less

612
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,450
than ever

613
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,150
if I do urban planning in the report

614
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,070
a zoning plan because that is

615
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,870
something that I get paid so I

616
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,180
would also violate the nc for which due to

617
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,460
ignorance of the licensing system or

618
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,530
perhaps we say out of bad faith

619
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,350
to these the very important data which is

620
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,780
the  cadastral cartography has been given

621
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,790
a license that does not allow

622
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,470
anything to be done about it and they continue to ignore

623
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,900
this thing despite the fact that many people

624
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,220
even in the parliamentary commission

625
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,530
of inquiry have pointed out to them that

626
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,000
there is no open data so that's

627
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,780
enough ok no you forgot the

628
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,510
question that  I did it because because the

629
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,790
geographic data do the regions do not

630
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,830
when we have four

631
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,950
cartographic bodies of the state which are

632
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,350
the military geographic

633
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,800
institute the hydrographic institute of the navy

634
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,200
the territorial agency which has

635
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,620
now also become the revenue agency

636
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,420
it is another that is so insignificant

637
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,260
that I forget it but let's say that

638
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,960
they would not have a state task  ra

639
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,940
the hydrographic institute actually makes the

640
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,070
nautical maps no the regions have

641
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,590
begun to make the paper the

642
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,540
technical map and therefore the basic cartography

643
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,010
where this trees buildings rivers roads

644
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,440
precisely in order to support

645
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,310
urban planning which is a

646
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,500
matter of exclusive competence of

647
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,480
Regions therefore in order to be able to design

648
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,610


649
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,640


650
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,190
land use plans on a basis that corresponds to reality because call cadastre is not interested in reality the

651
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,170
cadastre generally deals with the

652
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,420
confines for which the cadastre lives on the

653
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,070
borders of reality I normally say

654
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,350
for which this cartographic basis from

655
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,210
70s onwards with various regional laws

656
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,890
it was made by the regions to

657
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,770
allow the municipalities to then make

658
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,620
regulatory plans that had

659
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,650
certain clear measures so even with the

660
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,840
tolerance of we said before to the 5 thousand or

661
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,540
to the 10 thousand in the mountains

662
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,790
if I do  a buildable area and the

663
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,160
design even more with jeans but

664
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,290
also with cad da I can

665
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:36,080
measure the of  sign and occupies 20 thousand

666
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,240
square meters of building areas when

667
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,670
I go on the ground to measure it oh well it

668
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:45,380
will be 21,000 it will be 19,700 but I can

669
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,120
have these differences here it is not that it

670
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,540
went from 10 to 20 thousand ok if I still

671
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,870
draw a quarry area and then someone

672
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,120
goes there  to dig it is not that then it digs me

673
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,310
twice the cubic meters and healthy but

674
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,530
here it was not clear I took mine

675
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,630
as well that ladder because then on

676
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,110
this it does so that we generally

677
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,670
have a series of regional portals

678
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,840
that are also very  different from each other and

679
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,150
a little difficult to use

680
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,560
the end point for all the metadata would be

681
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,830
managed by agip and the

682
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,090
national repertory of spatial data in acronym

683
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:35,120
r ndt ayew dati.gov.it the address is not missing

684
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,390
but this we say would be

685
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:43,010
the  end point where I can go to look for

686
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,490
a bit

687
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:52,360
all the data the data the metadata

688
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,850
concerning ok looking for the lagoon of venice

689
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,270
for example I still find a data and it

690
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,429
tells me this data was drawn by

691
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:03,730
arpa veneto I can count  ttarli here here are the

692
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,890
contacts are very important and that is

693
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,860
often people go to the site they spend a

694
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,350
night there too I do not find the data they

695
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,530
need and complain on facebook about cecco

696
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,910
the region the harp does not go sometimes it

697
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,360
is not there  willful behind by calling or sending

698
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,270
an email to these people objectively

699
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,580
it happened to me as the Emilia

700
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,830
Romagna region phone happy look I'm

701
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,840
trying to republish one of your

702
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,850
services but since you had the

703
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,600
genius to give a name to each read

704
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,790
these names contain a

705
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:43,750
slash inside  no so the proper name of the

706
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,640
resource is true slash inside my

707
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,490
server rightly says I can't find a layer

708
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,980
because it looks for a sub-level it's not that

709
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,840
you could change the names put an

710
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,720
alias on it there are three no figured but

711
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,059
anyway I told him look myopia and  that

712
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:00,130
if I make you a lot of traffic on your

713
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,679
server send me an e-mail alert me and

714
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:05,710
I see to make some limitations stone

715
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,360
all good people with whom we

716
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,480
mean, among other things, that is that for

717
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,400
work publish data and therefore they

718
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,920
need to prove to the

719
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,770
politician on duty that those data are

720
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,559
actually used because the

721
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,200
politician says well there is google

722
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,260
yes there is google maps no but google maps does not

723
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,559
have to answer anyone if he draws an

724
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:32,890
area of  20,000 square meters and in

725
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,720
reality and

726
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,020
twelve thousand google maps apart from the fact that in

727
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,940
the construction process a

728
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,100
difficult mistake goes away, he does not have to answer to

729
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,710
anyone if he decides how it happened here to

730
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,750
call an island island of roses

731
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,510
because the hotel built above is

732
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,800
called  isola delle rose

733
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,590
even if in reality for several centuries it has been

734
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:56,190
called sacca sessola ok so give

735
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,720
everything in the hands of google maps

736
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,740
well now it's over thanks and

737
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,000
tomorrow for the other talks

738
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,089
[Applause]
