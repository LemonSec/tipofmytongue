1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
so hello everyone this happened

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,120
around 2012

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,809
here talking about open data and after six

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,710
years the strange thing is that

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,060
what I was telling more or less six

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,279
years ago we made it together with the

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,170
municipality of venice in the venice pavilion

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,800
of the biennale with the  pavilion that is

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,859
still open you have until the end of

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,920
November to go and visit it is

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,320
practically an

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,840
urban data management project in which we

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,030
made sure that all the various subjects that

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,110
adhered to this venice pavilion

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,309
shared their knowledge

16
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,050
through data on the works they have

17
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,280
product this is the banner that

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,219
presents it that is the website in

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,649
which we not only wanted to

20
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,530
present the usual use cases and

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,289
various bales but we also wanted to

22
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,719
directly enter the data of the documents and

23
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,700
materials that had been produced.

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,960
the pavilion in 9

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,369
very large screens on which

26
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,560
micro videos of about one

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,850
and a half minutes or two are projected  more and

28
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,960
use cases for example which are the

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,659
historical tdd reconstruction of portions of

30
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,210
venice the development of

31
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,350
the tide trend in the eighteenth century today is

32
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,930
all these use cases are attached the

33
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,119
data that can be downloaded directly

34
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,159
from the site

35
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,210
generally  we tried to

36
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,549
promote licenses that were open in

37
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,829
such a way that it was possible and reuse

38
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,350
and implementation this was not always

39
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,210
possible because maybe in some

40
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,070
cases the universities and institutes

41
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,979
used proprietary data but

42
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,810
those of the municipality of Venice are all

43
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,740
available

44
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,990
me  i am luca cossato i am part of you i

45
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,229
am the owners of the company

46
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,630
that thinks it now sd state that has

47
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,310
dealt with data management of the

48
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,380
venice pavilion

49
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,410
in substance data management dedicated

50
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,720
with a subject in this case of such an

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,360
articulated event consists

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,890
mainly in looking  to collect and

53
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,599
see what

54
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,180
the various entities have available to the various structures

55
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,370
what a lot  it is often

56
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,260
taken for granted that it is precisely to say that the

57
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,879
data is there,

58
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,440
the problem is that very often the data,

59
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,239
even if there is, is really messed up

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,150
or it belongs to someone or takes

61
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,730
someone in some part of their

62
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,410
computer but the basic concept is not necessarily

63
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,190
accessible

64
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,800
that we tried to

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,540
develop together with all the others

66
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,730
of the curatorial staff the idea

67
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,890
of movable type, that is how

68
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,840
movable type at the time initially with

69
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,989
gutenberg served for the same font the

70
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,250
same characters did not serve to

71
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,129
compose many different pages in the

72
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:57,360
same way i  data can be

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,000
composed aggregated to form

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,420
works that concern different areas or

75
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,040
themes therefore from movable type we

76
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,420
have tried to aggregate indeed

77
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,580
all these various subjects have been aggregated that

78
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,739
you see that each brought their own

79
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:14,640
works

80
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,180
obviously these works are the synthesis

81
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,870
of

82
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,480
a series  of data that had been

83
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,030
collected had been identified

84
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,500
within their path  what you

85
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,599
see is the set-up that we have

86
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,799


87
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,940
basically created since the

88
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,299
venice pavilion and semicircular curve more or less

89
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:36,870
we wanted to keep on the wall

90
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,090
entering you enter from the opposite side

91
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,030
this is the view of the exit entering

92
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,099
both on the wall here the whole series

93
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,799
of  movable type fonts and on

94
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,220
the other side instead there are these monitors that

95
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,750
are very large are about six

96
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,359
meters high on which a small video is projected,

97
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,510
small in the sense of

98
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,280
duration and below appear

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,739
infographics that represent the data

100
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,920
that are things that are  let's say exposed

101
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,239
within that case study

102
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,250
mainly we wanted to make an

103
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,739
analysis of the knowledge that was

104
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,480
within the various institutes to the various

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,129
bodies

106
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:17,760
because now I do not know more or less you in the

107
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,260
areas you work but it is fundamental

108
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,329
above all in the same moment in which  we

109
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,250
pass in the transformation from the

110
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,710
paper archive to the digital archive it

111
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,539
is also important to understand how

112
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:28,950
the organization is organized  one what are the

113
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,470
so-called access and sharing policies

114
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,220


115
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,710
what we have noticed is that very

116
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,539
often there are limits of structures

117
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:44,729
dictated from some points of view by

118
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:48,030
the administrative or legal part

119
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,800
paradoxically at this time those who have

120
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,750
the most organized policies are

121
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,449
public bodies  then the regions and the

122
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,729
provinces are common because we say that even with

123
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,260
hammering,

124
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,970


125
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,470
the

126
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,150
universities that should be and that

127
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,280
are in effect a sort of

128
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,500
connector of knowledge and data have been more or less obliged by law to collect and share data  in

129
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,120
turn, paradoxically, they have

130
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,869
difficulties

131
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:17,699
because, due or fortunately to the so-called

132
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,189
freedom of research, researchers

133
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:24,949
are not obliged to share or

134
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,839
enter

135
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,059
the data of their research on the university's servers, so very

136
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:32,669
often the researches and studies that

137
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:33,569
are carried out  within the

138
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,119
university by staff from by

139
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,939
scholars of the university itself  not only

140
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,379
available and they are not in turn

141
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:42,209
shareable therefore in the very moment

142
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,339
in which a devised management system was faced

143
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:45,839
that could, let's say,

144
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,149
share data and allow the use

145
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,740
of knowledge also in academic terms

146
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,639


147
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,089
we had difficulties because

148
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:57,089
precisely the difficulties arise from the fact

149
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:59,369
that  very often people consider

150
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:03,330
the data a sort of work and rough a

151
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,979
kind of shavings that are

152
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,869
left at the base of the sculpture

153
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:09,929
after it has been carved into the wood but what

154
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:12,300
we wanted to say is to bring and

155
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,529
almost turn the concept upside down in the context of

156
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,749
this project of the venice pavilion

157
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:21,300
was to say ok there are works

158
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,870
yes there are documents there

159
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,200
are studies etc.

160
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,100
however the

161
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,750
aggregation research work that will have been

162
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,660
done before is also very important because if it is true that from

163
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,920
an administrative point of view

164
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,200
a  plan that I am of the traffic an

165
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,480
urban plan have a value

166
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,570
we say enacting legal regulations

167
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,240
etc. from the scientific point of view

168
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,060
a paper or a study has an academic impact,

169
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,160
let's say a citability, that is

170
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,500
a scholar becomes more important the

171
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,890
more times his

172
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,230
scientific article is cited there is all the part

173
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,120
of the data, let's say, which instead are those

174
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,060
that can give  extend the life or

175
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,250
expand the knowledge that was collected

176
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,410
within these documents so

177
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,910
what we wanted to try to make people

178
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,040
understand that there is also value in

179
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,660
everything that is done before the

180
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,860
production of the document of the

181
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,530
final works which are precisely  the data these

182
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,410
data, however, and immediately passed the

183
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,750
discussion directly to the management very often they

184
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,420
are not attached or with a license that is you

185
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,700
do not know what can be done if

186
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,010
anyone of you taking them back

187
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,200
can use them for their own works and maybe

188
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,700
these works can be  of

189
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,260
paid jobs and therefore there may be a commercial use

190
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:36,950


191
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,990
at the same time maybe

192
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,300
the half dating is not clear, that is if this

193
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,120
if the  owner of this data and well

194
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,640
identified and this involves a

195
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,700
loss of value both of the

196
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,100
products that are derived

197
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,110
from this information and also a

198
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,300
loss on the part of those who broke the

199
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,040
bales even simply to procure

200
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,840
work to aggregate this knowledge therefore

201
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,750
a '  another of the difficulties that was

202
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,420
the organization and let's say to create this

203
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,000
kind of container a fact to

204
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,860
be distributed this access from which to

205
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,840
draw this information

206
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,000
was to try to make sense and a

207
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,490
reference to those who had, let's say,

208
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,520
tired to do to aggregate these

209
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,860
precisely information the information

210
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,210
becomes in the very moment in which

211
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,970
these data are aggregated

212
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,500
information therefore inside that

213
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,270
I know of an economic paper they become

214
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,480
economic academic training but

215
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,580
perhaps these same data have

216
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,190
geographical value can be transferred

217
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,690
for what it could be at

218
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,280
knowledge of the area and therefore

219
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,870
can  have a value that knows

220
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,420
urban planning these things we have seen

221
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,700
for example on some data that

222
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,940
were produced in this period

223
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,960
within the order of architects

224
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,870
that they tried to do in ii

225
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,600
during this setting up of the

226
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,370
venice pavilion until November they

227
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,170
are doing  a sarre within the

228
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,600
order to try to identify

229
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,150
within the province in this

230
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,640
case of venice what are, let's say,

231
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,700
the points that can be the subject of

232
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,550
an urban redevelopment and it is clear that

233
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,340
this set of information will have an

234
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,080
economic value for professionals

235
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,030
that you will go to work will have an

236
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,250
urban value for the municipalities or

237
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,480
administrations that will be

238
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,720
affected but have a perhaps

239
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,850
social value for those who instead live in

240
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,010
those territories in those areas it is clear

241
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,390
that we are talking about the same

242
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,120
dataset if of this date  if who collected it is not

243
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,610
identified where how

244
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,980
what licenses can be applied for

245
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,920
to be able to do it with a common and clear re-use

246
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,660
that the information risks

247
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,880
being incomplete because you find yourself a

248
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,830
sort of like in the newspapers that you find

249
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,190
at the end of each article information

250
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,890
sorry reproduction

251
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,910
what is written about the reserved reproduction

252
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,920


253
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,420
of jazz in the house written  now I do not

254
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,970
remember that in fact it allows you

255
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,310
to share on social networks as much as possible but

256
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,080
not more than within what

257
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,140
would be the scope of

258
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,460
the discussion thing

259
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,630
this obviously becomes a limit for

260
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,820
example by opening a little let's say more

261
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,890
sector of life at the very moment in

262
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,170
which one enters the activist sphere, i.e.

263
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,550
the archives of newspapers at the

264
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,840
same moment in which they have

265
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,060
reserved reproduction when they become historical elements it

266
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,360
begins to be difficult

267
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,590
especially when perhaps the same

268
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,600
newspapers no longer know whose

269
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,860
ownership the  in case

270
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,510
that is occurring and for example

271
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,339
also with the drive which at this time

272
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:46,870
is no longer published though  there is a

273
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,970
very substantial archive but in fact

274
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,100
it is not accessible you would not know what to

275
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,010
do at the same time you have it

276
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,470
and always in the field of archives and the

277
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,390
venice pavilion we have dealt with it

278
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,950
above all some documents

279
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,320
of the state archive of

280
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,060
venice  further complexities are added

281
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,070
that must be carried out

282
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,769
so it is understood that data management

283
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,930
becomes an increasingly

284
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,110
important issue because if we do not begin

285
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,570
to do we say a sort of data

286
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,890
management

287
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,050
already today even with our own data

288
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,000
at the same moment in which the so-called

289
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,970
increasingly reduced historicization that

290
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,800
is, what we

291
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,170
produced a year ago already becomes history while in

292
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,910
more or less recent years it becomes history

293
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,529
after about ten years now the

294
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,420
historicization time is shortened it

295
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,519
becomes much more difficult to retrieve

296
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,050
the information then live a sort

297
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,300
of stranger  eternal present

298
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,519
the fun thing was also finding

299
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,680
a whole series  of quotations this is

300
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,649
a very particular situation because

301
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,720
it is taken from a letter to the farm by

302
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,910
aldo manuzio so we are false ending

303
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,910
1,500 by tomorrow in

304
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,269
the habit of attaching to one's

305
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:04,690
editions letters that I presented in which I

306
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,370
also

307
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,339
simply thanked the capitalist juventus

308
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:10,899
leaders of the list of the  financier

309
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:13,510
who had materially given him the money and

310
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,880
in this case it was the treasure and the

311
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,680
cornucopia the gardens of adonis which was

312
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,350
a document you look like greek latin

313
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,089
now i don't remember if you did that

314
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,709
we in the net say a lot about it italy the

315
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,990
book diggers free

316
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,640
now free their books from imprisonment and

317
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,959
put them up for sale that he kept

318
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,029
would never happen soon because the

319
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:34,269
strange thing that few, let's say,

320
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:35,880
is rarely told

321
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,820
about Manutius is that he was not in

322
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,890
all respects one of the first

323
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,580
enlightened entrepreneurs but the thing

324
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,550
It is incredible that despite working in Venice

325
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,840
he never had access to the

326
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,820
Marciana, that is, he is not  Marciana never entered

327
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,400
because essentially they did not

328
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,940
want him to copy the texts that were

329
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,860
contained and therefore could print them and

330
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,590
make money with them because the real intuition of

331
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,510
Manutius was not so much that of

332
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,220
being a publisher because when he started

333
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,530
printing  books to distribute knowledge

334
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,640
because that was his

335
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,530
entrepreneurial purpose to make money with the

336
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,860
distribution of knowledge

337
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,730
[Music]

338
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,070
he did not make editions that

339
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,350
were difficult to convey which

340
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,290
instead to the tradition of his own

341
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,490
let's say competitors

342
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,320
so he was very

343
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,630
differentiated because  he made pieces

344
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,490
of very small editions in which there

345
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,470
was no comment and who cared a lot about

346
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,150
the aesthetic aspect of the fonts, that is, they

347
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,590
had to be very beautiful to read,

348
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,510
very easy and that imitated as much as

349
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,900
possible the writing of the

350
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,480
scribes for which he had invested

351
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,780
for example on the script on the

352
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,450
commission of reserved fonts for him

353
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,680
this in fact led her to do

354
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,150
a sort of ante litteram data management

355
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,040
that is, he had identified

356
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,230
a whole series of books that were

357
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,380
perhaps not very widely distributed but important and

358
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,660
that were still at the stage of manuel

359
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,340
so he took these books and

360
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,820
identified them in printed transcripts and there

361
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,670
he began to distribute  at a cost

362
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,800
not so much lower than the others but that it

363
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,420
was more accessible more easily

364
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,880
distributable so from this point of

365
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,150
view he here practically welcomes

366
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,830
the fact that now many texts available for

367
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,680
distribution and since they

368
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,060
were ancient texts and

369
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,220
scribes there are no  they were copyright problems

370
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,570
which instead at the very moment they

371
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,250
entered the press if they could have them

372
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,860
because they were the so-called

373
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,630
patent rights it seems to me that it was he

374
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,740
says in fact he certainly had the desire

375
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,300
for the fact fulfilled today everyone

376
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,220
spontaneously offers their fat manuscripts

377
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,649
and sends them  nor booksellers to sell

378
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,690
them have been sent a lot to

379
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,670
me too I hope it will happen later  even this if

380
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,680
there are individuals so narrow-minded

381
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,480
as to feel sorry for a good that is common to all,

382
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,529


383
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,870
well they burst out of envy

384
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,220
for envy or overwhelmed by pain

385
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,200
they grind unhappiness finally

386
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,240
hang themselves therefore it is to be seen that in

387
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,120
any case the management discourse

388
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,680
of knowledge and access to

389
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,480
knowledge has always been a

390
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,339
rather controversial issue that brought,

391
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,430
let's say, very strong emotions

392
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,310
because precisely the GDP is the key to everything

393
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,079
that underlies the venice pavilion

394
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,760
but also underlies all the

395
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,339
data we manage is  how we want to

396
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:30,149
distribute them that is we compared to those

397
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:32,100
who came before us also in

398
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,540
the IT field

399
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,880
we had the revolution egypt the

400
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,320
tab revolution

401
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,000
if the speech of the verse in the fact that

402
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,100
we could share the code much

403
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,980
more easily and use the concept of

404
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,370
strong and  of

405
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,680
mutual contribution diversification this has

406
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,310
led us to understand the fact that if the

407
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,769
inform  actions the codes knowledge

408
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:57,260
is not distributed under a certain aspect

409
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,399
deprives us of what could be

410
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,860
the recognition of our value

411
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,410
even just an ability to manage it

412
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,170
so the fact of distributing it and knowing

413
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,029
how to distribute it becomes an

414
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,829
important asset both for the professions and

415
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:12,360
for the works that we produce that

416
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,769
are commissioned

417
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:15,300
to us on this point, however, strategy is needed

418
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,790
the strategy consists in understanding whether

419
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,260
within the works that we produce of the

420
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,110
profession we have there

421
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,640
is information that we want to

422
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,680
share because it gives us an

423
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,500
advantage of the information rightly

424
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,260
that we want to keep because they create us

425
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,000
always has an advantage we say

426
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,579
position models business models

427
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,040
on this we say there are more and more

428
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,290
distribution models a model a

429
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,630
framework that we habitually

430
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,100
have also applied in the

431
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,560
venice pavilion is the

432
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,690
she is dead  by osterwalder the business

433
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,240
model canvas that I don't know q  hen you

434
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,710
can know and that has in

435
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,180
turn been remodeled by the creative commons

436
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,180
foundation to which they have added

437
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,980
within all the various

438
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,510
distribution schemes also what could

439
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,569
be

440
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,880
the type of licenses with which you want to

441
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,579
share the data and above all also

442
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,619
the level of responsibility to a

443
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,970
social pact that you want to have the

444
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,819
distribution because precisely all

445
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,189
together the very moment in which I associate

446
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:23,980
the aggregation of information,

447
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,079
their description and how they want to

448
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,240
distribute them becomes precisely this

449
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,830
same generation of value the

450
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,690
value that concerns everyone in the  The scope

451
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,490
of the venice pavilion concerned that I know

452
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,179
the municipality of venice meant the employees

453
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:39,009
and the individual offices who burden the data and

454
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:41,590
who used and still use these

455
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,649
data to represent their work

456
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:47,080
in the specific case of the pavilion

457
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,570
many urban planning data were used which

458
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,570
were the description  of the maps and

459
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,299
historical photos that have now become

460
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,190
historical  urban planning archive

461
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,059
there is essentially photos of documentation

462
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,299
such as what I know happens work on

463
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:05,860
a new road the technicians of the municipality

464
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,720
have always gone to take photos as the

465
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,250
works were carried out

466
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,889
the fact is that the archives of the

467
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:14,110
municipality of Venice contain  even many

468
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,740
previous years and therefore there were the photos

469
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,210
of the municipal employees that he sent to

470
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,460
photograph the states of the

471
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,049
bombing trenches that were during the

472
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:25,059
first a second world war here in

473
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:27,519
mestre or in the historic center so

474
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,110
these data are administrative data

475
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,570
become very important to historical data and data

476
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,919
to see how

477
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:36,429
the territory has transformed,

478
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:38,649
all because the basis is in any case the

479
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:40,000
quote by calvino on

480
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,289
invisible cities that is that even the cities

481
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:43,629
grow from being the work of the mind of the

482
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:48,039
case, that is, they are not always palaces or

483
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,840
structures but they are personally people

484
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,779
who work and think and each of

485
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:55,210
these people creates their own product

486
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,340
a prop  rio thought and tries to

487
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,850
leave its mark the point is precisely the

488
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,850
answer to a question in the case of the

489
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,830
venice pavilion we have tried to give

490
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,919
an answer to the question but why

491
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,870
all these various successes or with marco

492
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,090
better how can all these various

493
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:17,049
subjects produce a  'unitary or

494
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:20,860
at least coherent idea of the city the first

495
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,720
answer we had tried to give is

496
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,730
that in the meantime you

497
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,649
agree on how to share the

498
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:29,350
information from there after you can

499
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,639
find a common language and

500
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:34,690
develop a city and here I am

501
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:45,429
done  fantola questions boh

502
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:50,879
there are perfect questions
