1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
yes yes how everyone sorry for the

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,170
situation but we managed with lte cellular bridges to

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:15,330
make gaps on

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,990
missing connections anyway to have the slides of

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,490
what he will talk about in this presentation today he

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,380
will talk about online fraud and

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,050
what we have seen a little during various

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,800
years of analysis  obviously

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,179
different problems this was taken

10
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,790
from one of our courses that we do to

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,969
banks in Italy

12
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,620
we have removed several slides because

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,500
we usually show

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,239
negative information to botnets and

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,850
other internal aspects of botnets that have

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,910
been identified over time with

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,070
specific aspects of the individual institute which, however,

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,410
have been removed from this

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,800
presentation

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,100
obviously the opinions expressed are

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,250
only from the author that I am

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,700
the blackburn technician remains security

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,439
that a company focused on

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,659
application security I have been doing the

25
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,310
penetration test for about 11 years

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,400
I really like finding and fixing

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,900
vulnerabilities in software  like by

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,220
the way to several who are in this

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,620
room and I have been

30
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,230
working with texon fraud teams since

31
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,430
about 2010 what will

32
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,290
this presentation talk about this

33
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,970
presentation will talk about criminal

34
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,730
business

35
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,080
obviously crime in business and you

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:52,860
said it's my fault me  listen criminal

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,450
business will talk about users who

38
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,020
help attackers to get

39
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,310
inside their own

40
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,270
machine we have seen from around 1995

41
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,840
a fair a fair series of

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,610
events that have led to an increase

43
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,380
in the complexity of the attacks

44
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,750
here we see a series of attacks  which

45
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,130
were non-profit up to,

46
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,380
for example, all the attack

47
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,500
carried out by the

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,940
gonzalez gang I do not know if you followed but

49
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,130
the aspects of heartland payment in

50
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,670
by now what it is in the distant 2000 and

51
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,020
2008 relative to  the fact that

52
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,180
even if about 110

53
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,850
million credit cards were stolen using

54
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,610
an international network of people, among

55
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,290
other things gonzalez  he was an informant of the

56
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,600
fbi that this person who is here

57
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,670
connected to a whole series of people

58
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,460
among other things also some of tails including

59
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,320
terrorist unixes who had written the

60
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,030
rootkit which was then put

61
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,070
inside heartland payment

62
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,120
by the  which they siphoned into the cd in about

63
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,120
a year these 110 million cards and

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,750
let's say that from the gonzalez hack that

65
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,900
all one was born from a problematic of

66
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,760
if of sure injection found by one of

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,850
their Russian correspondents because they had

68
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,970
used this this Russian hacker who

69
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,100
found the vulnerability

70
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,040
basically it is a whole series of

71
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,860
similar problems that have occurred

72
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,459
over time to reach adults who

73
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:46,480
in our days with a series of

74
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,910
memorable hacks within the

75
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,390
financial security landscape

76
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,620
I do not know if you know this

77
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,500
character he and alexander panin

78
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,310
who  spy eye author you know spy eye

79
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,080
as malware it is a kind of virus from

80
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,689
which it

81
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:10,069
got many features such as

82
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:12,010
the forum cra bin  go or the ability to

83
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,269
steal credentials within the

84
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:17,410
forums and

85
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,720
he at one point was precisely

86
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,190
arrested by interpol

87
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:27,550
when he was in algeria this is in vogue

88
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,150
what is the zeus autor law so much

89
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,100
so that this is one of the people  which

90
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,310
became extremely wealthy through

91
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,560
lele creep currencies but in addition to

92
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,920
zeus we owe the creation of zeus

93
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,760
peer to peer

94
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,710
that is the peer to peer version of zeus but

95
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,530
also crypto locker so much so that the

96
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,930
fda and then found the keys of criticism  was

97
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,180
within the servers used

98
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,110
by boxers that had previously

99
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,140
been used for the management of the

100
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,320
botnet decisive speer to peer

101
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,430
this is a very capable user of

102
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,500
the creations of the precedents for

103
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,330
which she was accused and then also

104
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,540
condemned in relation to the  use of

105
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,110
the zeus trojan for

106
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,620
hacking activities theft from users

107
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,720
let's say that there has been from 2016 until

108
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,330
now a strong change in the

109
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,700
frost economy is that of

110
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,900
colo  ro who do fraud

111
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,720
this because as you can see from the

112
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,150
numbers this is an extract from the

113
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,100
confirmation of the keynote by alan paller of the

114
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,220
sans institute a rsa conference

115
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,530
practically about 170 million

116
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,700
credit cards were stolen in 2014

117
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,320
if 61 million were stolen on

118
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,900
170 million credit card holders and

119
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,250
about 450 million sd century security

120
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,260
numbers of social security numbers

121
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,370
were stolen during the pm hack and

122
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,290
a similar fate also had

123
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,120
that of the voters this means that

124
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,660
the information relating to aiac

125
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,810
online

126
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,050
these is extremely easy to access.

127
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,410
finding extremely easy information

128
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,830
led to an increase in

129
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,870
anti-fraud analyzes that were done through

130
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,729
the correlation of the utd and the

131
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:32,710
inappropriate use of this information

132
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,770
so much so that for example one of the

133
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,490
companies that was deputy to

134
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,190
transaction security is here faxing

135
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,919
precisely to the analysis of the possible

136
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:46,990
fraudulent use of stolen data here are

137
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,760
the faxes c  as you know

138
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,919
about two years ago it was hacked and a

139
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:54,250
lot of data was stolen by

140
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,720
siri by the anti-fraud system itself

141
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,389
talking about the roadster strategy

142
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,720
given to all this availability of

143
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,460
stolen data available online

144
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,630
within db but also if

145
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,260
within the darknet channels  private,

146
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,190
the return on investment of a

147
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,820
possible attack

148
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,830
strongly depends on some parameters 1

149
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,000
surely it is how long the frogster or

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,440
whoever conducts the fraud can remain

151
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,380
can remain stealth or

152
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,390
unidentifiable traceable once

153
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,250
the fraud has been carried out and then above all in

154
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,670
relation to the reusability

155
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,630
of the  attack that has identified

156
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,600
many of the attacks are specific

157
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,450
so they are to be carried out

158
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:54,480
against a possible

159
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,210
target while others are reusable

160
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,430
such as those of malware for

161
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,750
which just change the configuration

162
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,670
can be used in various

163
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,210
contexts

164
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,430
this is an example of broken access

165
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,500
control a typical a typical

166
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,080
vulnerability where, for example, the

167
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,530
function of execution of the

168
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,630
payment dl should be protected by

169
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,700
a functionality 22 factors

170
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,550
the authentication however this has been

171
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,920
mistakenly placed within the

172
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,910
part authorized by the session only,

173
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,280
so much so that the theft of the

174
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,909
session

175
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,849
this attack is  feasible because

176
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,490
the third authentication factor can be bypassed

177
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,020
obviously this

178
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,490
type of activity search for

179
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,380
vulnerabilities can only be exploited

180
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,570
towards the credit institution or

181
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,060
the system affected by this specific

182
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,550
vulnerability not like malware that

183
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,610
can be used against a

184
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,470
large number of systems  in relation to the atac

185
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,630
partner of fedi fusion and distribution

186
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,590
this is an extract from the verizon data

187
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,270
breach report in 2015

188
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,320
the web attacks are as

189
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,740
always in net increase

190
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,310
if you see that is they follow a certain one there is

191
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,260
a certain increase over  even the

192
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,360
malware ones

193
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,190
obviously all worked  a much

194
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,920
better when, as always,

195
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,510
users also help attackers

196
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,710
because basically even the

197
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,440
most effective authentication solutions are

198
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,300
vulnerable to users

199
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,339
helping attackers in some way

200
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:38,940
because

201
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,460
many think that most

202
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,560
fraud is conducted with explore  the

203
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,460
stream with a sophisticated mind in reality

204
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,980
most of it is conducted

205
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,080
using sophisticated patterns, however, which

206
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,160
depend on conditions for which

207
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,160
the user is defrauded user can

208
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,630
also be the bank operator but in any case

209
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,640
the user of a particular system or

210
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,750
portal such as  the attackers bypass the

211
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,550
factor authentication to factor

212
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,870
authentication so I took a while but

213
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,110
if they came tt are the passwords l

214
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,630
scratch card over time the time based

215
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:22,200
of sdp stacks are the skies response cap

216
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,570
the authentic cards shaun protocol and the

217
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,290
sms challenges the  authentication by

218
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,260
phone call etc. etc.

219
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,780
obviously there are models and some

220
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,970
aspects of traitement des linger

221
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,720
that go to try to identify

222
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,200
how

223
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,970
a possible user is attacked but all

224
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,830
this is quite complex let's say to

225
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:52,830
simplify the users are protected by

226
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,720
discretionary controls what does

227
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,610
a discretionary control mean something

228
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,649
that is delegated to the institute of

229
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:04,610
credit that is the fact that a bank transfer

230
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,670
has an incorrect iban while the

231
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,320
other data are correct and

232
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,640
an information for the

233
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,440
interbank specifications that he saw must be

234
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,970
verified by the institution never

235
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,920
the institution that must verify the

236
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,540
correspondence of the iban to  a

237
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,500
specific recipient that is if one

238
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,050
sends you a bank transfer with your iban and

239
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,610
the receiving institution that you verify

240
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,370
the iban is actually corresponding

241
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,880
to the name ok then this check is

242
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,060
done by the bank what happens

243
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,410
in your opinion how many users when they make

244
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,870
a transaction check the  their imam

245
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,279
that is actually what they

246
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,510
had inserted durant  and the

247
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,779
previous transaction probably some do

248
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:54,089
but most when they see

249
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,620
the correct name the exact amount they

250
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,450
click ok they make the transfer go ahead

251
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,070
this basically

252
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,740
defeats the functionality of any

253
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,450
strong authentication system because

254
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,400
what the malware simply has to do

255
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,870
is take  the previous iban

256
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,190
this is your computer

257
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,230
the malware gets in the way modifies

258
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,300
the iban and then passes it with an

259
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,940
indifferent vat the attacker chooses a

260
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,980
credit institution where he is conniving

261
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,170
or knows that they are not true and does not do this

262
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,270
discretionary control and is calm

263
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,160
on the fact of receiving and the possible

264
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,700
remediation because obviously it is the

265
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,320
credit institution that receives the good

266
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,770
the five must check the attack

267
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,810
can be seen in a

268
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,600
sophisticated way that is, over time the

269
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,779
numerous  systems inside

270
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,760
computers but on various operating systems from

271
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,329
mac os windows linux etc that

272
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:54,180
simply do something like this  a when one

273
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,390
makes the

274
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,000
specific copy of a certain string

275
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,590
they do the levent sec

276
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,360
or check that it is an ivan

277
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,800
because iban is a bit like credit cards

278
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,230
can be there are codes

279
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,150
inside that check if an ivan is

280
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,940
correct or  minus and verifies that liman is

281
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,000
correct if the string and an

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,490
iban monitor the clipboard if the

283
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,950
clipboard contains an iban they modify it

284
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,720
with one of the banks they check them

285
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,280
so when one copies and pastes

286
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,890
a possible iban one finds that he makes a

287
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,990
transfer to  an imam who is not the previous one

288
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,400


289
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,440
obviously this situation has

290
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,360
also been replicated within the crete

291
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,790
currencies because why not do the same

292
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,270
thing to a crypto address these

293
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,590
are addresses and you withdraw one and bitcoin

294
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:44,620
this is the code taken from ex reiss that

295
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,970
checks in loop that the

296
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,030
clipboard contains any addresses by

297
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,900
monitoring more and more addresses they

298
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,110
verify that any address is

299
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,690
possibly one of that  there that sky

300
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,250
presents the inside of the clipboard the

301
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,600
crypto clip hijacker goes to check

302
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,060
even 2.3 million addresses

303
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,320
crypto cure itself to verify if one of

304
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,000
these executives the boards to be able to

305
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,880


306
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,610
basically replace it as you can see that is

307
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,710
all the security solutions from

308
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,840
some non  some way they are

309
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,400
vulnerable to malware because the logical ex plate

310
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,400
is to go and have

311
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,290
the user approve the

312
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,680
wrong transaction if we go and see what

313
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,660
the user does here the user will find a certain

314
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,790
point that says via  his solution

315
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,500
of authentic divers shows that this

316
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,270
is a text message etc. enter the code

317
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,880
or press the button to

318
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,200
make the transaction go through

319
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,750
but what he has underneath is

320
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,410
something wrong

321
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,040
obviously

322
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,120
this aspect also takes a bit of

323
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,829
connivance  then of the

324
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:59,870
banking institution which then comes to be in

325
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,199
some way complicit in the fact of

326
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,639
not making the correct checks between the

327
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,339
correspondence  enza between iban and user there are

328
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,230
other types of attack but this

329
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,720
last year between ch tonica and a whole

330
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,209
series of other malware was

331
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:15,860
something extremely annoying because in

332
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,410
any case your bank sees

333
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,160
the transfer out to the third institution then

334
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,769
these  they can be successful or not,

335
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:27,440
however from a certain point of view a

336
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,089
certain percentage is successful and for

337
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:31,160
the attacker it is a very limited network

338
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,470
because it is enough to go and look for the iban

339
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,740
possibly return it another

340
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,930
method of fraud that you know anyway

341
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,699
and that of phishing phishing

342
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:43,279
from a certain point of view is something

343
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,449
always known is something banal

344
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:48,680
above all it is interesting the way

345
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,829
in which if it were to go and see

346
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:54,339
the impact function meanwhile and

347
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:56,870
opening you know you need the

348
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,449
impact function no that is the  made to see for

349
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:02,149
each hour what is the number of openings

350
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:06,769
that one receives, it has been seen that the e-mails

351
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:09,290
sent at night time are

352
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,880
pressing because one is gua  rdando the

353
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,329
movie on netflix while watching your

354
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:16,310
computer are the most read so it

355
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,130
happens that the person opens the email

356
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,480
without paying much attention

357
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,339
about joining percent they click on

358
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:29,120
attachments but the best attack

359
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,790
when perth attack occurs

360
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,120
dvd a spammer so to speak perfect

361
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,389
or in case a friend has

362
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:42,410
cleared up the spam email

363
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,459
this is a touch ment that comes from

364
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:48,139
rotary request sent by

365
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,639
the rotary secretariat to all

366
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:53,120
rotary members this year happened in March

367
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,509
about of  a provincial section not

368
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:58,920
from Italy but they hacked

369
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,589
a person inside the section

370
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:03,930
and sent all members a

371
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,140
doc document called rotary

372
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,059
request doc from the real

373
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,030
secretary who sent it to everyone

374
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,290
if you were a member

375
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,449
of the  'association you would have opened the

376
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:18,470
document or not,

377
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:25,470
that is, this was this thing,

378
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,419
in short, not everyone has opened it because

379
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:28,679
I have come to know  cenza

380
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:29,940
because they called me and they told me you have

381
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,490
arrived a strange document

382
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,290
we open it and this file has been

383
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,120
written this file was created with

384
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,919
a present version of microsoft word

385
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,990
then they downloaded a

386
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,340
present version of microsoft word they

387
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,650
opened it if it has  always written a version

388
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,330
present in microsoft so they

389
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,650
understood that there was something wrong

390
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,429
but basic what happened that

391
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:52,080
a whole series of freelancers of

392
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,330
companies etc. have seen a

393
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,160
request from the secretariat that sent

394
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,020
a request document but they have it

395
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,549
open to see what this document

396
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,140
contained or the

397
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,520
secretaries who opened it have turned you

398
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,140
consider that the number of

399
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,549
interlocutors within a company

400
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:08,790
is much higher than the only

401
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,679
recipient of the emails because then there are

402
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,510
the secretaries there are alleles others

403
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,690
people who who are inside then

404
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,710
simply very trivial mail see

405
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,830
attachment see attachment and confirm

406
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,660
ropes  greetings doctor name surname

407
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,540
who sent it more with the touch

408
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,669
while personalized this was a

409
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:36,090
sniff trojan as you well know a

410
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,390
banking trojan capable of interacting with the

411
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,389
banking sites

412
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:44,869
of which the user goes to visit with the

413
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:47,829
draw for c  'it was, etc., therefore basic

414
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:50,469
activity focused on possibly

415
00:18:50,469 --> 00:18:53,719
stealing the money of the professionals who

416
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,849
would then subsequently use

417
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:58,359
the current account

418
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:01,159
this is not the only way with which we

419
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:03,200
usually try to install human

420
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,809
is very popular are the drive by download

421
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:09,379
then download  guided these every

422
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:11,179
time someone goes to see a

423
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:13,190
football match or goes to a home

424
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,829
cinema looking for a movie they

425
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:17,869
are often asked by the installations on the

426
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:20,289
browser of plugins and other things that are

427
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:22,909
are effective techniques to

428
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:24,679
install that is one thinks that

429
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:27,709
most of the installations are

430
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,629
done via explore instead most

431
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:31,039
of the installations are done

432
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,839
using  or relatively

433
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,479
trivial tricks that the user falls for this

434
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:37,820
is also a long-term investment

435
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,799
because while the exploits at some

436
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:42,109
point for some reason are dropped

437
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:44,359
you find the ex plate you have been

438
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:46,249
working on for a lifetime you make it more beautiful

439
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:48,019
as possible as an underlay someone

440
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,209
else finds it vellucci gift a technique of

441
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,039
this type if done well officials

442
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,169
works and will work forever

443
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:58,249
so basically it becomes a mode that can then

444
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:00,320
also be brought to mobile as in

445
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,079
this case this is a mobile drive

446
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:05,719
drive by download  of the infection

447
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:07,309
campaigns that can also be done

448
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,039
using the pe of social networks here

449
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,659
you see a plugin integration is a

450
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:14,089
bit old but this here was of a

451
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:17,990
plugin for skype that sent

452
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:23,240
a certain malicious attachment to the entire skype address book

453
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,750
so one finds

454
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,830
these things you can do fine

455
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,390
with telegraph i dont know if you have ever used

456
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,090
telegram

457
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,100
command line interpreter interpreter that

458
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,140
use the np protocol you can take

459
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,570
if you have access to an address book the

460
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,130
user's credentials you can

461
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,480
connect to all the groups of this

462
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,390
user send a touch while to all

463
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,130
to all his contacts

464
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:55,530
obviously social engineering there

465
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,960
are exploits that is a whole  series

466
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,800
of tools that are developed

467
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,870
to make automatic installations

468
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,400
using zero day or

469
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,190
possibly even

470
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,540
relatively recent explores this is an

471
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,370
example of an old exploit for flash

472
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,340
but basically in here no

473
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,520
user interaction is needed so for  to which by

474
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,480
opening a possible website, blended techniques are

475
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,030
automatically punctured

476
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,040
and within

477
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,470
well-known sites they bring a higher return on

478
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,970
investment.

479
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,280


480
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,250


481
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,730
deployed the site from miss

482
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,250
ii an iframe was added within

483
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,120
the site

484
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,820
then an own iframe was added

485
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,950
the night of the super bowl for which all

486
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,810
those who went to see the

487
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,800
abc.com site had this iframe

488
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,020
within the site for which they would have

489
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,660
loaded the king of exploited kits and then

490
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,850
installed site that a variant of the

491
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:08,160
known banker virus of variants

492
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,340
includes the  sms phishing this is also

493
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,830
something that happens often but

494
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,750
above all because mobile users

495
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,550
find it hard to see when they click

496
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,440
on the links what the name of the site is so it

497
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,450
arrives at the sms they click on

498
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,580
the address it is not understood very well or it

499
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,320
is opened to the  inside a web view

500
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,440
is a certain point it is effective

501
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,800
malvertising and the technique whereby

502
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,360


503
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,640


504
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,720
malicious content is put inside some advertisement broadcasting system

505
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,300
this happened to me on some

506
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,269
Italian newspaper nest sites for which

507
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:47,139
even people going  to read

508
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:50,539
some articles for the morning either they

509
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:53,659
wake up and go to see the newspaper

510
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:55,309
or they go to the office and look at

511
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,409
the article on their own  I daily

512
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,259
trust if there is any interaction

513
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,269
with javascript to joints within

514
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:05,929
the open ex platforms which then

515
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:07,789
advertise them are pitcher states and

516
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:09,619
ideas of standard sasa platforms are used

517
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:13,129
to be able to

518
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:15,139
spread them but it happens when

519
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:16,369
a contribution is made  malicious that all those

520
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:18,889
who see that content are

521
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:21,469
basically infected it happened to me with a

522
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:22,879
user who got infected with spy

523
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:25,099
eye this is some time ago but he

524
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,719
went to see a certain content

525
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:31,759
on Italian newspaper banking malware

526
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,019
banking malware there  there are many types

527
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:40,129
which are the steps of the early malware

528
00:23:40,129 --> 00:23:42,589
obviously first infection then

529
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:43,519
identity theft

530
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,859
data collection preparation for

531
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,659
caching out and then auto caching

532
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,369
actually means that

533
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:52,940
the victim's money is stolen this was

534
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,649
a  an example of when we had been looking for

535
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:59,329
this is a while ago in 2015 to

536
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:01,249
do a mapping of the

537
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:03,589
pr features  free in the various banking malware which,

538
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:06,709
however, somehow over time

539
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:10,039
have become uniform but here you can see

540
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,850
that the various plugins

541
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,030
were present once as they are

542
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,830
now that is the incredible thing that

543
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,660
deprives banking malware

544
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,360
if one thinks zius col to me the thing  which

545
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,280
amazes me more than zeus and that when

546
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,850
virus came out on the first

547
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:32,590
portals it cost about 1500 bitcoins

548
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,110
now you know 1500 bitcoins how

549
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,980
much they are worth as

550
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,240
long as you do just do the math no

551
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,200
no bitcoins about 6,800 dollars

552
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,350
so those who have not converted

553
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,170
those ones  bitcoin that they had at the

554
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,620
time are very wealthy in short,

555
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,280
the various authors but also the sellers and

556
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,680
the features that you see that

557
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,450
were added over time for

558
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,550
better or worse are the same

559
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,220
now perhaps the newest one is the

560
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,720
one I showed  before with regard

561
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,020
to the iban swat

562
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,790
another very popular feature

563
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,510
that has been seen with the datec pattern is that

564
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,250
of the remote control of the

565
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,350
user desktop  te dai recar barak

566
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,790
basically the fact of using

567
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:28,440
the user not only as

568
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,600


569
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,640
in passive mode if we want to

570
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,470
enter the data and then these were

571
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,420
sent to a data center but

572
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,350
actively use the user's computer

573
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,060
as a bridge to then carry out the

574
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,560
malicious transactions this from a

575
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,770
fraud point of view created a series of

576
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,990
challenges identifying the buyers

577
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,090
because dyer was actually using the

578
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,070
same computer as the user or imagine

579
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,930
that the user connects with a certain

580
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,120
point the attacker connects as a

581
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,640
proxy  and as the same screen to the

582
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,860
user's computer and it is the user

583
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,860
himself who then goes to fraud

584
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,450
himself from his own ip from his

585
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:14,470
own computer first to ok sorry

586
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,840
nothing I did too many slides nothing

587
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,140


588
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:24,260
then the evolution of the  bank the malware has

589
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,430
been has been very has been very fast

590
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,420
there have been and this for example is a

591
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,900
a a botnet where transactions

592
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,270
are carried out automatically

593
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,700
we were  managed to have zeus peer

594
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,380
to peer one of the inter-phase control

595
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,420
that you see in real time the users

596
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,340
who connect these users

597
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,370
download that then imagine this care

598
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,810
in the creation of the

599
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,970
control interface for which it is very long mental

600
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,010
but all the  users connect

601
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,200
take the data these are the of the

602
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,180
users of the various banks who

603
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,830
are connected to the system they see

604
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,650
a setting then to obscure they

605
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,990
put which settings to make

606
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,510
the transfer and automatically

607
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,730
the transfer was made to

608
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,030
the  web attacker in gex tandem attacks

609
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,420
etc.

610
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,300
to conclude what what can I tell you

611
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,870
basically I went a bit long

612
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,060
because I could not immediately

613
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,180
start the presentation but

614
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,610
do not feel safe using

615
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,980
your banking systems be very

616
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,380
careful who has the  various attachments what

617
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,180
is sent because these all

618
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,280
solutions to fail for users that shaun

619
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,050
giving you ist  Banking money can be

620
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,630
bypassed in some way so the

621
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,250
most important thing is to

622
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,980
identify any anomaly

623
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,310
in what the transactions are,

624
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,130
these are concrete iban currencies and if

625
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,110
between etcetera why remember the

626
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,930
credit cards are insured so if

627
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,460
something happens to you all  'inside the

628
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,110
credit cards within 20 days

629
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,270
you make the complaint or the one you

630
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,950
communicate to the bank immediately they

631
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,410
shout all the money if they steal

632
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,270
five hundred thousand euros from your current account

633
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,100
even if someone asks you but how is it

634
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,870
possible that they steal 500 thousand euros

635
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,180
against the current they succeed  even to steal

636
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,160
500 thousand euros from your current account depends on

637
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,100
how well the attackers are prepared

638
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,080
to do that particular

639
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,210
activity they must study well

640
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,700
how the possible limits that the

641
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,190
bank work and among a series of things, however,

642
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,020
basic the speech

643
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,360
was attentive to anomalies  if you have

644
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,250
some information activate the sms

645
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,530
go and see what v  i inform the

646
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,800
bank if there is anything you

647
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,870
communicate and try to block that

648
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,610
transaction as soon as possible because the

649
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,890
thefts on current accounts are not

650
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,600
necessarily covered by insurance i.e. you

651
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,130
risk going into litigation here in

652
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,980
court and then not having your

653
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,350
money back

654
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:02,160
ok then  basically I wanted to show you

655
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,110
other examples but actually I

656
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,040
went for a long time

657
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,960
thanks

658
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:21,219
