1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
I am roberto I wanted to tell you about a

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,750
project with your self on tesla coil

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,370
that was a very long birth because it

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,220
is something whose pieces were years

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,460
lying at home and that

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,070
I quickly concluded this summer

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,259
finally found the motivation a bit

8
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,509
of desire in  vacation to develop

9
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:31,029
things for ideas matured over

10
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:35,829
time and it is the usual we call the usual

11
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:38,290
lightning generating machine with a

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,640
bit of new ideas in the project is not

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,850
a record machine from those you

14
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,769
see movies one meter two meters of

15
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:50,470
spark in short, however, in short, it makes

16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,860
its lightning strikes

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,840
I wanted to tell you a little about how it is made

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,929
maybe by telling a moment before

19
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:01,719
a hint of how they work because

20
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,320
now

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,839
I suppose that there are not many

22
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,110
electronic more softwarists some

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:16,060
other ok then the appearance that you see

24
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,190
of the  tesla coil is usually this

25
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,250
column with a lot of coiled and

26
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,130
enameled copper with attachments sometimes attached

27
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,530
over a painful hat as it is

28
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,189
called a a  in short, from

29
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:31,780
which the lightning strikes,

30
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,890
in fact, the principle is that of the

31
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,159
transformer, i.e. a

32
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,250
primary winding as you can see drawn

33
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,320
there on the left of a few turns a

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,510
very large secondary winding which,

35
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,540
however, uses the resonance principle of

36
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:55,390
the resonance of

37
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,880
electronic circuits.  which is a bit similar if

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,970
you want to the resonance of the pendulum,

39
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,729
arms and mass, in short, so if you

40
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:06,010
bring a circuit right to its

41
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,320
resonant frequency with little effort

42
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,690
you can bring it to a

43
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,430
very high voltage within the limits of the

44
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,770
insulation that is not  everything is broken

45
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,020
in order to be able to obtain these

46
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,989
high tensions, however, it is necessary to

47
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,760
make a winding on a single tube

48
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,980
with a single layer of style because

49
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,350
otherwise the tensions that so others

50
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,959
would create internal discharges and in a

51
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,239
few words everything would break as

52
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,130
well as the works  primary chin the one that

53
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,360
excites must be a little distant

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,390
from the secondary and at  in this it

55
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,400
differs a little from the conventional transformer,

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,630


57
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,500
however, compared to the

58
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,360
conventional transformer, very high voltages are obtained

59
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,739
which are suitable for

60
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,640
experiments so with a

61
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,090
relative effort here are types of tesla that you

62
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,090
see around are

63
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,850
mainly divided between those with pulses that

64
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,709
generate single  discharges just the

65
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,269
lightning like the one

66
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:17,110
I built and those that generate a

67
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:22,010
continuous dump in the air

68
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,310
that lend themselves for example if you

69
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,650
happen to see the flame that

70
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,810
makes music making music in short, the musical text in the

71
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,310
context of those  impulsive the most

72
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,500
classic what nikola tesla had done

73
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,190
in short is the first scheme that you

74
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,360
see above

75
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,640
uses a high voltage transformer

76
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,840
that goes to charge a

77
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,950
capacitor when the voltage becomes

78
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,810
sufficiently high a

79
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,239
spark bursts on that on that discharger

80
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,450
the spark cup and  the capacitor

81
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,840
composes a resonant circuit with

82
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,420
the primary winding being t  ut high the high

83
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,760
voltage of the capacitor goes but

84
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,150
stimulate secondary and then instead there

85
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,430
are the active versions made with tubes or

86
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,798
semiconductors and I have highlighted a

87
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:27,490
few things the valve circuit is

88
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,970
generally a liberated oscillator use

89
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,330
the tube as an amplifier to

90
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,060
produce  power on the

91
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,830
primary voice and to obtain the tense effect

92
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,810
it takes bros valves and in short

93
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:48,040
actually or they are

94
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,290
the most widespread as modern circuits

95
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,080
use half-bridges or

96
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,050
igbt mosfet bridges with a double variant as

97
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,000
you see in the two circuits depending on whether  'is

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,720
the capacitor in series a to the primary or

99
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,150
no single resonance or double resonance

100
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,200
the secondary winding is always the

101
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,950
same I have not said it before

102
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,480
a dotted capacitor is drawn

103
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,860
there is not physically this capacitor

104
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,990
resonates on the same parasitic capacitances it

105
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,880
transpires exhales  you can imagine the capacity of the

106
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,860
hat you put on it by

107
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,630
returning to

108
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,350
the association of the pendulum that d  I first saw a pendulum

109
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,750
you can imagine it as a thin high

110
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,820
and a mass placed below

111
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,830
or the classic compound pendulum which

112
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,880
is only a rod oscillates the same the

113
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,650
mass is distributed instead of being

114
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,950
all of it at the end and is in any case a

115
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:53,410
secondary oscillator therefore it is always

116
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,390
resonant  and it has a frequency of depends

117
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,740
on how we built it its

118
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,330
resonant frequency

119
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,220
we must adapt to use

120
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,890
that resonant

121
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:07,390
frequency the third pilot directly

122
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,960
the primary winding pumping energy

123
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,850
that frequency

124
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,310
average results are obtained not such

125
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,720
powerful machines in  this way, however, is

126
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,590
simpler to do

127
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,490
if there is a further resonance on the

128
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,010
primary made with that lc

129
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,890
series circuit which then if you see there is also in the

130
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,490
classic one because it is a bit similar to the first

131
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,190
circuit the classic one

132
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,000
in this case it is possible to  obtaining

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,760
higher power discharges, however,

134
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,680
a little more delicate to do because

135
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,410
the two resonance  and of the primary of the

136
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,210
secondary must

137
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,610
get along

138
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,770
because the pendulum as the place when

139
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,229
we go to recite it if we want the

140
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:58,300
motion to amplify or as when

141
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,479
we swing we must excite with the

142
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:04,090
same natural frequency of our

143
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,050
pendulum when we  we have a game 2 the

144
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,050
first must work on the same

145
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,840
frequency as the second but going a

146
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,990
little more on the circuit the

147
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,520
real model that cannot be found in front of the

148
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,020
two coupled inductances this is

149
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,389
mine for example in practice the

150
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:30,610
turns ratio between the primary that there is  is around the

151
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,400
secondary is 34 but approximately the

152
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,080
resistance of the primary winding the

153
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,939
resistance of the secondary winding

154
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:40,659
the equivalent parasitic capacitance the

155
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:43,110
capacitor that I put on the input

156
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,139
when a discharge occurs the discharge

157
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,569
absorbs power so it is as if there

158
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,740
were a  new increases the capacity

159
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,569
because it increases

160
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:58,029
the area that is involved it is as if the

161
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,500
hair becomes larger than by way of

162
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,539
d  in the ionized air and in addition there is an

163
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:04,770
absorption of energy

164
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,529
here we go straight to this last one that

165
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:13,310
I built

166
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,490
[Music]

167
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,380
the idea

168
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,750
obviously belongs to the category of

169
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,270
double igbt resonance and here you see

170
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,480
in fact the output circuit the coil

171
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,330
the circuit  primary with the capacitor

172
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:40,429
the igbt the a pilot of the objectives an

173
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,409
electronic component a

174
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,339
power driver to control the mosfet igbt

175
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:52,220
sorry that manages the bad bank that is

176
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,589
to make sure that there is an area

177
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:55,480
of respect

178
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,400
these two conduct alternately ok

179
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,510
for for  generate the wave that enters

180
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,750
towards the primary winding

181
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,589
when they conduct alternately

182
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:07,790
you have to be careful that they do not conduct

183
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,470
together in short, here is the logic he

184
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,320
wanted to implement within a

185
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,940
programmable logic and the operation is

186
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,200
based on the measurement of the current that

187
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,790
I am going to send inside  the

188
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,980
primary winding a current transformer

189
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,089
which is used for meanwhile to

190
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,490
detect overcurrents to succeed  to

191
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,310
stop everything if the current

192
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,200
is likely to become destructive for

193
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,089
my gbt and then to detect the sign of

194
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,000
this current then this is because

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,930
I

196
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,860
immediately show a figure here this is a

197
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,130
real measurement made when the oscilloscope

198
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,500
of the current inside the

199
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,480
'primary winding when the

200
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,600
circuit starts it turns on the shows

201
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,320
above and the current starts it makes a piece

202
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,570
of sine wave oscillation

203
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,000
when I detect that the current has gone back

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,370
down and passed through zero winter

205
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,529
I turn on the one below which gives me a

206
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:21,899
new shot a  a little bit stronger it comes back

207
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,149
up I switch on the one above and then every

208
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,580
hit I give it the current gets a little

209
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,529
bit stronger until

210
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,560
the energy involved becomes

211
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:41,089
strong enough to discharge so here is

212
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:47,839
the circuit then it includes so it was

213
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,370
an idea  just to do something

214
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,790
different a piece of logic programmable

215
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,370
program that manages this is

216
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,140
another thing that I tell you in a moment

217
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,350
eu  n modulino sp12 those that do

218
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,779
similar arduino based on sp 82 66 you

219
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,320
will probably know that they expose

220
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,580
a wifi interface

221
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:16,730
that practically allows you to control

222
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,569
the tesla from a web page built in

223
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:22,910
let's say inside the device and

224
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,410
control what for the moment are

225
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,129
the few functionalities of  implement

226
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:32,919
inside this machine the functionalities

227
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:37,519
implemented in practice what

228
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:46,309
are they we will see if this I told you for

229
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:51,169
example I can say run

230
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,949
as in this case 6 cycles and then

231
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:57,739
stopped this taq taq taq sends me in

232
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,419
execution 6 cycles then stops you see that it

233
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:03,350
does not  there are more these spikes I decide

234
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,149
how many to do in practice in this way

235
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:07,160
decided how intense I want the

236
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,259
discharge to be or I can tell him send me a

237
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:15,410
series of consecutive impulses and then

238
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,589
interspersed impulses which in practice

239
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:20,569
mean that instead of lighting

240
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:23,569
up and down I turn on a  time above

241
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:28,189
then once below I jump once

242
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:31,699
lgbt above in practice I pump a

243
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:33,410
little bit less current is like

244
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,059
going on my pendulum instead of

245
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:36,589
hitting it all the times

246
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,699
once hit it once I let it go

247
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:43,279
again I hit it the result

248
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:50,420
what is it that decreases the impetuosity

249
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,709
let's say of the system because if I

250
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:54,920
continued every  time to

251
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,430
throw in throw energy in the current at a

252
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,990
certain point it would become exaggeratedly

253
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,779
high then it was the

254
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:07,459
characteristics of the spark change a bit let

255
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:09,410
's say the lightning bolt seat do this

256
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,850
because I can say that I know I give it 25

257
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,980
strokes in a row and I get a lightning bolt of

258
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,089
a certain type

259
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:20,449
or I can say I give it 15 strokes plus

260
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:24,139
others interspersed the result is that

261
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:26,059
maybe in the first

262
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:28,450
case in the first case I

263
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,800
load a lot of energy and get

264
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,170
a lightning bolt of a certain type

265
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,750
in the second case neither load or not the

266
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,820
lightning starts the same and continuous  for

267
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,440
longer because I can afford to

268
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,790
go on for longer in this

269
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,130
way pumping energy when the lightning

270
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,290
has already started the idea is

271
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,210
hoping  za was to be able to do

272
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,030
what they call swords instead of

273
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,370
branched lightning strikes because

274
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,660
they are done with such a technique at the

275
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,890
moment the functionality does not work anyway

276
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,030
and attempted implemented

277
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,780
here is this figure that I

278
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,390
was showing now is an

279
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,520
example in which there  there were 30 impulses

280
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,730
followed by impulses with

281
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,339
one yes 1 no 1 yes and one no in which there

282
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,709
was also a discharge to give an idea

283
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,329
of here here was this growth phase

284
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:22,350


285
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,170
after it would have remained relatively

286
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,760
constant in reality it is  once the discharge has taken place

287
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,620
the discharge takes on a lot of energy

288
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,390
but here once the discharge has already occurred

289
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,000
it continued to sustain a certain

290
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,180
amount of current to give an idea

291
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:43,670
instead a case of 25 pulses and that's it

292
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,330
[Music]

293
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,610
making repeated attempts and measures

294
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,350
the case of  above there was no discharge

295
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,330
to say in the case below there was

296
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,820
discharge this thinking about the circuit

297
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,620
that I told you we showed at the

298
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,330
beginning that when the sc  arica

299
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,310
absorbs my energy

300
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,990
in fact we see my twenty-five

301
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,780
impulses and they are all here at the beginning

302
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,550
but it discharges when I stop

303
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,310
pulsing and oh well it slowly fades away

304
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,340
turns off nothing has happened

305
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,990
the energy is eaten away if the

306
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,960
discharge is there  it is the discharge yes it does it to me how

307
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,610
it closes much more much

308
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,910
faster

309
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,350
anyway I first skipped a couple of

310
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:32,260
slides then yes where I meant we

311
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,630
put two apart the

312
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,080
power electronics part the relative drivers two

313
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,330
control elements the

314
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,730
programmable logic  and the sp arduino then the

315
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,240
programmable logic manages the single

316
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,480
discharge and these times that I told you a

317
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,880
little while ago manages the resonance by running

318
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,770
after the current commutations

319
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,350
those that are measured by the

320
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,350
system but it does as many as I say

321
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,010
continuous and then it does  how many do I say,

322
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,240
skipping half cycles in practice,

323
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,320
inside the logic there are three counters

324
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,960
that I can program to

325
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,200
tell it how many at the beginning  or how many then with

326
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,270
how many jumped in

327
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,830
from the sp arduino part in short there is the

328
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,810
web server that was practically

329
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,580
free with the moment there is a very minimal page

330
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,840


331
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,070
the configuration of the counters because

332
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,510
I want to write them even those

333
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,740
remotely I mean  what are the

334
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,980
numbers to put and these are

335
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,440
transferred with a sp interface in the

336
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,930
programmable logic and then however the

337
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,520
management of the repetitions because we

338
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,720
still lacked one thing we had

339
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,980
reached only one download

340
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,190
we want to do what I know we want to

341
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,320
have it downloaded for 10 seconds let's say  and

342
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,030
then stop we want it to discharge

343
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,099
for 20 seconds by making a discharge

344
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,260
according to two discharges per second and at the

345
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,470
moment I did it up to a maximum of

346
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,449
100 discharges per second

347
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:19,109
because the power part is powered

348
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,030
directly by a

349
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,910
50 hertz network rectifier  50 to bridge

350
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,010
rectifier and filter capacitors

351
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,500
with bridge rectifier the

352
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,120
with wire capacitors charged one hundred times

353
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,880
s  according to each half cycle of the

354
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,190
alternating so up to 100 pours I am sure that

355
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,540
between one discharge and the other that one has

356
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,600
recovered and is charged by the

357
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,490
nominal voltage of the

358
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,790
power stage which is that 300 300 is 15 times

359
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,790
that are  out of the

360
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,409
direct tension straightened

361
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,950
it goes well here I had visualized an

362
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,770
extract of logic that then

363
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,140


364
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,690
I drew it so in reality it was

365
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,280
also an exercise for me to learn

366
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,440
the reload a little bit inside the

367
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,970
programmable logic I had written it  in very

368
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,980
long the logic code is the

369
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,300
reader of spi registers and counters

370
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,560
to manage these things that I called

371
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:24,500
presses in team and then a poker

372
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,810
of interlock logic that made with a flip flop

373
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,960
set and reset a bit of doors and

374
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,560
so on  that are used to give safety

375
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,460
to the system because I told you earlier that it

376
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,830
switches when

377
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,600
the current is reversed that is an excellent

378
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,010
time to switch because it is a

379
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,480
moment in which the current is almost close

380
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,620
aa 0 however there are other moments in

381
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,350
which I go to switch when for

382
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,890
example

383
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,670
an over current is detected

384
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,230
or when I want

385
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,390
to stop with my meters or if I

386
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,490
wanted from the outside with the sp during

387
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,920
the half  of a cycle to go and stop I

388
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,340
always want to be sure to

389
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,290
discontinue a transition not

390
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,090
prematurely in short, so there

391
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,220
is this bit of logic that serves

392
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,440
to save igbt because if I accent the

393
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,620
ampere I go to open it unfortunately I

394
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,260
risk  break it is supremely when

395
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,100
when closed

396
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,410
it holds them quite well so I

397
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,510
put some photos of how the

398
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,870
piece of electronics developed as

399
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:44,720
we are silver looks like this is this lsp

400
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,410
power supply part igbt power the

401
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,990
current transformer that here was in

402
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,650
phase  test had a primary of several

403
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,680
turns the here is this is the

404
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,130
programmable logic removed the sp the

405
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,140
small programmable logic and this

406
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,030
in the block  tto of the comparators the

407
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,120
trimmer for the calibration of the over

408
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,389
current the system to detect

409
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:15,919
the inversions from looking at it from

410
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,849
the opposite side here are the two igbt

411
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:22,599
that giant black object is a

412
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:25,700
capacitor and

413
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,169
high-capacity polypropylene cody high because it is necessary to

414
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:32,239
put it very close  the

415
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:33,889
power components something that can provide

416
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:39,499
the energy needed to

417
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:42,469
perform the single cycle then

418
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:45,859
outside this is powered by a part

419
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:49,190
of the power supply board which is

420
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,619
the software in the part below you see the

421
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,320
mosfet driver here it is  it is mounted

422
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,469
inside the tesla it is near there is the

423
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:59,299
power supply part rectifier

424
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,070
electrolytic capacitor it is certain

425
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,679
that I did not do it on purpose it

426
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,929
obtained from an existing

427
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,070
electronics here what you see on the right the

428
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,950
capacitor bank the part below

429
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,470
long caged a little bit to

430
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:22,030
protect it but on the front side he

431
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,350
left us a plastic to allow the

432
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,840
wifi to pass in short, it was stat  it is a bit of

433
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,090
a challenge to put the wifi

434
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,030
close to these electromagnetic fields

435
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,919
but it must be said that the text of

436
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,140
the car works of its self resonance

437
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,840
in this case and 650 kg hearts compared

438
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,750
to 2.4 gigahertz in short there is more than three

439
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,700
orders of magnitude more than a thousand times

440
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,950
the frequency in fact they do not

441
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,090
disturb this at the moment it is the

442
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,809
face seen on copied from the phone

443
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:59,470
in short very very banal

444
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,590
cycle counters as above mei skip

445
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,640
repetition frequency duration at the moment is

446
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,400
only used to control  the machine 11 clear

447
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,870
that you can make pages where you

448
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,490
do predefined experiments

449
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,320
of the sequences in which you first expand

450
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,870
slowly then you go strong

451
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,909
I would also have liked to have it imported

452
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:20,530
maybe loads all a little

453
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,750
weaker but

454
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,730
but higher frequency to make it sound

455
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,870
to do  some digital melodies like

456
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,340
those of the video games of the past but

457
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,290
this thing I have finished a few

458
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,620
days in short so there will be little to do

459
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,190
here  some downloads that

460
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,710
however

461
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,330
I hope to be able to show you

462
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,830
tonight at what

463
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,630
as I said not only not only giants but

464
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:54,899
in short it is something something does here

465
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:59,610
also put some of Europe let's see if it

466
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:05,600
starts here for example a second

467
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,330
10 per second start from two  points okay

468
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,449


469
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:23,239
or things

470
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,080
more and more more and more energetic here in the

471
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,300
queue the presentation I had left

472
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,980
some site of the classic ones but

473
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,290
this thing then I plan to publish

474
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,470


475
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,720
also as a project so out of curiosity

476
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,289
as an electronic project of the circuit

477
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,450
here is how I said tonight there is

478
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,770
some demos are planned not only of

479
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:51,220
this but also of some other

480
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,049
equipment that we have brought in

481
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:54,940
particular etcetera between us

482
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,320
mauro de rai that a passionate

483
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,400
manufacturer of especially

484
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,070
valve systems for which there will be more more than

485
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,240
something

486
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,170
to see this  evening enough I would have

487
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,490
finished if you have any questions

488
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,900
the fact of putting electronics

489
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,370
of that type next to cpl

490
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,850
of processors  i etc. with what is

491
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,370
generated from the electromagnetic point of view

492
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,440
even below where

493
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,490
the bulk of the phenomenon occurs despite there

494
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,930
are these orders of magnitude on the

495
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,580
wifi but on the others on the other

496
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,170
devices there are no problems of

497
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,050
electromagnetic reading

498
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:54,850
potentially enough worked to do

499
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,309
the layout of the printout and it went

500
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:58,170
well for me

501
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:03,040
but I was worried but for example

502
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:09,280
now I have not stopped but for

503
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,250
example by looking at the below here

504
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:17,650
you can see that the driver is mounted in

505
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,679
an area a little protected from power and

506
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:24,429
uses some  bifilar coupled lines

507
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:28,090
to go to the gate source gate of the

508
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,870
igbt with the series resistors

509
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,040
placed at the very end

510
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,290
below there is the whole area where there is the

511
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,910
power capacitors and there is an area

512
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,800
where on the other side there are some

513
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,200
tracks  very large that carry the signals

514
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,990
of alt to current that are reported on

515
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,150
this side the output is down this

516
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,130
side to the power supply of the power section

517
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,330
and this side  this this driver is

518
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,530
doubly isolated it keeps

519
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:59,300
isolates both the component other than the

520
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,170
low component so it keeps me even

521
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,550
if I do not keep the masses the isolated masses it

522
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,110
does not create mass rings for me

523
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,680
with the piloting all the

524
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,210
LPG part of extras such as  you see

525
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,210
the ground plane below to shield as

526
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,950
much as possible

527
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,170
on the other side there is a piece

528
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,940
of ground countertop to protect the

529
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,160
digital part of this one is made the

530
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,300
dual layer the printed apple tree I

531
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,780
have had it done for about euro  that is, the

532
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:36,010
designed is fine but there are

533
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,620
many ways to be able to manage

534
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,530
things decently it would not have been an

535
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,980
easy home realization but

536
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,480
doing it so without asking for any

537
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,740
finish because as you can see there is no

538
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,310
solder mask there is no screen printing etc.

539
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,860
I got away with it  with less than 50 euros

540
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,980
on a 100 percent events they did

541
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,420
even in a few days

542
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,400
here the Chinese you can spend less

543
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,110
every day but then you get together

544
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,330
with a  a lot of time is actually

545
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,330
yes I had when you start you want to

546
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,320
close around then there are also

547
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,549
some pieces made in 3d printing for example

548
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:24,140
where is the support of this

549
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,850
transformer that you obtained from a

550
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,470
commercial toroid that we already have at

551
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,820
home ended up is  done in 3d printing some

552
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,940


553
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,480
mounting brackets and and boards here are are

554
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,850
3d printed those too it was a bit

555
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:46,810
a bit a good totò I do it yourself so three

556
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,020
questions

557
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,690
