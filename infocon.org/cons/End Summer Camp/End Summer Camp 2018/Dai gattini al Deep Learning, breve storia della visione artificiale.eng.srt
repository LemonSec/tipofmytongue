1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
hello everyone thank you for coming

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,060
sorry for the delay but there was an emergency

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,269
and planning kittens basically

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:10,889
so a very very serious thing

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,500
excuse me if in the meantime I go

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,910
back and forth with my eyes but the sight is

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,730
killing me this this beautiful

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,939
thing reflector  let's talk today indeed

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,080
let's do it a little step

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,779
back

11
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:27,779
hi my name is michael i do the given

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,000
scientist i mainly deal with

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,469
machine learning i work in a company in the

14
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,719
province of padua

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,399
we do some of these cute little things

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,170
we don't have many cats but we are

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,219
gearing up in short then since  where

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,489
we start with this discourse

19
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,629
we have machines that do practically

20
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,840
anything we are thinking of

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,370
using machines that drive

22
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,160
themselves we organize drones in a lot of

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,969
ways

24
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,030
we use a lot of technology a lot

25
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,469
of this technology but the lacking from

26
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,899
a fundamental point of view is not

27
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,280
able  to see how we see

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,430
and there is a fundamental problem with that

29
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,290
we see in such an

30
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,509
intuitive way that we think it is a simple task

31
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,189


32
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:19,799
it is not a foreshortening task at

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,460
all at all at all

34
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,490
that's why we find it a bit difficult to give

35
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,560
this ability to the machines precisely

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,119
because we ourselves have a little difficulty

37
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,729
in understanding what it is to see exactly

38
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,479
what are the focal points to solve

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,860
what are the problems to solve in the

40
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,979
vision what is this this is called

41
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:49,470
unstable figure I don't know if ok this

42
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,659
thing doesn't work well on this the

43
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,090
reflector is an image with

44
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,590
an unstable configuration

45
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,630
you have seen all those images  who

46
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,360
have more than one interpretation able

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,729
to see it as something that comes

48
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,470
out or something that goes in at the

49
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,149
same time

50
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,220
this type of illusions and are

51
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,709
fundamental to make us understand what are

52
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,130
the mechanisms underlying the vision

53
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,489
basically the fact that it is not

54
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,560
taken for granted that we  we can

55
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,920
interpret a three-dimensional world

56
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,690
we have an apparatus that gives us an

57
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,390
i  Two-dimensional image

58
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,769
from which we insert the

59
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:30,870
three-dimensional shape into the objects but on

60
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,190
our retina that

61
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,180
two-dimensional image to insert this shape

62
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,040
we use eu ristic, that is,

63
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,010
simplified rules of computation methods that are

64
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,560
not exactly exact

65
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,290
but very very fast and light that

66
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,850
can go there  the 3d image respects

67
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,970
what we are looking at the problem

68
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,440
is that being heuristics are not always

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,420
perfect the optical illusions

70
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,549
are basically the blitzes

71
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:04,019
within the system all we see them

72
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,540
if this is able to see it but maybe

73
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,070
you are color books simply the other

74
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,140
was  due to the three-dimensional inference

75
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,370
of two-dimensional images

76
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,940
this is the context effect we have

77
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,630
the same color even if

78
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,690
you know it you can still see the different color

79
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,489
this is essential to be able to

80
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,260
navigate in a space to obtain

81
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,120
additional information on the quality

82
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,580
of objects in the environment

83
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,470
of things not  we had this ability that

84
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,320
there s here  it seems a vision defect

85
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,940
we did not have this ability we will not

86
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,740
be able to solve a lot of

87
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:47,760
tasks our complex vision

88
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,090
even just the apparatus how to say

89
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,890
the camera sensor

90
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,710
already only those very very complex

91
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,170
we think we think that the

92
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,570
deer image on the retina a  place if you see is

93
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,550
that thing in the shape of hicks with the now

94
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,330
the optic nerve

95
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,100
at the point where it crosses it is

96
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,960
called cassation a part

97
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,750
of the information the right eye is

98
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,700
conveyed with a part of the information

99
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,579
the left eye and goes to  left and one

100
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,589
part of the left information does the

101
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:30,700
same to the other part because it's okay you

102
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,539
can be the

103
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,880
exact answer because having eyes that

104
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,680
are basically spheres

105
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,000
we need to integrate the

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,770
information coming from this part

107
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,270
of the visual field with  the information that

108
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,680
comes from that part of the visual field

109
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,870
that is collected and from the two eyes

110
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,020
simultaneously at that point

111
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,080
once the info  rmation is sent to

112
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,480
the optic nerve and is actually decorated

113
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,480
then a journey begins a part

114
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,419
of the information b a neural network

115
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:03,760
that passes over the brain another that

116
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,380
passes under the brain and the 32

117
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,830
literally is an extremely

118
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,020
intricate system that joins everything  the rest

119
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,210
of the systems that are internal to the

120
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,000
brain to allow us to see but

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,580
this thing is very complicated

122
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,890
when we make the analogy

123
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,370
with the camera for vision

124
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,880
the camera is roughly the retina

125
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,950
not much because there is much more

126
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,750
that is c  'is already processing the first layers

127
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,130
of the

128
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,140
retina realize that we should have for

129
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,340
example

130
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,680
a hole in our visual field for each

131
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,050
eye the point where the optic nerve

132
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,169
fits into the socket of the

133
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:49,540
eye there is there there is a  empty there

134
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,639
are receptors but we do not see this

135
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,380
thing of or

136
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,699
integrated our eye among other things is

137
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:57,370
taken for example by creationists as an

138
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,380
example of perfection that cannot  ò not

139
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,460
result if not from a creator but in

140
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,100
reality it is absolutely bagato our

141
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,400
receptors look back that is

142
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,530
blood vessels and innervation are

143
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,750
in front of the receptors with respect to the

144
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,400
image and it is a designer type thing

145
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,780
I do not think he would have done it

146
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,389
this way  and we to be able to see

147
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:23,979
how we see we have to integrate that

148
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,780
information example this work is

149
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,070
done in the early stages immediately

150
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,930
but then we have a lot of other things

151
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,020
we have to do to make sense of

152
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,340
things

153
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,960
an image can be easily

154
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,400
represented in rgb with three

155
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,900
two-dimensional matrices with a bit of values is not

156
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,120
a difficult thing but from there to understand

157
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,789
what is in the image the past so

158
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:52,450
much that really passes here we have

159
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,070
a small representation of

160
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,760
what is the structure of the neocortex and

161
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,830
of the pause court but let's say  yes of

162
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,250
a cortex

163
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,610
there is a primary visual recall air is

164
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,410
the only area affected by the vision

165
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,660
no it does only that n  or however it is called the

166
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,250
primary visual area you see that there

167
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,320
are overlapping layers

168
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,310
this is a hint handwriting

169
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,300
basically they took a

170
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,490
piece of the brain cut it

171
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,880
and colored it to make it evident

172
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,970
if you see there is a hierarchy

173
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,349
remember it will come  will come back after

174
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:36,580
this the pixel does not mean by

175
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,720
itself we said it

176
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,030
I hope it is a clear concept I

177
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,470
do not know how to make it understood the fact that it

178
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,700
gives an image pass a

179
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,990
representation of the world

180
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,790
passes a few identifications of

181
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,590
objects and one  of the many tasks we

182
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,150
do every day when we see

183
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,180
without even noticing

184
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,660
what it is this is a beautiful kitten and it is

185
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,880
easy to recognize it is not immediate a

186
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,010
two-year-old child recognizes it as a

187
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:08,170
kitten in the early stages of history

188
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,180
and artificial vision was attempted to

189
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,770
approach  interesting to solve the

190
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,120
problem of identifying

191
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,660
objects that is modeling

192
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,550
what is a cat then do us  or more or less an

193
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,560
index of the distance of the image that I am

194
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,390
seeing with respect to the model I get

195
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,600
an idea the cat is also easy that is that they

196
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,830
pin the longtail field the fia

197
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,230
quite soft etc. etc.

198
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:37,620
so it is easy to identify and now

199
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,880
what we do our model  where

200
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,380
exactly it had to we can have

201
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,970
different points of view

202
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,250
the cat can have different positions

203
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,290
remember that the cat is not a

204
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,060
solid and less liquid and what happens with

205
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,350
this difficult little one is difficult if you

206
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,470
use a model so at

207
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,640
a certain point in our history

208
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,010
this story is very long that is if

209
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,950
we start from the beginning of the history of the

210
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,640
study of vision two centuries ago

211
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,100
roughly when we began to

212
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,800
understand something a century ago the kittens

213
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,840
intervened even then to give us a

214
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,950
hand

215
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,380
not so voluntarily electrodes in the

216
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,900
skull and something like that

217
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,240
a nobel was won for this the

218
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,370
nobel on the identification of

219
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,260
perceptual fields was fundamentally

220
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,450
found that some neurons respond

221
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,240
specifically to shapes with

222
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,760
specific and specific inclinations and some others

223
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,920
with different inclinations

224
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,930
this thing is very important because it

225
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,410
has given us insight and norms on how

226
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,880
vision works how

227
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,380
neural computation works in our brain

228
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,500
we have been taught

229
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,450
something  a teacher who

230
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,310
explained to us how to do these tasks how to

231
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,920
infer three-dimensional geometry

232
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,990
how to distinguish objects how to

233
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,610
exploit the context to get more

234
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,760
information comes to us

235
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,540
absolutely naturally

236
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,850
but then wanting to solve the problem

237
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,470
of artificial vision

238
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,060
wanting to give machines the ability

239
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,610
to interpret  the world is a good way

240
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,980
to use a model to explain

241
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,990
specifically what it has to see what it

242
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,160
has to do

243
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,950
maybe not so much at some point

244
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,550
an interesting thing

245
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,980
happens that machine learning then

246
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,960
that set of statistical techniques

247
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,790
that are used to solve problems

248
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,290
problems without having to explain the

249
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,720
machines what the solution is but

250
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,310
making sure that the machine derives from the data

251
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,080
the solution autonomously ok

252
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,230
they encountered the internet and at a certain

253
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,690
point even the computational power

254
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,770
reached a sufficient level to

255
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,650
allow you to take advantage of certain  algorithms

256
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,850
certain algorithms that were carried

257
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,350
out for many years to solve

258
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,990
this problem but that just couldn't

259
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,430
do it in reality we are talking about here

260
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,130
more or less 2009

261
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,170
in 2009 it was founded for example by

262
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,140
some scientists many

263
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,130
psychologists imagine that it is a database

264
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,950
of images with balls

265
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,380
this is a cat this is a dog

266
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,420
this is a flower more or less 15 thousand

267
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,570
classes took a lot of effort a

268
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,430
lot of effort a lot of human work

269
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,680
but basically they took advantage of

270
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,020
the internet so kittens

271
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,580
intervened once again to  give us a

272
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,400
hand because without them without the

273
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,100
preponderant presence of the skies

274
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,870
inside the internet  we would not have

275
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,100
had some of our classes and here

276
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,440
comes a technique to deep neural

277
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,510
networks basically what we

278
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,110
call deep learning what is this

279
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,480
thing indeed for we start from this

280
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,540
nice old man a professor an

281
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,750
english professor what is called

282
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,570
the cause of neural networks  for

283
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,610
years to solve the problem of

284
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,800
artificial vision for years it went

285
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,810
on no this best method the

286
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,810
best method let's use it true lost

287
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,120
all competitions

288
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,920
until the internet arrived

289
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,650
the computational power from lillo and

290
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,720
defined the standard to solve the

291
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,420
problem then  the combo lution to the neo

292
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,880
to the networks a specific type of

293
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,950
neural network before people use models

294
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,620
used decision 3 used other

295
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,650
machine learning techniques now that's the

296
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,870
standard musi something different or

297
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,209
better then he knows something different because he

298
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,339
just released another model

299
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,930
of neural network that perhaps will supplant

300
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,450
the previous one

301
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,760
that  what is a neural network, however, now

302
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,990
I am doing the most pulpy part of the

303
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,180
presentation do not be afraid for the

304
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,740
letters in greek it is one thing it is a

305
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,100
summation basically what a

306
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,680
neuron does a number it takes the inputs

307
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,430
that are weighted in short it has its own

308
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,010
internal function  with a threshold and says it is

309
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:22,820
quite

310
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,320
ok it is quite no when he says ok he shoots

311
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,350
too the neurons do this they are very

312
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,990
simple units in a very

313
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,200
very complex network

314
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,080
basically learning happens because those weights

315
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,780
are modified in a sensible way

316
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,820
to achieve the purpose you are

317
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,680
looking for  to reach iteration

318
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,180
interaction after interaction to

319
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,860
the vip neuro networks federation we put

320
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,120
a lot of these things together in

321
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,850
the next layer and then we do

322
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,400
instead of one thing my little one we limit

323
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,070
many one after the other the result

324
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,750
of the previous computation and it becomes the

325
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,400
input of the next computation

326
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,449
and  so on

327
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,510
from here to give computers the ability to see

328
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,090


329
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,680
let's talk about it then take a nice

330
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,230
image image made per pixel

331
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,320
then let's say that the input value of

332
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,750
each single input neuron is the

333
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,420
value of the pixel

334
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,040
this value is multiplied by the

335
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,160
weight of that connection with the

336
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,650
next neuron

337
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,630
at this point there is the  'integration

338
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,190
means that some of these neurons

339
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,760
some of these married pixels

340
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,690
will pass through the

341
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,140
mathematical filters ok of the kernels of the

342
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,850
mathematical filters and with a

343
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,730
topological localization so the neighboring ones

344
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,680
will interact with neurons that are close

345
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,050
and so on and so on

346
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,820
and at this point they will slowly begin

347
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,360
to  extract future features

348
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,560
gradually more and more complex

349
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,290
we start from what he had said in the

350
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,750
kitten lines lines with certain

351
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,570
inclinations line assembled in

352
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,600
with the other curves backgrounds fields more or

353
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,590
less dark color differences

354
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,130
gradually as there is computation

355
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,690
we arrive  to increasingly complex features

356
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,850
a structure that resembles an eye one

357
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,140
structure that resembles the nose is a

358
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,620
structure that resembles the cat's tail

359
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,720
more and more complex until the end

360
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,340
what basically does a

361
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,350
neural network that has to do image recognition

362
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,470
extracts these features and stay

363
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,680
these features and then uses

364
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,180
the last part of the network to  make a

365
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,960
classification says the object that I

366
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,140
know as a cat what characteristics

367
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,410
these ok has them

368
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,690
all yes no what is the cool of neural networks

369
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,260
that are very robust a

370
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,470
model just changes the object you are

371
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,450
seeing in the most suitable to represent it

372
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,880
the network  neural instead ekstrand by itself

373
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,980
the characteristics and very robust

374
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,350
noise you have given that it is so and so to

375
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,930
a paw above anything

376
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,440
you can identify it because you put

377
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,930
within the data set the variance

378
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,020
to which you want to be able to respond and

379
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,790
therefore basically building a

380
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,070
dataset you are already giving the

381
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,630
neural network the ability to respond to

382
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:35,680
those tasks ok maybe

383
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,200
ok you remember what  we said

384
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,730
before

385
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,750
you see this hierarchical structure do not

386
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,130
jump kittens this our my

387
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,400
cortex we have

388
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,350
inside our head a

389
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,590
neural network that already does this task

390
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,980
what you see there on the left

391
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,660
basically neuro indifferent

392
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,150
arranged in layers predisposed for

393
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,069
specific computations

394
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,780
we still do  struggles to determine

395
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,770
which exactly with

396
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,520
organized votes to succeed the arcella

397
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,290
ability to interpret the world

398
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,880
around us starting from a

399
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,230
two-dimensional image projected on the retina

400
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,790
this is a way in which we see for

401
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,310
what we know now from here we

402
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,030
have managed to  extract the concept and

403
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,310
apply it to machine learning to

404
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,930
transform it into a technology that are

405
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,620
neural networks facebook when it tells you you

406
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,750
want to pay foo in the photo he has

407
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,610
just uploaded what he is doing knows

408
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,110
that it is foo because he uses your

409
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,630
images to pull models of

410
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,280
neural networks  for facial recognition

411
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,390
when we want

412
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,300
I don't know there are a lot, he said to himself

413
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,590
steini google

414
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,350
we are full of this technology sometimes

415
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,670
we do not even realize

416
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,290
exactly how for us to see is

417
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,390
perfectly normal we are also getting used

418
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,250
to the fact that the machines begin a

419
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,680
little timidly to acquire the

420
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,510
ability to see therefore  it no

421
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,410
longer amazes us to see these things the

422
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,000
fact that now

423
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,680
systems can automatically tell you ok in this

424
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,460
photograph there is a person

425
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,720
taking a plane it is not taken for granted there is a

426
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,180
lot of technology and there is a lot of

427
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,450
understanding

428
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:43,090
times questions I know  that is a lot of stuff

429
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:49,870
girls I know perfectly I can go

430
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,909
on talking now so I pray

431
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,720
one thing is from around 800 that

432
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,090
three-dimensional photos were taken with two

433
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,310
with photographic manga there is some

434
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,560
development also in this aspect

435
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,410
in what sense some development I think that is

436
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,780
having information from a

437
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,300
single photo you get certain information

438
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,760
but if I have two they are three-dimensional

439
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,950
images it is easier to est  obtaining

440
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,570
information is a little easier

441
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,060
we can evaluate the distances within

442
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,700
a certain range but not beyond

443
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,970
and we are not too close in reality

444
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,500
so within a certain range we are very

445
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,760
good we have stereoscopic vision

446
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,410
basically because in our

447
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,540
period of evolution as a species when

448
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,460
we were  on trees it was very

449
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,440
convenient to have the exact distance of the

450
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,150
branch we wanted to cling to during

451
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,550
another it was a matter of life or death

452
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,890
and for this reason we have eyes on the

453
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,190
front of the face other evils year on the sides

454
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,410
to have a wider field of view to

455
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,420
identify  predators we needed to

456
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,080
have stereoscopic vision when

457
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,940
the object we want to estimate is too

458
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,410
distant we can no longer use this

459
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,480
system we use others many

460
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,090
others it is not a single system for example it is

461
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,500
the relative movement of objects more

462
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,780
or less distant systems  of occlusion

463
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,360
of one object with respect to the other if

464
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,770
we are moving more distant objects

465
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,750
they move less than

466
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,050
us

467
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,560
and this is an index of what comes first

468
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,390
compared to what and therefore we make a

469
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,790
more distant estimate of things we do it

470
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,560
in a totally unconscious way

471
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,600
unaware yes like

472
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,080
most things

473
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,880
someone else

474
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,780
there is a lot  of stuff from neural networks

475
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:42,040
to the history of psychology and ecology

476
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,270
as needed a beautiful field

477
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,470
remember that a lot of this

478
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,020
technology comes from people who have

479
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,910
studied those materials unfortunately in

480
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,160
Italy we have preconceptions

481
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,460
about technique and psychology put together but

482
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,300
obviously they work

483
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:12,529
now he explained to us  substantially that

484
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:15,179
the understanding of a cat passes, however,

485
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,700
initial 7th step among the more or

486
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,110
less complex mechanisms you do not enter into this matter

487
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,269
because I am not able to understand

488
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:24,950
that it is a cat if the dataset we say is

489
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,320
poisoned by dirty data

490
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,669
substantially

491
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:32,860
the concept of the cat  of the machine

492
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,320
will become a monster sixth time that can

493
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,850
happen a human accustomed to

494
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,039
see knows that what a cat is

495
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,809
wrong a window for him will be a

496
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:47,080
cat ruin condemnation of

497
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,020
dirty dated a neural network is

498
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,720
something irreversible or something that

499
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,850
once you have ruined the mind of the

500
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,590
machine then you never go back I

501
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,039
don't know if  then I explained myself

502
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,020
as usual ctc tout if the

503
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,179
bagato dataset turned out to be that you

504
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:07,990
paid for a capacity and it may happen that

505
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,390
you do a training again by adjusting the

506
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,669
dataset basically ok so

507
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:15,159
let's say you have not lost knowledge because

508
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:16,840
maybe something that lasts over the years the

509
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,700
knowledge that learns

510
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,740
is learning

511
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,720
no actually basically what

512
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,270
is done is an interactive process

513
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,610
that is computationally extremely

514
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,419
heavy because you have to what happens

515
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:34,150
to train a neural network and

516
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,240
to present it to him he starts

517
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,110
with algorithms to make an algorithm more

518
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,370
used in this case is the back

519
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,740
propagation basically makes

520
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,419
the signal propagation

521
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:48,159
the right one  or a little bit and weights to see

522
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,780
if the result he has obtained with respect

523
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,929
to the input he has been given coincides

524
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:56,100
and you do it once twice three times

525
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,960
billion times every time exposed it

526
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,150
tweaks the weights a little with some

527
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,539
minimization algorithms  'error

528
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:06,309
and then the result arrives however it is

529
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:09,549
very heavy however despite being both

530
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:10,990
very heavy they sell

531
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,610
computational power to do it in reality from

532
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,740
what you should do is re between in

533
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,640
now is very heavy as as as what

534
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,110
in fact data set

535
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,510
indeed the most used neural networks

536
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,309
also  open source to do all these

537
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:27,730
tasks are basically driven by

538
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,010
large companies

539
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,540
together with scientists who start

540
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,860
doing these tasks etc.

541
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,620
and then distributed because you can do

542
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,080
something called transference learning you

543
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,990
take the network that is the description I say

544
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,850
of the structure and of the

545
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,340
mathematical processes and understandings that are true

546
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,770
knowledge knowledge in this case

547
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,280
is in and distributed between the values of  the

548
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,380
weights of the net

549
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,930
you take those weights to the complete net

550
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,970
and what you do

551
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,660
take the last part the top one

552
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,520
and cut it the last part was that

553
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,680
of the classification you can cut

554
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,230
the part of the classification and make it

555
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,720
a new training on yours  dataset of

556
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,930
some kind why do you want a

557
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,460
neural network that can distinguish the

558
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,310
different batmans in the different movies the

559
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,030
different actors who made batman

560
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,540
what you do

561
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,630
you are taking advantage of the learning of the

562
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,580
network that has taken a lot of

563
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,610
precedent to learn how to extract the

564
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,960
characteristics

565
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,820
what is an eye what is a nose what is a

566
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,890
mouth

567
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,540


568
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,910


569
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,240


570
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,520


571
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,020
etc.  features that have already

572
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,460
been taken from the network are already the

573
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,830
inside of this thing is very convenient

574
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,680
because it really means that you and I

575
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,540
on our pc can arouse a

576
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,510
network  neural learning

577
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,710
something quite famous was for

578
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,510
example a company that produced

579
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,890
cucumbers that made a neural network

580
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,140
to distinguish

581
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,880
different types of cucumbers in their machines so as

582
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,340
not to have to separate the harvest to do the

583
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,720
harvest all together then there  it's a

584
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,010
machine that sorted them you can

585
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,990
really do anything with them at that point and

586
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,400
the training is

587
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,550
really simple once the network is

588
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:30,010
pre-trained because otherwise disaster

589
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,600
disaster if you don't need a nice

590
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,750
cluster so many graphics cards a lot of

591
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,110
time

592
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,040
let's talk about graphics cards in between  the other

593
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,740
because the neural network

594
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,530
problem of the graphics problem is similar to

595
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,170
matrix algebra nothing else

596
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,750
we take matrices with numbers

597
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,740
and turn them one way or another

598
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,000
some other

599
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,440
moms my question was about the

600
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,800
inputs when we did these  types

601
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,480
of jobs at the university

602
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,500
we usually always start from the fact that we had to

603
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,480
precisely have a fixed number of nodes

604
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,950
in in  gresso we had to take all the

605
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,570
images and rescaling an equal size

606
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,080


607
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,800
but it seems to me in some cases

608
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,600
impractical for example in this photo

609
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,730
maybe before doing the recognition

610
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,800
of the sawn ato it was even more to the

611
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,780
right I would like to cut it first image

612
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,070
that we do so also facebook and stuff

613
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,620
of the  genre for the faces so there is

614
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,880
still the constraint anyway to have

615
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,800
all the dimensions impute the same

616
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,450
dimension in it depends on the models

617
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,880
but basically you need to re-

618
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,000
scale there are you can apply some

619
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,310
algorithms that become invariant but

620
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,220
you are in fact doing a

621
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,800
internal restyling of the network so

622
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,060
somehow if we have not yet

623
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,990
overcome that problem

624
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,680
these rhythms work in serial in

625
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,180
parallel it is not so easy

626
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,740
this question I remember in the 90s

627
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,870
with silicon graphics and you could

628
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:18,710
schedule the jobs on the n nodes of the network

629
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:22,540
a in that  sense no

630
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,320
absolutely in parallel the facts

631
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,480
the problem can become  are np complete if

632
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,139
for many points of the network

633
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:34,350
if I a matrix with 40 thousand cells and or

634
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,139
a graphics card with 40 thousand inputs

635
00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:41,399
I can do it in time 1 that is, it is totally

636
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:42,809
paralyzed of the two that point of

637
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:46,919
view the various frameworks that are

638
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,200
available today so it is  in software

639
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,850
nx net teano there are many

640
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,860
are fighting at the moment

641
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,590
more than anything else

642
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,960
at least for the two big ones then google and

643
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,529
amazon then tensor flow mx net on the

644
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:07,110
ability to paralyze then on the

645
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,269
internal parallelization of a single

646
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:11,580
machine on graphics cards  or the

647
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,799
parallelization on multiple machines with

648
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,110
graphics card is doing the

649
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,029
battle so much on some other because

650
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,149
for the rest that is the young yellow

651
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:23,610
is not that they are so complex once

652
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:28,309
you have created functions to create

653
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,169
the most common mathematical functions that

654
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:33,929
are used  for each layer a

655
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:36,779
framework of this type made so much

656
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,759
more that and coordinate the paralyzing

657
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:47,840
of the calculations that yes a

658
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,199
full place someone else

659
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:09,119
