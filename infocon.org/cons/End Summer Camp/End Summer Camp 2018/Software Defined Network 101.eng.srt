1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
I am from the bridge I am an

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,000
entrepreneur in the telecommunications sector I

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,810
am founder and

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,250
technical director of red airtelco that

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,080
a provider here in Veneto essentially

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,980
what I do I am a

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,170
python programmer

8
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,609
I cannot take care of over

9
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,010
programming hinges I also take care of

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,099
security travel a  a lot because

11
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,109
we say that between black and the deaf as they

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,310
have been

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,800
going back and forth in the united states for seven years now but on a

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,290
daily basis what I do more

15
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,180
than what I deal with is networking in

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,950
the classic sense so I am an engineer

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,079
obviously directed on linux

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,840
cisco and  router wesker microtek if

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,789
anyone knows him

20
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,039
today let's talk about software design network

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,450
follow try to search on google

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,399
software of the pai network there are

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,070
various various definitions to

24
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,350
this acronym the one I like the

25
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,629
most at least personally and this one

26
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:58,980
that says that the software  e fai network is

27
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,270
a set of technologies that

28
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,829
implement new ones  solutions to

29
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,559
old or persistent problems because,

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,869
let's say, a definition

31
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,750
different from the most appropriate in my opinion than the

32
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,240
others because in reality there is not a single

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,710
soft architecture of the network but

34
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,780
as we will see there are more than a few

35
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,060
and over time the meaning  of software and

36
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,340
brakeman has expanded so much in

37
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,530
such a spectrum of solutions that he

38
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,479
says but I have lost what his initial niche meaning was a bit

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,979


40
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,840
let's see for example what are the

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,299
problems he would like to solve let

42
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,950
's say the concept of software and do network

43
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,799
understood  as a set of technologies

44
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,729
we say there are three categories of

45
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,290
problems that are

46
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,450
historical problems in the data center field where

47
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,790
the explosion of the use

48
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,230
of

49
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,580
virtual networks clearly virtual machines

50
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,650
anything else increased

51
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,630
the number of hosts to an excess and therefore we have a

52
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,490
problem of  mac taylor per wire there are

53
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,200
too many mehcads are affected by the

54
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,900
switch tables and therefore you risk going to

55
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,910
overclock quini undermines flooding on

56
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,040
all the new line and social ports that is

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,270
we have too many wlan

58
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,080
we cannot properly exploit

59
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,490
the numbering in bits of the

60
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,950
gulan network overlap or we

61
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,530
may need to have different customers

62
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,000
different internal environments of the same

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,790
data center to be able to do  overlapping

64
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,740
of the bo class also of

65
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,870
even wlan and the speed of the blog while

66
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,810
I in 2018 the need to create

67
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,750
an instance of a vm rather than a

68
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,970
container and assign them network functions

69
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,440
or in any case

70
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,750
direct characteristics in much less time than  a

71
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,480
ten years ago where good on a vm I have to

72
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,830
hear direct department that

73
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,750
configured everything for me etc. etc.

74
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,130
in the service provider field that

75
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,020
clearly has my automation and management

76
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,540
that is the discourse of still having

77
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,000
a scale of number of devices to manage

78
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,640
very very high and the need to

79
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,800
have something that verifies

80
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,570
the integrity of the p  olicy of the

81
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,820
configuration that I am going to install

82
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,230
the reaction speed

83
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,880
there are situations in which I

84
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,830
have to make a massive configuration change

85
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,560
if I use the techniques of 15

86
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,040
years ago clearly I am not able to

87
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,660
do it in the enterprise environment talk to the

88
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,030
hybrid cloud need to keep  of the

89
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,739
servers in the house that and extend them also

90
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:11,840
in the cloud

91
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,459
so google completed it is necessary that

92
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,290
amazon and obviously the management complexity

93
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,940


94
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,160
exist as we have said two

95
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,430
different approaches to the problems that we have seen

96
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,630
the different approaches can be

97
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,810
divided into the two large groups let's say the

98
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,270
first group which is  that of throwing

99
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,320
away everything we know in the

100
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,910
network by implementing a new concept

101
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,370
of network where, however, I have to change the

102
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,260
equipment change the procedures or a

103
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,850
greater risk show so in

104
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,400
this axis we have the risk that is

105
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,050
higher with the new concept but I also have

106
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,060
greater  innovation in the lower set part

107
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,170
or an improvement

108
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,400
of the esis

109
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,620
I try to open my network that already exists and try to

110
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,390
improve its functionality to

111
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,920
solve the problems lower risk

112
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,140
lower innovation what are the

113
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,540
solutions I find today let's say in

114
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,920
the upper quadrant so the one with the greatest

115
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,019
risk is definitely the software and

116
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,000
network nobel flow and after  we will see

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,609
what a controller is where I say

118
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:09,730
a trivial server and a serious one that

119
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,349
could be hhonors which is an

120
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,480
open source linux foundation

121
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,000
project initially it was done with

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,070
athletes but then we say that it has become

123
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,048
part of the community where I have this

124
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:23,199
controller that  device program or in

125
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,880
any case from device policies and

126
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,100
these devices effect in forwarding or

127
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,410
or the possibility of using that

128
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,210
you have one step below the

129
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,949
devices that support idi ai

130
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:34,570
therefore or routers in the classic sense

131
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,490
of switches in the classic sense which however

132
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,810
can  be programmed by a

133
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,190
controller and pia and therefore that I

134
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,199
expose external interfaces

135
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,479
or by going to reduce the risk

136
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:44,470
in the implementation of

137
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,800
software solutions fi network overlay sdn or

138
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,050
create a network above the existing network

139
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,090
to be able to implement and solve the

140
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,440
problems I have seen before

141
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,720
or automation sdn which is the simple

142
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,330
automation of some pockets and

143
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,889
quantities  else let's go see it

144
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:02,010
in detail we have to start but

145
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,300
let's say from the element to the

146
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,130
base block of the whole network that to the

147
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,560
routers with the switch to try to

148
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,940
understand how the file network software works

149
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,440
were first to understand how

150
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,210
a router works a switch router the switch and

151
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,979
in the classic sense it is a box as you

152
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:16,930
can see from this square clearly with the

153
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,060
inter pace with n interfaces because the

154
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,320
traffic is clearly not generated

155
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,060
enters from one interface exits on another

156
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,010
the job of this box is to

157
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,560
move frames to the packet switch

158
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,050
with rude  and let's say that it is essentially

159
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,690
me the control plane which is the part

160
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,030
inside my router that defines

161
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,280
instead of  is that it holds the configuration

162
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,720
so all the general configuration part

163
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,640
let's say about the caribe device

164
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,020
then the information bass routine all

165
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,920
that is

166
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,930
let's say the physical routes ip and the

167
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,910
fip then let's say the

168
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,190
routing decision of where I turn on the destination interface I

169
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,080
turn a certain  frame a

170
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,090
certain packet that are programmed

171
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,440
within the scope of the same

172
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,320
device in the data plain then moved

173
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,750
to the silicone of the cip6 a hardware kruger

174
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,430
obviously after the lead the machine

175
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,040
carries out its

176
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,330
packet movement not to another door

177
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,250
so this is  a router in the

178
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,990
classical sense but when we take the

179
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,480
step to go to an open type router

180
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,340
florenzi a switch in this case of

181
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,410
the peplum type I what I do and separates

182
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,330
in two different boxes what is

183
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,770
my data plain of my control plane  the

184
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,370
control plane

185
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,160
let's say it is re-imagined as a

186
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,810
controller then a linux server or server

187
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,420
and more often than not inside  a

188
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,130
database with configurations inside

189
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,860
and then with the configuration flops an

190
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,380
open flop type controller that goes to

191
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,350
program n devices that are

192
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,690
on my network always through

193
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,980
this car in fleet interface which will then

194
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,050
program my data plan to do

195
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,900
forwarding  clearly I have the possibility

196
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,790
to really centralize all the

197
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,020
policies and my configurations from the

198
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,730
controller and therefore in reality the

199
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,990
machines that I am going to put

200
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,100
inside my network are no longer

201
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,860
machines completely let's say with in

202
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,270
their configuration all their things

203
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,520
are not whites  box so I

204
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,229
no longer even need to buy the

205
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:05,640
same brand of switch of the same

206
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,410
brand of router in order to centralize

207
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,960
everything my network, my

208
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,610
polis, so it is no longer two vendor

209
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,120
lock in

210
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,800
with this thing and I call it

211
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,690
network  revolution I get there we

212
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,000
revolutionize the network by going one step

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,610
lower we have instead

214
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,150
the implementation of the software  re fi

215
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,840
network through ai where we

216
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,940
still have a station on the plain

217
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,800
air control plane but it is an abstraction

218
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,750
let's say a little softer because I have a

219
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,610
controller that is no longer an

220
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,919
openflow controller but is a

221
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,180
rather generic controller that keeps an

222
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,970
inventory  with the inventory

223
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,410
of your devices inside the routine formation

224
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,820
bass and all of the labels witch and tax

225
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,630
through a series of protocols

226
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,460
this controller is able to

227
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,380
program the devices that are

228
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,300
on the network but are devices that

229
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,860
can be, that is, they can yes to

230
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,390
maintain  the old functionalities and

231
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,530
therefore can always gramma the

232
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,630
putting the configuration inside

233
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,180
the device that is on the territory

234
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,280
that is on the field of the pil both

235
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,960
through centralized programming

236
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,280
so we see for example three

237
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,289
protocols however sm maid but it could

238
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:10,380
also be snmp oreste remnants of ai  .bi

239
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,060
gpg pls which is a pretty cool thing

240
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,710
because I have a controller

241
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,599
that talks about gipi c  on my routers and

242
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,820
therefore it can somehow manipulate the

243
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,590
routing table bgp ls which is a new

244
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,900
kind of extension to the

245
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,360
pgp should have given it the possibility to

246
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,710
pass link states within the

247
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,960
bgp protocol I extend them the bjp to

248
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,729
be able to bring  more information

249
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,440
than what was originally there

250
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,159


251
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,510
or going to directly

252
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,339
program the rebels clearly is

253
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,049
passed to the machine control which then

254
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,150
programs sheen control and let's say

255
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,400
what it was and from whom router and

256
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,959
then I have my data plan  that

257
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,900
this is programmed we can call it

258
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,120
network evolution because I still have a

259
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,830
centralization of the policies yours

260
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,420
as much as what concerns the

261
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,680
management of the network on the

262
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,850
centralized server but in any case I do not have the

263
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,110
need to actually have to

264
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,970
replace let's say the devices that are

265
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,500
on the network I do not have  need to

266
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,540
also change the policy for a purpose i'm not

267
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,010
talking about flops but i'm talking

268
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,170
about networking anyway  classic sense

269
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,450
then we have seen the third type that all

270
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,360
over lei sdn this is let's say the

271
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,860
classic solution that is done inside

272
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,900
the data center or you pass

273
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,850
the network completely I do not care

274
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,650
what is on the existing network of the sales

275
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,420
provider enterprise of the network

276
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,510
I am going to create a series of tunnels

277
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,280
directly between the virtual machines it is

278
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,390
very similar to what I believe we

279
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,890
have seen I have arrived that the

280
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,300
presentation has already started but it is very

281
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,850
similar to what we have seen before the

282
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,560
difference that instead of requiring the

283
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,680
configuration inside

284
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,320
in the virtual machine a controller

285
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,360
that programs virtual switches that

286
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,860
create the pads

287
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,110
between the various vm's then

288
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,060
private network tunnels that are able to

289
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,740
connect virtual machines to each other

290
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,839
this is called network bypass therefore

291
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,640
centralized control that

292
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,380
programs switches that  they create a network over

293
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,060
another network these tunnels that are

294
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,240
created are usually tunnels of b1

295
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,649
say c  he the most classic one that

296
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:04,360
used it at vix lan and the one that

297
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,370
also uses amazon and google cloud

298
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,250
computing to connect let's say the

299
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,200
various yeses within the amazon cloud

300
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,089
or as a fourth option,

301
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:17,470
therefore the one with lower risk that

302
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,810
of automation or not  making

303
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,450
nothing but creates a nice linux server in

304
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,500
which a series of tools are used

305
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,839
so it certainly has a database in which

306
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,050
I consider the inventory of the devices and

307
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,399
all the configuration policies that

308
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,589
I want to do and then I use technologies such as

309
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:34,240
I had some python scripts also beige  and

310
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,270
if one wants to download instead or with

311
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,399
an automation framework that is an

312
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,850
automation framework and via ssh I

313
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,650
connect to my devices so very

314
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,750
similar to that for aima sdn does not

315
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,610
require that the device have

316
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,170
a fog and thick and

317
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,779
specific implementation  therefore it does not require the

318
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,670
device to be able to accept the

319
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,740
squares because the connection between the

320
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,350
linux server and the generic routers takes place between  mild

321
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,300
ssh so yes it is the classic I have not

322
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,500
written so much because it would be

323
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,510
better not in 2018 to use tel

324
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,730
and if those who use it politely stop it

325
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,260
then I am able to program from

326
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,070
my linux

327
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,040
server my generic help or a

328
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,490
replicability of the configurations

329
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,930
then create a

330
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,870
configuration template and because it can be

331
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,300
launched we can install it in the field in a

332
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,430
very quick way and therefore I am

333
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,110
still reactive in changing

334
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,529
policies and or in any case a

335
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:31,270
declarative approach so I am able to

336
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,980
have a series of activities that must

337
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,779
be done on an auto nations

338
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:36,910
framework  as indeed two if I also

339
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,140
relaunch this writing it is not that the

340
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,760
configuration is redone twice

341
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,160
but the system connects and verifies that the

342
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,750
existing configuration in the device

343
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,970
matches what I have defined in

344
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,050
my playbook it is not mine

345
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,550
in mine in my

346
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,740
configuration template obviously I can also

347
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,270
go for a cheese bus

348
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,190
so I can go and get on the device

349
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,500
and rituals  get information then even if

350
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
I do not have a synchronized centralized repository

351
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,610
because it is not the controller

352
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,170
that imposes the configuration for

353
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,220
someone could change the

354
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,200
configuration by hand you device which

355
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,450
in them d.net own blog or

356
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,940
type of plans is not possible then it depends  as it

357
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,959
has been configured most of the time

358
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,510
no now however the possibility to say at

359
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,400
regular intervals got on the

360
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,170
car and sport has a configuration

361
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,810
then I can use comedit or cvs tools

362
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,880
so classic style as if it were

363
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,100
written code I make the comment

364
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,750
inside the miur  e posito of cvs kit

365
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,180
and to proceed lady the differences between the

366
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,529
configuration of the day before the

367
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:30,940
configuration to the day after and

368
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,650
apply a little code review in

369
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,079
this case with figure view on a

370
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:38,140
regular basis and for example in the data field

371
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,670
always in the field sorry service

372
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,060
provider yes  they can go to find the

373
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,160
configurations of all the customers or in

374
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,510
any case of all those of the ice on

375
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,279
networks daily the next day

376
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,959
if there is a difference from the day

377
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:50,350
before

378
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,870
someone on the network team needs to be in

379
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,180
charge of reviewing changes that

380
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,770
have been made because

381
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,209
an extra port has been opened on this firewall

382
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:00,490
because it has been changed that they are a

383
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,440
ip address and a class then in that

384
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,150
case you can go to

385
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,449
these areas more then reviewing let's say

386
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:08,770
the initial scheme we have seen

387
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,630
we started from greater risk

388
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,890
greater innovation then network

389
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,110
evolution openflow then change

390
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,060
making the network completely no

391
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,400
longer think as in paradigms  we are

392
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,050
old but think with the new paradigms

393
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,990
so in terms of white boxes or

394
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,180
white machines that I put on the network

395
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,459
that I can go program up to a

396
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:29,770
network evolution so I still keep

397
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,930
some routers for a little more

398
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,250
advanced that is, they are able to

399
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,510
accept configuration  from a

400
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,270
controller of the most beautiful step

401
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,320
completely then I ignore

402
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,360
c  ompletely the question of the network and

403
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,490
I build another virtual one on top

404
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,290
or network and automation so

405
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,930
I make a

406
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,760
softer approach that is able, however, to

407
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,170
guarantee me the same

408
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,490
functionalities that I would have with the fi

409
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,060
network software but with the automation part

410
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,440
so let's say that initially as

411
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,820
we saw the list of problems that

412
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,130
the brush software could solve it

413
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,060
seemed simply a question of

414
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,000
flexibility it is not just a question of

415
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,040
flexibility that from software fi

416
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,899
network depending on which we say the type

417
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,430
of fan network software that I want to

418
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,750
implement within my line

419
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,120
or  however these characteristics

420
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,370
are still

421
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,649
somehow satisfied so I could

422
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:18,870
take each of these cases here and

423
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,370
apply these rules here

424
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,480
which are the characteristics stops

425
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,820
network there is innovation or a new

426
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,040
solution an old problem I separate the

427
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,779
plans or a control  centralized

428
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,330
maybe separation of  plans not in

429
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,800
all because for example in the automation part you

430
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,570
do not separate control

431
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,660
plane plans and from problems, however, let's say that

432
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,550
most of the features that

433
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,350
I find within a

434
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,089
phinet software solution can be found in

435
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,370
all four approaches, let's say

436
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,899
virtualization

437
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,760
simplification of resource functions and that always

438
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,500
because the goal is to create

439
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,540
less complexity and programmability

440
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,580
the automation of repetitive and repetitive tasks which

441
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,040
is a source of errors both from the

442
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,990
sound and provider point of view and from the enterprise point of

443
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,959
view small question now

444
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,520
I want to try to apply some

445
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,250
concepts that we have seen suffers from the

446
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,959
do one transmission hears about a

447
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,029
lot especially the last few years of

448
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:10,860
vendors who continue to burn in

449
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,970
the software part ago in one

450
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,220
now write it in all how many devices

451
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,440
someone can tell me in which

452
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,570
feature reside what are

453
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,590
software does in one is an sdm overlay ie it

454
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,020
is in rea  lty if we wanted to take a

455
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,970
step back they are nothing more

456
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,150
than vpn at the end they took and

457
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,980
what was in the datasheet of the various firewalls

458
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,810
they removed the written vpn already written

459
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,340
Taiwan software

460
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,780
some might say no it is slightly a

461
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,920
little more because I simply do not have

462
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,450
the vpn  as I had it

463
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,590
before or even a whole series of

464
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,760


465
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,370
self-configuration control monitoring features but it is

466
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,710
nothing more than an improvement of what

467
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,840
was there before or before I had the

468
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,030
vpn that I had to create my certificates

469
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,200
or my keys to  according to which it was

470
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,240
let's say the flavor of the vpn we have

471
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,480
that I was going to create as in the sd one it is

472
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,830
simply already pre-configured I

473
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,150
attach the machine and the duhamel is created on it

474
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,980
let's say between the two super

475
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,680
devices plus devices its matches and anything else does not

476
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,880
solve the  connectivity problems

477
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,230
that is, some companies have

478
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,690
even seen vendors who say never and the

479
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,120
vpn that work badly buy me

480
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,620
with the sd onenet solves it  if the

481
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,780
connectivity below sucks it does not solve the

482
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,250
connectivity before what it does

483
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,320
certainly does a simplification

484
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,570
of the configuration and simplifies the

485
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,430
multi wan most of the time when

486
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,900
you see written when bought a file

487
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,460
not router is described multi wan so much it

488
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,900
does not work anymore this is  it is my

489
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,790
experience that I see around because it

490
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,740
was hurt which they by juan instead you

491
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,210
can do a multi path admonition one

492
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,770
simply because you are the one who

493
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,820
controls the pads

494
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,770
between the two sites router stall on site a

495
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,900
or router on site bo2 with

496
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,400
different activities  I do not care because it creates

497
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,130
two tunnels above in overlay and then I

498
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,570
can do with it at the balance what to do with

499
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,340
it what I want if it reads

500
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,650
I simply do multi wan to

501
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,240
surf the internet they do not work

502
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,980
at least not as people expect it

503
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,750
in full and there is no  the fuseaux is a standard

504
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,460
that is if you see it written by juan by

505
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,690
now on all the data released

506
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,780
all the firewall routers however he read by

507
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,270
juan that impl  ementa barracuda different from the

508
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,500
one it implements I know maybe about the

509
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,150
different what it implements cisco mera

510
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,920
chi to say so it is not actually

511
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,319
a standard

512
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,640
I am finished thank you if there are any

513
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,960
questions I have also managed to stay

514
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,810
within the eighteen minutes that I had

515
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,430
say well

516
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,020
baptized lecce not  I recommend 18

517
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,000
minutes if we do not know everything so

518
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,319
I would say we have room for questions

519
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:34,790
or one more exact minute then

520
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,180
thanks

521
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,520
