00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,160
good morning my name is andrea dami i'm a

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,070
member of the types of italy and today i

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,730
wanted to talk to you a bit about woods and

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,480
what i think has as pluses

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,369
compared to the other databases

6
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:29,659
let's say that i come from far away from comfortable

7
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:36,940
64 and i made myself let's say all the rows

8
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,820
of the knowledge that perhaps is no longer

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,390
used but somehow helps us to

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,520
move forward a little better door has

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,100
declared itself the most advanced open source database

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,220
the world however I

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,380
agree in the definition by basso

14
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,140
let's say you all know ask someone

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,930
who absolutely does not know  things

16
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,640
post es

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,010
you know what a database is you

18
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,140
all know what a database does but also

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,850
a quick review of the economy has

20
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,080
seasoned the review

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,470
the database collects data in

22
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,570
relationships that then materialize into

23
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,450
tables whose basic element is the

24
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,800
brick  it is the type of data big

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,930
step forward compared to when

26
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,230
working with index files where instead

27
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,210
you had a storage space dx

28
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:44,550
byte cloth gesti beatle  s in my opinion it is

29
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,190
characterized by a very high number of data types

30
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,140
compared to those that

31
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,240
are let's say the other players in the

32
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,290
market from oracle I don't talk about it because I

33
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,740
don't know it much but I know sequels it

34
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,570
needs known b2 for having worked on it

35
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,730
a lot of time

36
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,090
I come from  a reality that I worked for

37
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,919
ten years a reality that made

38
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,730
financial software for banks and

39
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,430
therefore compared to this reality that I

40
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:21,070
know I would say that truly a

41
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,350
generation ahead

42
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,650
which are, let's say, summed up in

43
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,880
all the types of data that are

44
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,600
used by boswell as you can see c  'is neither

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,440
an infinite and and then we also have the

46
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,130
so-called composite data types these

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:56,250
after these rather than the ranges because

48
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,230
you must know that for each type of data

49
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,080
placing them if it makes you available even

50
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,750
for some not for all

51
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,060
the ranger i.e. from and for all  instead

52
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,040
it also provides a direction to

53
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,530
declare a data type as a date but

54
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,420
you can also declare it as an array

55
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,250
of dates so in there  they can

56
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:27,870
stay more than one given the advantage of

57
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,910
working as arrays is that then I

58
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,450
can say so interact in a

59
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,459
more meaningful way because I have a whole

60
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,500
series of operators that allow me a

61
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,510
series of advanced things on this

62
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,420
fourth phase going a little fast because the

63
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,500
focus is a little further ahead so don't

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,410
worry if I'm going a little

65
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:58,380
angel flight but to give a little idea I

66
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,030
just wanted you to focus for a moment on the

67
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,630
sweaty type amt which is basically an

68
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,150
ip address for example I needed to

69
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,630
create the instructions  for peace to

70
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,589
block the Chinese from accessing the site

71
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,770
because for a certain class I had no

72
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,050
interest other than getting traffic from

73
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,010
china

74
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,380
I downloaded the ip

75
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,200
address table from da liana I don't remember

76
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,410
which organism put it in this anymore

77
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:43,820
table here and then from here

78
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:56,490
I did I show you from the table the omitted

79
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,849
here you receive say

80
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,080
one you know is the maximum

81
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,750
however basically I put a

82
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,040
progressive and then in the address  ip of

83
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,990
departure and arrival because this is how they

84
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,930
are supplied and the country

85
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,330
to which they have been assigned in this

86
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,590
way here then through a view in

87
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,270
who created a configuration for me to put

88
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:48,120
at peace but which is the king choir ip slash

89
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,900
from 24

90
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,060
obviously if  i wanted to include only

91
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,520
china i

92
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,099
did query team only included

93
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:01,370
country alcina rather than i know i have to

94
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,379
exclude germany is such a

95
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:09,080
thing here so the advantage of

96
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,500
working with a particular data type

97
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:18,139
is that sorry i left gave

98
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:20,919
a little  of things

99
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,840
I would like him to think that you thought that you

100
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,369
prepared this thing here a month before

101
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:44,160
here we are here I can for example this

102
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,000
situation here

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,720
the insertion of the data in the row of the

104
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,510
table and then I tell him that he gives

105
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,070
the address 1110 to the address 11 25  5 and

106
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,060
italy rather than great britain

107
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,230
rather than snapped up if I remember

108
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:09,940
correctly so this is one in the end perhaps he does

109
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,910
not see thematic 4 that is at all

110
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:19,150
the insertion is instead the 70 this

111
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,540
i  nsetting when at the last 260 you

112
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,730
all know that the numbers go

113
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,390
from 0 to 2 55 so the 260 is definitely

114
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:33,719
an error and actually

115
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,070
you don't see much below

116
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,560
there is the message that they jealous I

117
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,290
can't make it bigger than the

118
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,390
boot syntax  it is not validated as a clear data type

119
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:01,500
but interesting thing

120
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,240
also comes when I go to the search because

121
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,140
when I do a search since I

122
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,700
can know what type of data it

123
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,160
is dealing with in addition to doing the classic

124
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,220
search for equal I can also do a

125
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,960
search  to say all those

126
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,600
included in here I have a mac with a

127
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,480
formalism jam a literal chemistry the

128
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,570
cheater format that is I am saying that

129
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,809
I want all the addresses of the network 1

130
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:38,940
32 200 the two if we do insardà also

131
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,720
of the other two

132
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,809
[Music]

133
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,190
we come that

134
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:55,090
not  they served as you can see they are

135
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,080
given to me all of b I hope you come out in

136
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,890
some way see but trust the

137
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:08,010
200 i 2 0 final 200 228 final while

138
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:17,550
the saab net mask is widened

139
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,570
here is that  I add some IPs

140
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,880
because instead of making a bar at 24 I

141
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,550
made a bar at 23

142
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,220
this to make you understand that the fact of

143
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,310
managing a type of data that is

144
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,430
actually consistent with what I

145
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,089
am going to represent then brings

146
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,240
significant benefits

147
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,990
let's go back for a moment  the slides

148
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,130
ok this is what we have just

149
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,650
seen here these are the types of data

150
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:06,370
that post automatically manages also

151
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,120
as a ranger

152
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,500
these are the operators that we

153
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,550
can use so we can say

154
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,400
beyond the classics greater than equal

155
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,940
etc.

156
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,290
however that it contains a range that  contains

157
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,980
an element is all the combination that

158
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,030
you can basically imagine for

159
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,990
example another area where I

160
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,540
used it as part of a school project

161
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,040
24 of which I will tell you later that I

162
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,230
usually use as a basis for all my

163
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,600
examples because it is quite complex  2 24

164
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,400
manages what should be an

165
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,030
electronic ledger

166
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,449
and so let's say the various tables

167
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:04,550
should let's say be pretty

168
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,740
easy to  recognize as a meaning

169
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,100
for which in the school years for example

170
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:20,970
I put due it must be said every

171
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,790
time I put the duration which is a data

172
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,410
range and also the elections which are the

173
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,329
duration of the lessons that if the wave

174
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:36,620
ranges then my school year

175
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,870
starts from a certain  date ends on a

176
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,639
certain date

177
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,029
and then the elections also start on a

178
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,160
certain date which usually coincides with

179
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,589
immediately after the beginning of the

180
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:52,649
school year but they end before the

181
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:55,699
end of the school year because there is then the

182
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:59,759
whole part of the ballot of the votes  in the

183
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,089
final scrutiny exam and

184
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:08,449
the fact of managing them in this way allows me to

185
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:12,829
indicate to boves that I want that

186
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:17,910
within each school there is not an

187
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,720
overlap of the beginning and end of the

188
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,680
lessons,

189
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,189
that is if the school year 2017 2018 I

190
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:30,029
starts on 1st September 18 and ends

191
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:37,910
on 31st August 2019

192
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,819
obviously no one else can start a

193
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:43,379
finish within that interval

194
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:49,610
there for each school as then

195
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,709
a contr is inserted here  ollo where he is

196
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:56,180
told he looks that the duration of the elections

197
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,860
must be within

198
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,280
the duration of the school year as it is

199
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,550
obvious that it is in short, here are these things

200
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,930
which are said in poznan yes in a

201
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:13,680
declarative way as I am showing and

202
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,510
then he manages  this

203
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:21,090
information here, however, today in the

204
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,010
half hour that we have available

205
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:27,000
what I wanted to focus on is the

206
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,970
fact that it is possible to create data

207
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,260
types that is to say those that powers

208
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,200
provides and of which you have seen the

209
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,390
advantage that is what I wanted to

210
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,390
focus on up to  up to now it

211
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,640
was the advantage of using an

212
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,700
incorrect database and therefore

213
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,540
consequently having the possibility to

214
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,240
define one's own data type

215
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,940
consequently you can imagine what

216
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:03,240
advantage the syntax of the

217
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,460
created type in porsche can be very trivial in itself

218
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:13,280
and these are three forms  I think

219
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,210
the first two are dedicated to the type of data

220
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:23,580
itself, the third is for ranges and then let's say

221
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,910
that to define a wave

222
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,360
t  new ype which, however, is a little more

223
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,790
difficult to implement because you have

224
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,910
to write the data management routines

225
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,610
in c

226
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,530
if one knows it is not a big a

227
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,950
big problem but today I

228
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,340


229
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,410
wanted to show him I wanted to show you how instead it is very

230
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,930
simple without going up to  to the

231
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,260
definition of a given from scratch

232
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,020
as simple to manage for example the

233
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,870
classic sex as an enumeration that is

234
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,900
I simply say it looks that

235
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,480
sex as a given type can have as a

236
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,060
value mf male female clearly

237
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,270
sum then if where we go to see

238
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,640
the international standards  in the budget

239
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,090
reference if then if you feel like there

240
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,260
are 13 sexes and truthfully

241
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,010
I understand that it can be a little

242
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:27,540
confusing so it should be

243
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,160
done so data time of perverse sex it

244
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,170
is done like this but let's say that we

245
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,630
simplify and simplify at the

246
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,660
same time we say the possibility of

247
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,630
creating  data type

248
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,700
domains can also be defined,

249
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,920
the domain would be, let's say, limits

250
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,110
that we set  n we have an

251
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:58,710
existing database, for example, it happened to me I think

252
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,420
like everyone having to manage images

253
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,050
I decided to create a data type that would

254
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,310
represent the mind type and

255
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,440
therefore in black and steel I

256
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,000
only made those that interested me the

257
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,120
others did not interest me  you

258
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,580
can always add that is you

259
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,860
can add and also in a

260
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,520
positional way that is before god after

261
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,070
which values to your enumeration

262
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,520
so in this case I have defined a

263
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,970
main type the utility in front of it is

264
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,950
because in pose for itself we have a

265
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,589
arrangement of the skis but what else

266
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:41,570
are you but see how the namespace

267
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,460
sees all those present the concept of

268
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,520
namespace simply a label that

269
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,800
we are going to put in front of the names to

270
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,680
avoid overlapping

271
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,660
so I created shady reasons why

272
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,130
but in the meantime it is something that can be used to

273
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:05,890
any application and then oi numbered

274
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,319
as when

275
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,849
and then oi numbered application

276
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:19,800
gp10 values at night and go if the pa is not clear

277
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,030
vimento and break me at any

278
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:26,449
time and in the domain then I needed

279
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:29,550
to identify only the

280
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,179
images and then I created a domain

281
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:38,580
but intaj of mail which is nothing more than a

282
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,160
given type that relies on a

283
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,410
pre-existing type, however, imposing constraints

284
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,200
in this  case the constraint is that the

285
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,650
value is included among those you

286
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:54,390
see listed here which is that they are all

287
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,040
but in type it is of type email

288
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:03,780
basically I do a little a

289
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,040
little let's say precisely because we need

290
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,270
going forward poster for each table

291
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,980
makes available

292
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,590
so-called columns  of system that he uses to

293
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,280
do things and makes us

294
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,500
available if we explicitly call

295
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,970
you streets we call you

296
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,790
explicitly we do not even realize

297
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,540
that there are what we are interested in

298
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,420
is only this or of which is

299
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,490
essentially an identifier that he

300
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,360
assigns to  whatever is done

301
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,360
in the database and that will help us

302
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,220
then to

303
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,400
fish it without having to remember all

304
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,990
the dear ones  characteristics that possibly

305
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,289
distinguish it so let's go back for a

306
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:56,520
moment and then if we go for example

307
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:05,010
to the system table it can no longer

308
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,070


309
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,520
go out we go to see from the system table

310
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,890
all of the telescope site all the

311
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,750
functions that are called as with pole and

312
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,100
we have this result

313
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,960
if, however  we tell him to show us

314
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,390
the oi column as well as you see he

315
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,760
adds you saw that he had come

316
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,730
in front of another name which is the first the

317
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,950
first column that shows

318
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,320
this added and that we can use to

319
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,960
identify the row even if it

320
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,770
never comes it never comes  view at the level of

321
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,840
destruction of craig table let's say

322
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:11,320
another tv concept that I illustrate

323
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,429
to you because it was what led me

324
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:15,370
to the next step in my

325
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,279
knowledge of boves are the obligations

326
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,070
of the fire that are objects that

327
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,029
we can use to  we are buzzing

328
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:27,340
access the information of the system

329
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,668
in a quite unusual way or

330
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:37,929
going back here we saw before the

331
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:41,440
function on which I was working had

332
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,250
this identifier that if you see

333
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,360
here it is and as you see him of a as

334
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,010
a given type then of in a bit smes if as

335
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,350
we say this this orientation

336
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:14,360
the object can be cast and

337
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:21,620
then to let's say recover an object

338
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,650
of  type iii d i can also take

339
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:31,580
any number and easy cast

340
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,720
once i have i already toy by ekk hotel

341
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,669
present that in boxer unlike the

342
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:41,360
database from claudio from hell functional

343
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,880
so if i tell him to select a

344
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,400
data in this case obviously  it must

345
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,960
be a constant or something that

346
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,919
establishes a given he however does not

347
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,909
make a turn melo from what

348
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:58,880
I noticed in the use of borges is that

349
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,520
for example by casting away and then

350
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,880
areas impose that an object teeth fire

351
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,419
came out was  out the description

352
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:14,409
that is if you go to get it here

353
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,330
if you go to make the query you see that

354
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,710
the problem is count trunk but at that

355
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,340
given linen

356
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:40,100
now we see a tap away but

357
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,320
we hope ch  and these are stable as

358
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,769
you can see if I make a query and through a

359
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,409
if read between directly on the table

360
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:55,429
the data comes out to me but you can

361
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:58,220
access a thousand alternatives by

362
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,570
indicating that a certain number is a dvd

363
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,679
and then casting this oi  of a

364
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:11,480
dei bros I get in the name of the function

365
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,330
that is represented by that

366
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,429
system identifier and the beauty is

367
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:20,779
that I can also ask him to give me the

368
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,730
complete signature of the function, that is,

369
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,480
with the parameters also

370
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,179
we go back to our slides and go

371
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,419
on

372
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,390
the nice thing that then one

373
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,820
of today's arguments is the fact that I

374
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,549
can indicate these casts I can

375
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:50,830
customize them so just as I did

376
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:55,400
a custom data type I can also

377
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,130
customize the cast it is a bit of a play on

378
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:07,040
words for example returning to the example

379
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,309
of first stop in time

380
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:11,630
obviously we all have to

381
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,820
deal with the file

382
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,410
extension convention because it was never a good

383
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,919
idea but like all good ideas then

384
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,140
they can't be applied  i

385
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,750
everywhere we need

386
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:27,590
the file extensions little effort you create

387
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,700
a data type game utd point do

388
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,020
the stations

389
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,700
even here all the

390
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,520
extensions that interest me are enumerated

391
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,290
and this is also a type of data that

392
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,860
I can use the interesting thing is

393
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,179
that  I can make a function that

394
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:50,360
makes me make it possible for me to

395
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:56,210
cast the main time and the file extensions and

396
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,590
what I wanted to show you was

397
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:01,070
very simple I introduced it can't

398
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,960
great but it seemed necessary to

399
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,720
get to understand the passage

400
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,290
then I  I say here who is a cast who

401
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,040
wants to

402
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,040
let's say convert or mind time into file

403
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,100
extensions useful as I told you is

404
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,120
simply a space that the fact that

405
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,890
there is only to avoid duplicating the

406
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:38,020
name and what I say that when

407
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,650
he runs into  this in this

408
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,550
conversion must call this

409
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:50,230
function here that with great imagination I

410
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:53,230
called file extension which takes as

411
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,180
a parameter a main type and obviously will

412
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:05,700
return someone  or that it is starting

413
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,860
exactly of ice man show

414
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,340
the function this here that net

415
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:24,110
we are all the things that cilices plant

416
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,790
to make messages that have on terror

417
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,330
etc.

418
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,610
however in reality the heart of the function

419
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,680
the heart of the function is quite

420
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:41,010
simple basically there are  a

421
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:41,600
simple

422
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,790
[Music]

423
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:55,440
is a simple church that I am only

424
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,039
going to indicate for each but in type

425
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:04,299
which is the corresponding file extension to

426
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:12,609
be returned so I double reader

427
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:15,330
allowing

428
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:25,450
you should by now be familiar with

429
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,539
this syntax of posi grace so here

430
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:31,869
I take an application  of the pdf a

431
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:36,460
string and I cast it to utility

432
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,119
point mime type note that the

433
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:42,609
castle implicitly plays posner because it is

434
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:45,159
a huge string and therefore he gets by he will

435
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,389
say instead of the projector

436
00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:52,059
that I don't really

437
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:54,090
want

438
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:57,999
to get by, which I want to point out to you  as I want

439
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:00,429
to point out that the name of the column is

440
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,009
mime type but also the data type

441
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:08,499
becomes mindstyle if I don't put the c  ast

442
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:12,099
that is, if I only select the

443
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:15,039
string to dylan who does not give me the name

444
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,330
of the column but the type of data and

445
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:26,470
text by casting it instead becomes

446
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,659
a type or the confirmation that fi through

447
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:32,369
the conversion took place

448
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:37,029
what happens if I indicate a value  of mine

449
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:39,399
type that is not foreseen by my type

450
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:44,979
given as it is logical to expect mib

451
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:47,249
gori my grandiose error that signals me

452
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:49,809
the syntax for the numbering but in

453
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:52,840
moles it is not valid and indicates to me

454
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,720
application xxx

455
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,759
I must say that even here

456
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:01,549
much clearer than all  the senses

457
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:04,809
produced that I have known because

458
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:09,619
error messages in almost

459
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:12,169
all cases are understood and there is also

460
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:13,759
some rare case in which it also gives you an

461
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,899
incredible right suggestion the

462
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:20,359
same thing obviously also applies to the

463
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:24,829
pdf point that is you can see me returning

464
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:29,899
the  like they give that is file extension and

465
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:33,619
even here one goes away that does not

466
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:36,099


467
00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:42,519
exist at this point

468
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,680
here is what we do now we

469
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,550
do our great but in time

470
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,190
and then what to them  ttacchiamo book to

471
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,560
see if the conversion is triggered we

472
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,550
attach a cast to file and station

473
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:05,570
then trace here it is

474
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:10,920
he automatically took the string

475
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,880
and brought it to the data type mindstyle and

476
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:23,250
then converted it through the fil

477
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,250
larsen through that function that

478
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,890
we have seen before it converted it and it

479
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,270
returns us to the pdf point of

480
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,970
course we can also go into

481
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,270
recursion it does not make a twist

482
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,210
that is if we go to make humanity and a

483
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,040
file extension and then we go back to all my

484
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,840
time gualano it returns it does not tell us what the

485
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:57,330
[ __ ] you did  but if he does it he does not know

486
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,480
that we do not live there and we always get

487
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,310
the confirmation on the confirmation

488
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:14,490
obviously as well as the cast from

489
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,559
mai in tag between the stations you can also do it

490
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:22,000
from file extension we do not

491
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,500
even see it in detail because

492
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,509
I am never  analogous obviously must have

493
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,610
another function that will do the opposite

494
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:32,350
instead of receiving input the film and

495
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,380
type to return feinstein show

496
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:40,720
station will in fact return ok of the sla

497
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,250
tones c  he we have already spoken in reality

498
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,639
so

499
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,830
here at a certain moment in my life there

500
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,770
is a light bulb of jesus and I said

501
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:59,810
cabbage but a table is a type for which

502
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:05,060
I could also put myself there and make a

503
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:10,310
cast for example to move let's say

504
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,620
convert a  integer in

505
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:22,990
in a table let's see what happens at the

506
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,520
end

507
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,410
let's say this is called

508
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,860
yes I will show you at the end

509
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,360
this look up function is called

510
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,660
which is very simple only to

511
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,410
take all the row of the

512
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,380
table which has as an identifier which

513
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,410
then I go to choose  I on which column to

514
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,830
go and look for it and I return everything

515
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,970
ok as a table type in this case

516
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,760
schools

517
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,520
as you can see I would say that the code

518
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,100
very little compared

519
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,840
to the power I am going to

520
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:20,820
develop therefore in the project we are

521
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,600
going to use as you can

522
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,320
imagine

523
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,230
in the schools table there are all

524
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,680
schools that have an electronic register,

525
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:36,000
therefore a length axis, if you do it

526
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,470
right, maybe a select does nothing

527
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,530
but

528
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,250
the problem  is that I do not touch anything

529
00:33:54,250 --> 00:34:02,770
so many resources but if I know this then

530
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:08,790
toia we cannot not know how many of 4

531
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:15,768
trivially maybe all unravels in less

532
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:22,339
or we change hdmi we hope not if

533
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:24,018
we change even less according to the

534
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:27,848
same we find on that other

535
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,489
the modes  photo 5

536
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:43,489


537
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,210
we can never cure directly because

538
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,040
you need to take it for

539
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,399
recording

540
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,670
twenty minutes to create pathos ruined

541
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:19,250
by he pulled out the golden ones to

542
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,810
put it on the one before this point

543
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:51,279
we leave our women

544
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:00,119
problems bullock of which at least a

545
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:06,140
little we support for others  5 minutes

546
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,690
is not very nice of lime you see it

547
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,530
when you go home

548
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,440
thanks

549
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,900
ok

550
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:01,130
give an exactly of the modern paths

551
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,869
of the pants and finally the pants

552
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:08,599
here it is then we were left at the

553
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,789
war that they return to us list of

554
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:15,410
institutes of our system and here I wanted

555
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,680
to show you how  in the school

556
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,199
there is the value that identifies

557
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,819
row 1 228 961 so if I do

558
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:29,029
the one which is an integer  and I do a cast

559
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:32,390
at school and the 47 schools which is the

560
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,839
given type of the table

561
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,660
here comes the row of the

562
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:43,160
table and it is something in my opinion is very

563
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,349
convenient because it saves describing a bit

564
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:49,249
and in some situations it allows you to

565
00:37:49,249 --> 00:37:51,769
maybe solve the matter  more

566
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,269
simply from the point of view of

567
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:55,219
performance in my opinion it is not the

568
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:57,979
misunderstanding with a beautiful john but it

569
00:37:57,979 --> 00:38:00,519
has its purpose

570
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:02,900
I also do those that 28 9 on our

571
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,390
no maybe think that someone has put

572
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:09,400
the iv directly in the function

573
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:11,989
the interesting thing is that then this  it is

574
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,689
a type of composite data that I can

575
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:20,179
also go to select the type

576
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:21,499
given that interests me in this case the

577
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:25,059
description rather than seeing it as

578
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:28,099
we say a series of columns going to

579
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:32,569
take it with the classic asterisk

580
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:35,059
obviously the thing works for the

581
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:37,759
table of the  schools but for example

582
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:39,340
it also works with the

583
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,530
obviously cascading with these there is the

584
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,410
table of which I have made those two

585
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:47,590
four rows of  first code for which

586
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:53,080
for example we see that here in the school it

587
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,200
is indicated which is the subject

588
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,740
that is intended as a subject of

589
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,800
conduct, that is, it is necessary to know among the

590
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,960
subjects of the school which is the one that

591
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,520
indicates the conduct because it is the one that

592
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,210
does not have the marks  written oral etc. but

593
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,470
there is only the single grade

594
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:24,220
ok so since that datum refers them

595
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,350
to the table is a datum

596
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,770
to stop from the table of subjects

597
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:32,590
what I do here I go to get melo and

598
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:35,020
do a cast to the table of

599
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:44,230
subjects and  I get the conduct that in

600
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,960
turn I can let's say explode in the

601
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,420
various with in the various subjects and in fact

602
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,600
from the description of the conduct and I can also

603
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:58,230
obviously issue put together

604
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,480
now in this matter here in this in

605
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,170
this way here

606
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:13,259
one last thing and then

607
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,540
I can make a balance sheet on them  also of the

608
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,450
operators

609
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,880
here too the syntax quite

610
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,270
simple I tell them what this to the right what

611
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,090
that left from a name the operator

612
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,800
I can do you will want it for example of the  the

613
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,350
sum I give the function that must do in

614
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:39,390
everything as in this case where I am going to

615
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:42,480
define a number in base 34 which is a

616
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,960
number that I simply need to

617
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,690
be a kind of

618
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,330
alphanumeric progressive but because I have to stay

619
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:58,730
tight avoiding using the

620
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,380
di  lowercase so I want to use

621
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,340
only the names from 0 to 9 and the letters from

622
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,490
capital z without iii and without laura

623
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,280
so I do only with a rule

624
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,430
expression when fast because sent

625
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:22,220
that I'm out of time

626
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:31,219
so even here I do the classic

627
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:32,269
syntax

628
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:35,150
as  it is long and maximum 12 if you put

629
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,519
one more was truncated what I

630
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,229
want to show you is that following she

631
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:46,729
tells me that and I violate the rule of the control

632
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:49,999
of the characters of the beauty is that

633
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:54,339
having done then the operators

634
00:41:54,489 --> 00:42:01,180
if I do the selecta

635
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:22,100
this which  abcdg tells me

636
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,950
obviously with the glue if I do more than

637
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:31,970
one how logical to expect clg and what

638
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:35,450
to note is that she has been she passes

639
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,750
from j

640
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,980
these sliders I make them find d  where

641
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,390
they will tell me to put them and how to

642
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,860
switch I refer you to that of the

643
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,870
place which is excellent

644
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:03,410
the questions and we do out I hope

645
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,780
I was interesting in short

646
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,330
you had awakened him

647
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:13,348
[Applause]
