1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,069
hello everyone in this half hour

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,109
less than twenty minutes I will talk about data

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:08,910
science in python

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,940
I'm stefania del prete works topix

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,350
as a data scientist and we also organize

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,609
this course of four weeks

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,730
past machine in which I was able to

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,580
teach part of paitone data  science

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,340
is at the level of other data

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,769
science projects under topix which stands for turin

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,199
piemonte internet exchange I work more

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,500
free of meters than on the internet among

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,079
other things with continuous

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,719
collaboration with measurement lab home

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,809
lab which is an open source project with

16
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,910
different data  that can be, let's say,

17
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,180
extractable from the public

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,550
during my path studying data

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,059
science at the beginning I was using

20
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,520
my background

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,320
yes I lost the video the video is back

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:13,460
ok differences and thanks it is practically

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,530
still now it happens that it

24
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,979
is often used a lot in the scientific community

25
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,720
proprietary languages such as

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,710
matlab for this reason I want to

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,990
spread the word on pecu  liarity of

28
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,479
languages such as python and all the books and

29
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,590
open sources available to us

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,890
convinced at the beginning I used a from

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,360
previous knowledge

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,640
with this let's say passage

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,909
from the most algebraic mathematics to the

34
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:48,620
programming language I knew

35
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,900
from python I went back and I no longer have

36
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,960
a  side here in Italy there is then with an

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,360
excuse of it was both let's say at

38
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,910
the Italian conference then with that the euro

39
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,400
python in rimini where I also found

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,670
myself not a little san basso where for

41
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,480
several defaiance libraries non focus

42
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,209
is in fact a  'American non-profit association

43
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:17,300
developed by those

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,239
who had created these open

45
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,840
source libraries that we are going to see shortly and in

46
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,600
addition to financially supporting the

47
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,720
libraries and therefore the developments cor ad

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,950
cor developers that also supports this

49
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,140
track called then date which practically

50
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,420
are conferences in  we talk about data

51
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,630
science using open source is an

52
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,570
excellent resource because all the videos of

53
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,580
these then date qu  This data science

54
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,590
in python and other open source languages

55
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,239
and are published on the same

56
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,000
video channel and are all available these

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,790
conferences are usually either alone for

58
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,739
example there is then data london berlin

59
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,150
etc. or within

60
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,160
stage conferences and is  a great a

61
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,019
great reference point if a

62
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,080
person wants to start both

63
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,910
exploring data science for the first time

64
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,770
you know if he wants to go

65
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,680
explore much more complex concepts of

66
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,450
machine learning different projects so i

67
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,000
recommend all to go to their

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,250
platform these are some of the

69
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,560
projects  which are currently supported

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,680
let's go and see some if I'm

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,290
available if you want here now

72
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,970
time is short if you want pro balcony

73
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,840
libraries some projects I'm talking about

74
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,940
find me here or more or less all

75
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:43,130
installed a project I was

76
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,780
talking about yesterday with a person  interested and

77
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,310
jupiter the jupiter project

78
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,000
at the beginning we talked about python are

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,250
just notebooks that in some

80
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,250
examples to provide how how yes how

81
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,990
yes how yes as you can see in short and is

82
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,270
based on the concept of the apple that a

83
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,740
person can directly go to the

84
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,020
terminal go use python

85
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,530
this cell-based notebook

86
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,900
once installed program you can

87
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,798
run on site lost practically  the one

88
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,390
that generates a file that is then

89
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,810
rendered by your browser and with the

90
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,480
development of new programs

91
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,970
penseur programming languages has expanded and

92
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,730
dassault jupiter was giulia python

93
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,760
earth headquarters see if name will continue to

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,820
lengthen with new languages

95
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,450
in short, now everything is very stable  if

96
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,860
also passed a new project called

97
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,620
jupiter lab in which you have direct access to

98
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,290
both the folders and the console

99
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,940
much more convenient even for

100
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,800
sharing projects recently

101
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,200
also google has done with the breeze in

102
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,950
which it also reads these jupiter notebooks

103
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,849
for historically

104
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,139
the  file extension remained the

105
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,929
same so aipai nb ai python

106
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:11,399
notebook and reads  also these

107
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,439
files I got to talk with

108
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,749
developed by google who said that

109
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,159
points are based on the project

110
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,229
to python to go to develop the

111
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:23,159
projects so you will see the date of

112
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:27,270
birth of these projects is also that

113
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,979
you have created so in this case pérez

114
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,559
has a physicist because I wanted to show you

115
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:34,849
how important multidisciplinary

116
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:37,169
multidisciplinarity in data science is

117
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,029
because often something that is forgotten

118
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:42,409
and also the knowledge of the context

119
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,089
in fact working with some data as

120
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:48,869
I must before mm a of the internet is

121
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:51,029
precisely in this internet exchange

122
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:53,580
in fact there are  a lot of

123
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,729
very detailed parameters withdraw tt i don't know if

124
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,400
any of you

125
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,320
the game call with data on the internet it is

126
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,130
very important to also have a person

127
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,720
of knowledge in the context to go to

128
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,880
develop it

129
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,110
because go to develop go to

130
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,690
draw the most important knowledge for

131
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,900
the  a project that is doing a lot first

132
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,360
of all with a couple and then not the birth is a bit

133
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,880
of this one of these responses

134
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,949
to the need for an open

135
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,680
source tool in the scientific community was born

136
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,880
at the beginning still as a numerical one and then it

137
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
was developed much more through

138
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,199
years ago even in what later

139
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,680
became officially you can't on the

140
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,720
slides that we can then share  I

141
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,220
always put the link also directly

142
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,080
repository on tab

143
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,770
because if you are welcome to contribute

144
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,180
if any of you know python if you

145
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,740
want to go implement libraries

146
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:55,090
and it is also very interesting to note that

147
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,370
maybe many of these things

148
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,280
can obviously be done in native paint on only

149
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,930
that these libraries make life easier a

150
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,720
device in particular as I

151
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,490
mentioned before hardy its already

152
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,250
implemented a concept of

153
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,449
algebraic vector notation python it is not

154
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,970
natively but through not then

155
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,580
many things can be done for example

156
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,409
once the library has been imported you can

157
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:24,860
directly pull dimensional vectors

158
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,979
with 09 etc.

159
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,539
in particular it is very powerful  for

160
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:32,990
general also noomi that random which

161
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,110
is not as trivial as an algorithm you can

162
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,409
go to create matrices and with it you

163
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,990
can go and do all

164
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,320
matri cial operations already inside in a couple

165
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,710
this is very powerful because then it is

166
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,950
also used maybe in some

167
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,560
type processes of machine learning which

168
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,850
or neural networks in which maybe tonight

169
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,380
we are talking about

170
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,090
algebraic systems where we need

171
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,940
this mathematical support first of

172
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,370
all to start this journey

173
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,840
let's say in science what we

174
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,220
need is  a dataset and here I have reported

175
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,480
some examples

176
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,010
in particular this one of cagol cagol I

177
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,630
do not know if any of you practically know it

178
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,710
is a platform where

179
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,480
different companies can publish

180
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,450
some data they challenge

181
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,610
people in quotes to find a solution to a

182
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,830
problem this is then calibrated  at the

183
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,990
level of precision of the algorithm on the

184
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,650
data and there are some rewards etcetera

185
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,350
etcetera and very very good an  that

186
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,390
as seen above all because it starts

187
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,040
because these data are already clean

188
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,050
data they are easy to use

189
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,730
here brought as an example of this

190
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,070
happiness frank which then I saw that to

191
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,460
see in the next examples some other

192
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,470
examples are the data of NASA

193
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,170
government data such as  used to be there

194
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,070
sometimes they are all exposed I share a

195
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,530
lot known now said in the

196
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,670
top of

197
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,270
before sometimes you have to talk for a moment

198
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,520
with people to get the data that whoever

199
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,250
you want and to go and discover it to understand a

200
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,710
little better for example some

201
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,650
harp data  I remember he is an acton on the

202
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,020
climate and there are people of

203
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,250
the harp who asked him something they

204
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,170
immediately directed you to the right resource

205
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,470
because maybe some sites or municipal TVs

206
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,530
maybe they are not user friendly

207
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,950
the wine part is not the

208
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,110
best part  of the site, however, by talking to

209
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,880
people, it is then possible to obtain as

210
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,160
what you want

211
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,010
some data known as commons

212
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,990
commons in the sense that it is not only given

213
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,720
if  t but the population itself

214
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,190
contributes to create the dataset and

215
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,600
some examples are just open street

216
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,670
maps of these spoken before in which many

217
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,560
attributes and much richer than

218
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,220
google maps you want and as boys that

219
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,930
concerns a mozilla project that

220
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,490
collects entries for then  go and

221
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,950
analyze at the level of

222
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,810
speech recognition again tonight if someone

223
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,400
stays because they don't speak no more

224
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,550
other agents are survey this sense

225
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,650
follow your instinct

226
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,280
i trust that sooner or later it comes back is

227
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,750
practically this was of st.veit

228
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,370
reason that a movement that

229
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,560
absolutely excellent if someone

230
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,390
interested just talking about something

231
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,880
that interested me with a huge survey

232
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,460
with lots of answers you want a

233
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,190
survey is rather complicated but by a

234
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,960
lot of data so if you address

235
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,480
your priorities very good the last

236
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,880
option not the last loved one in these

237
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,580
examples and dataset files only so

238
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,730
maybe if you use some experimental help services

239
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,690


240
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,390
yesterday we were talking about  a

241
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,410
device to measure brain waves

242
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,510
etcetera is practically you can

243
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,870
create our own data center to measure

244
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,850
then we found our data

245
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,210
set

246
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,620
let's start exploring it a library that by

247
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,410
now well known in the world of data

248
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,700
science and pandas pandas allows us to

249
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,100
convert most of the

250
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,530
known files  like what we find

251
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,600
around can be csv jayson files

252
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,120
even ex ella sometimes in short levels of

253
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
open sites you find any type of didactic

254
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
in the guise of converting them into an

255
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,840
uninformed lake called panda state frame and

256
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,390
then going to manipulate it add

257
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,580
takes the columns make statistics on the

258
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,780
spot  and it is very very powerful for

259
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,060
some situations maybe with two lines

260
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,440
of python you can say go and

261
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,420
see maybe the first lines so in

262
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,980
some cases it could be useful

263
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,140
directly command lines novelty

264
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,000
etc.

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,770
this operation usually with 56

266
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,960
licheri command is a command line  in

267
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,090
pandas more or less

268
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,030
here too I put it there  and resources to

269
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,320
go and see

270
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,200
in particular

271
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,200
the community one stands at this in this

272
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,720
case he was a west caning statistician who

273
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,300
still chemistry still involved in the

274
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,100
development in particular what

275
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,500
happened and that was a

276
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,730
world sprint in which we

277
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,090
also participated in turin also  in different cities

278
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,370
some examples are the conversion of a

279
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,000
dictionary flooded frame these are

280
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,860
other examples in which

281
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,040
an anonymous lambda function can be applied this

282
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,680
example we can also talk about it after

283
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,540
that example is an example of statistics

284
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,620
also we have all the data together then

285
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,140
we start from the part of  visualization

286
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,310
seen the area so I gave

287
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,790
a final acceleration, however, panda

288
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,280
is a large group that is continuing

289
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,500
to develop by continuing it seems

290
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,350
sprint and so I suggest you

291
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:18,680
take a look

292
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,570
if you want to go to contribute in

293
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,700
particular that world sprint was

294
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,770
on the doc  strings which are the

295
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,290
definitions of the functions and had a

296
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,630
bunch of ten pe  rsone it was very

297
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,250
nice to introduce people

298
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,380
and open source for the first time in fact

299
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,720
there were both curious fits scientist

300
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,340
knew lido via i had never

301
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,740
contributed thinking if one thing up for

302
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,750
sky with from the subtlety in the spoken a little

303
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,810
the process  the fort of the pub someone

304
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,640
had ever seen me so I

305
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,890
recommend it as an option to

306
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,230
sprint with your community libraries

307
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,320
in short projects of different types it was

308
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,450
very very nice as a project and the

309
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,310
library par excellence to go and

310
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,540
develop statistical fund graphs and

311
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,000
marco club but could of slimming

312
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,460
has been developed here too

313
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,890
logically puts a person but as

314
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,660
you can imagine it is always the contribution of

315
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,180
a community of

316
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,020
developers who continue to

317
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,850
contribute

318
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,430
the biologist who

319
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,880
has not given a lot of time unfortunately

320
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,290
there has been a let's say a prize to the  on

321
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,170
his behalf he was persuaded by a group

322
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,950
of people studying with an

323
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,810
epidemic episode study  using

324
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,820
these types of trend graphs of the

325
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,070
very interesting information

326
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,890
here too you can go to contribute some

327
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,959
examples that this clear not hook

328
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,399
possibility of having it snippet of these

329
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,470
libraries qt an example in which we

330
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,820
use a bit to create let's say

331
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,580
our two vectors that can be

332
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,649
used with trigonometric functions

333
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:10,160
and and here we say that macro club

334
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,420
many of the parameters used

335
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,220
are very visible

336
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,529
there is something by default is very visual

337
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:22,430
visible let's say a library built

338
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,100
on wordpress libe seabourn which instead does

339
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,800
more the VAT on the attractive part so

340
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,900
if you have to  talk from the project side

341
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,430
etc. to present your project

342
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,100
maybe it's a little more you think let's say

343
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,950
and here is a gallery of some examples

344
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,470
of graphics that can be done and very

345
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,270
powerful even when you

346
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,000
want

347
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,500
graphics together for example a shot

348
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,660
plot with the histogram of the two

349
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,180
variables on both sides

350
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,500
also here next strahl of other

351
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,649
examples also in itself

352
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:58,459
To conclude I wanted to mention for

353
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,939
completeness these free ones at the level of

354
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:05,360
dynamic graphs that there is mouths that a

355
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,579
book away very very interesting plus

356
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:09,500
also put a link to the gap mind if

357
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,730
someone has seen it and there is this

358
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,889
statistician who moved precisely these

359
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,379
pallini this plot on the

360
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:19,220
lifestyle compared to the gp to the

361
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,959
gross domestic product of different states over

362
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,939
the years and has been

363
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:25,040
completely reproduced even with mouths only with

364
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,860
the ngal pt axes and then eventually there is

365
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,889
also three js in the javascript library

366
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:37,220
that  I mention why they are creating

367
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,680
bindings between the two libraries with boe

368
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,050
that also bo which is based on a

369
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:46,120
visualization on localhost so

370
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,040
let's say it is usually used a lot

371
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,939
for graphics directly on

372
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:54,500
websites when a person wanted to

373
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,790
go

374
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,730
deeper is right for  mention them cyclone

375
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,220
here you see the documentation the

376
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,840
documentation cyclone done very well

377
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,730
are people want to learn jaws

378
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,800
can do it directly there  heed the

379
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,390
street frequentation that can

380
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,890
help correct it tens of law and

381
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,230
neural networks that remains even

382
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,260
easier and based on ten on flop and then

383
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,190
twists that of pleon inter

384
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,680
on python to also optimize the

385
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,150
gpu level and with this we say

386
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,040
completed a little  lymph of nature of those who

387
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,110
want to start a project in python

388
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,180
I am available this afternoon if

389
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,040
you want to see any of this

390
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,500
library or if you have any questions right

391
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,120
now I am happy to answer you

392
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:49,770
thanks but as

393
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,530
time ago it puts a ball

394
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:08,890
if you have questions about anything not me

395
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,350
liked it a lot but it always terrifies me

396
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,590
a little because there is the world of things so

397
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:19,120
maybe I find myself having done some

398
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,580
scripts to have processed some data

399
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,940
etc.

400
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,830


401
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,410


402
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,860
that is, however, even as documentation

403
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,140
there are infinite worlds because then each one

404
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,120
to write the documentation a bit

405
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,490
so in the end not to pe  get a

406
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,220
bit of the itinerary that you suggest wanting to

407
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,860
learn something you need then you

408
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,900
already use python what is your

409
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,350
language yes yes it is one you like a

410
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,450
lot but I am not

411
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,220
able to define I made a library

412
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,679
that is maybe even the  script I create

413
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,390
functions to etcetera

414
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,720
only that every time having even the little

415
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,390
time every time he goes there for example

416
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,830
in the case of asthma breakdown also all the

417
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,730
other libraries that is mentioned it is a bit

418
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,010
difficult to trace a path

419
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,860
of performance then I can  tell you two

420
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,210
things for

421
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,840
sure it is excellent to start with

422
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,000
an idea of what you want to do because

423
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,440
at the beginning I personally saw myself

424
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,660
in the approach I believe on what is easy or

425
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,970
learn everything while instead for what he

426
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,950
did for my curiosity he went to

427
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,020
open source  del no sorry

428
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,640
nasa open data i downloaded to a

429
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,620
leveraged dataset which are

430
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,440
outboard space missions and started to

431
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,060
fiddle with that once i chose

432
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,540
the very jupiter n tip  otebook

433
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,610
because practically you can see the

434
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,230
history of all your experiments you

435
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,620
do

436
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,130
so you can start in important piles

437
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:59,380
your dataset then on by age I

438
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,510
mentioned earlier there are some

439
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,280
very well done tutorials that are quite step up

440
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,140
step for topix where he works

441
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,710
I  did a course through the region if

442
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,980
we have done immediately date and the elections

443
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,380
at the moment on notes so if you want to

444
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,630
password life psi then more or

445
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,690
less deal with questions is a cost 40 hours 20

446
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,660
minutes and that could be a

447
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,640
good thing to start learning  the

448
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,510
libraries

449
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,740
therefore certainly illustrates advice

450
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,180
because then a story of your project you

451
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,820
see how the development and then

452
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,830
go back and improve once

453
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,280
and then also leverage on what you know

454
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,780
for example for a speed test project

455
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,230
by offline that case I had seen  that

456
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,000
what I wanted to see was always a

457
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,860
certain characteristic so I made a

458
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,350
function that made me the plot

459
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,720
exactly as I wanted it you understood what

460
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,310
you wanted c  ambiare mtv has as its argument

461
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,800
only those attributes and it could and

462
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,300
speed up a lot of the process so

463
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,400
in fact the long part then slowly

464
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,060
go to compact a sequel by improving

465
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,390
the project and if the questions are

466
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,830
available each question also helps those who

467
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,830
teach so then more or less I would say

468
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:23,780
this as  path to know if there is a

469
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:29,590
question also during the part otherwise

470
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,260
thanks

471
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:40,519
[Applause]
