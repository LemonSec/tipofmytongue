1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,290
so

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,450
well good afternoon everyone and thank you for

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,279
being here i'm mirko piccin i

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:08,790
work in fa bla bla castelfranco veneto

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,250
and today i'm here to talk to you about ross

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,219
ross is a very interesting

7
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:17,830
open source project linked to the world of

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,169
robotics both let's say point of view  of

9
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:22,000
two troubles but also from an industrial point of view

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,800


11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,669
we start with a bit of history on this

12
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:27,939
cross

13
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:31,149
then let's say it all started in 2007

14
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:33,399
when practically two guys had to

15
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,490
do a research doctorate and started

16
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,100
looking for their doctorate

17
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,670
obviously something around let's say already  published

18
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,010
on his robotics that is, they wanted to

19
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,300
do the first three a job was

20
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,060
focused on robots and find a

21
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,950
lot of material but we do not find

22
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,540
a common line in the material they

23
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,250
found if we find a lot of

24
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,320
interesting things also arrived also

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,970
working but materials that are not

26
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,440
able to rework because maybe

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,840
code written with the feet or because maybe

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,720
it was not commented just not e  at a

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,430
party they did not share a published one

30
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,479
and then who knows who did a project

31
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:09,280
maybe being a university he left

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,890
university he had given up everything

33
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,920
if practically 60 I realize that in all

34
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,300
these projects therefore linked to the

35
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,729
academic world and 90% of the time

36
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:20,710
spent as doctoral students or in any case  as

37
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,990
researchers he was always on rewriting

38
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,530
code ok it's only 10 percent he was on

39
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,740
innovation ok so they said yes

40
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,630
then if this question why we have to

41
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,090
every time it is easy anyway this is

42
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,190
one that they made them then

43
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,510
where to go to work this kind of

44
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,010
poster  to explain this concept

45
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,440
where this kind of dog sits

46
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,909
that bites the share of people who say

47
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:44,590
we do it new thing we are

48
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,030
looking for something I do not have it I write it from

49
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,740
scratch and then when it arrives you arrive at the

50
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,150
time to deliver you have to

51
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,500
appeal and then everything comes  let them

52
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,510
have abandoned a bit to themselves and

53
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,939
therefore practically their kind of king

54
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,460
this idea why not create  something

55
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,659
that is like linux

56
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,640
just robotics not something open

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,170
source but shared so that

58
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,280
everyone has a base to work on

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,960
so that you save a lot of time

60
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,700
doing simple things and you can work

61
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,110
on complex things make real

62
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,660
innovations

63
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,190
let's say it was also  the period in which

64
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,990
there had just been success of arduino

65
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,300
open source hardware in short channels and

66
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,210
our arduini are these goods loaded

67
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,470
and we do this thing here so the

68
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,060
thing did theirs they went to seek

69
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,470
funding because obviously if you want to

70
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,650
do something open source than  so

71
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,120
big let's say you need

72
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,770
some money in common because you also build

73
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,450
some powers to work on for example

74
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,190
i will be able to raise anything i'm like

75
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,900
50,000 dollars really because it's not going to

76
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,180
be a lot of doors but no one lady

77
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,100
financed them but with that money  they pull up

78
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,840
let's say build this first robot

79
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,260
which was pr 1 and this pr1 starting to

80
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,430
record videos where we

81
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,410
show what  it could be done with timetables an

82
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,000
open source robotics framework is

83
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,710
practically if you search the net

84
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,030
I have not linked them here but there are

85
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,580
links in the same location of the videos you see

86
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,810
this robot that empties the dishwasher

87
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,550
or that they remember the

88
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,560
playroom then  quite useless thing

89
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,360
but let's say it shows the wing just the

90
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,890
potential of what would have

91
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,380
been a well developed and

92
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,710
shared instrument and even with this robot they

93
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,480
could not do much of the truth

94
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,980
assuming that they carried around

95
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,500
they show them as they held it

96
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,900
nothing  really luck let's say arrival

97
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,730
luck let's say things took a

98
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,020
right turn when they entered the willow garage

99
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,660
which was a kind of spaces with a

100
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,550
gentleman the owner of saw space

101
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,020
to a person who had already given with

102
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,760
open source but also very

103
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,950
very big like google  for example and

104
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,320
knew a little which levers and move is

105
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,570
practically too they finally

106
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,030
understood that to be able to carry on

107
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,410
this project the first thing to do

108
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,120
was to create a real community

109
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,470
that is I could not do their job of

110
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,150
building an open source project and then I

111
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,320
share but then create the whole

112
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,450
community and then they started doing a

113
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,060
lot of community-related activities

114
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,070
apart from let's say  do try to do

115
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,380
conferences of courses if there was also a

116
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,760
very interesting thing they called all

117
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,250
those who had let's say already worked

118
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,290
on robotics projects that we have

119
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,120
shared something and naively limit it by

120
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,190
saying guys if we want to

121
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,860
make an open source framework for everyone

122
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,959
on robotics then you have  made of

123
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:06,709
your projects

124
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,420
try to evaluate together which of

125
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,160
yours is deserving and plan even

126
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,950
one of these projects and in the end

127
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,970
discussed discussed but it turned out that they

128
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,170
are the euro projects to be carried out

129
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,798
maxelà need to create a man

130
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,289
because not because he describes it to us  the

131
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:20,668
new all from scratch but simply

132
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:21,959
because each project have the

133
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,490
different license and theirs had  no instead

134
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,259
a real goal, that is a

135
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,240
precise work goal to create a

136
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,190
framework that could be used both

137
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,680
let's say by a private user and by the

138
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,270
university but also by a company and what to

139
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,319
do a product to sell

140
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,349
ok and therefore it is in fact decided to leave

141
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:39,300
from scratch precisely for reasons of licensing and

142
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,250
license that was chosen was the bsd

143
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,770
this to me the bsd 3 claudia in short caused

144
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,460
the ok but in reality still today I remember

145
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,469
this framework to this type of

146
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:51,330
license and then there are more than two thousand

147
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,099
plugins let's say developed by  other

148
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:54,419
companies other users who

149
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,830
also have different licenses obviously a stefano a

150
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,349
project by inserting different plagues

151
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:00,419
will then have to evaluate in turn the types

152
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,180
of licenses it is in short and they came to

153
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,039
develop the pr 2 which was a

154
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,740
more structured robot that more beautiful to see itself

155
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,830
already based on  this on the first beta of

156
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,719
this ros and we also do many events

157
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:14,370
as I told you including a

158
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,509
nativity scene at home this is the result of a

159
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,129
catone and in c  he is practically

160
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:19,050
called bermi the project that lived

161
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,370
this the room then I will put

162
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,810
they had planned to go and

163
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,389
get the beers to his credit one of

164
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,949
the things that can be done with

165
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:28,979
robots are in fact very useful but they

166
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,900
said for years these are themes that  this

167
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,550
robot cost like a few hundred

168
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,219
thousand dollars anyway it's easy to

169
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:36,449
say it's true but let's go open

170
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:38,009
source and then we use hardware that costs

171
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:38,969
so much

172
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:40,800
in reality let's say the project is on soft

173
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,060
I don't know lard and therefore their goal

174
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,440
was not to have low  cost but

175
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,150
despite therefore they worked on

176
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,069
projects that perhaps everyone's reach

177
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:49,009
especially even Maria from the university

178
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:51,900
hated research and developed this

179
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,789
as the first prototype for everyone let's say

180
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,050
that it was the turtle bot

181
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,120
this practically if you see well are

182
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,800
the things that you know them there  it is a kinect

183
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,069
ok that is above you can see it there is a

184
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,440
netbook practically and underneath they used

185
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,029
an e robot that practically a

186
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:07,830
ve  rsione more open than the

187
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,020
Lombard steal there is the makes robot eboli ferro

188
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,759
but I think it has a version that is

189
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,940
called robots is called

190
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,740
what these exponents are called practically

191
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,260
how many gods with a connector

192
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,060
to be able to detach so there is a

193
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,860
program of your own liking  so as a

194
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,330
basis they used that so really a

195
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,760
robot could go in this direction

196
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,320
then there was a netbook by code

197
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,420
that ran and then there is the kinect thing that

198
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,800
was used to do the

199
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,910
depth visions and then avoid the obstacles by

200
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,860
telling you  no starting from this

201
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,360
project then they are the way of the others

202
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,500
also many open source projects

203
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,910
that you still find now if you are looking for

204
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,540
pink open source type of o2 why are over

205
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,640
you find things like that where instead of

206
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,320
aruba what a few

207
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,940
hundred euros 1 puts  of

208
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,730
normal motors with

209
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,310
[Music]

210
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,530
let's say a driver of those that his

211
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,540
18 with arduino always uses the kinect and

212
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,190
instead maybe a rybery instead of using

213
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,900
a netbook ques  te things also run on

214
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,330
this hardware to always allow

215
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,790
precisely that even here as hardware

216
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,430
let's say the same ross ran on itself

217
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,200
to this look how on the first robot

218
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,760
only this I had was the 600 and 1000

219
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,290
dollars such a thing compared to

220
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,850
the hundreds of thousands  of dollars

221
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,210
first in 2013 then it happened that the

222
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,730
project passes from willow garage to

223
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,320
I think about robot merged ok in fact

224
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,210
now the whole red project is

225
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,370
charges and honors all of those in charge of

226
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,730
this foundation in 2013 in 2013

227
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,590
always in my 13  a few months later a

228
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,300
water also the industrial red is a

229
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,810
consortium or

230
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,610
universities and companies got together saying

231
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,810
at least this red is really powerful

232
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,040
because we cannot use it also

233
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,320
in industry that is for example to give us

234
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,640
robots they are still in the industry during the

235
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,960
day because  we cannot insert

236
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,490
this software in here

237
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,200
because otherwise I think all the advantages of

238
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,190
open source and then if you want we

239
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,170
list them and here  ndi in waters

240
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,550
this consortium now this consortium

241
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,640
with 60 and passes members and you see some

242
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,890
brands like bmw borsci 3m there is not

243
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,900
peanuts but what it means is not that

244
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,420
we enter here not always santorum nobody

245
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,830
sees anything touches me nothing in reality it is

246
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,600
all open  source also a stereo probe

247
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,310
and open source for example

248
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,440
let's do an example cook a fano

249
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,620
robotic arm and said well dear with software

250
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,090
or union i would like this

251
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,370
robotic arm maybe let's say

252
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,169
compatible as the ross ross framework

253
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:20,000
in desse says ok steps of the specifications

254
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,130
of this arm  its t a and

255
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,620
everything it takes to connect to

256
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,470
this arm the company provides

257
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,270
this information pays a

258
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,740
development brand because the company pays because

259
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,059
to have the compatibility of the

260
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,549
big arm this consortium develops

261
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,140
as obviously researchers say nothing

262
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,899
is connected that  the university is this

263
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:40,130
this new plugin and then

264
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,450
its first open source is released

265
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,740
then practically  and just for example

266
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,330
we wanted to understand how a

267
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,240
52 thousand euro treatment arm works

268
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,300
I don't know I say ok we could simply go

269
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,570
and download the plugin plugin

270
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,120
let's call it let's say the delegated module

271
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,310
this arm to have a

272
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,230
simulation ball the arm with all the

273
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,950
characteristics however  embers or therefore

274
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,589
all the speed limits of the axes

275
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,060
themselves because there is also a

276
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,560
ros simulation environment and therefore we can

277
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,070
work

278
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,470
on say on this virtual hug for

279
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,760
two months and then say okay I have

280
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,720
developed an application this

281
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,580
arm I can go to a company that  hides

282
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,470
living this application you just need to

283
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,570
turn the key almost and the one who has

284
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,160
developed inally virtual cristofano

285
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,450
go in the real environment because in fact

286
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,520
the virtual destinations is practically biasin

287
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,209
hand in hand with the real one

288
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:30,290
if you want more information it can

289
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,550
be the symbol and so there are big

290
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,420
on each page

291
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,310
together they have precisely that now he

292
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,029
entered in 2013 entered n  she managed

293
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:39,589
maintained by open source urbatys

294
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:41,779
fondation and we say and go back to talk

295
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,250
that these guys want to do

296
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,630
something open source

297
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,070
now if we look there is a map

298
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,620
published on the users' ros site

299
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,580
we say this map and also a little

300
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,500
old I think and you see that in short

301
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,209
in short,

302
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,190
this framework is quite widespread

303
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,680
and in fact if we want some

304
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,029
numbers as is usually done when it

305
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:01,670
comes to the community we see that it

306
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,130
has practically in the money list 1,500

307
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,800
subscribers are more than 3,300 users

308
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,560
working on wiking ok  there are more than

309
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,930
5,700 thetes that we say there are that is

310
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,090
they ask questions or answer an answer that

311
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,830
always puts the form of managed by

312
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,810
this project and the wiki is more than 22

313
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,730
thousand pages that is to ensure that it is

314
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,430
mammoth there is a lot of material the

315
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,050
fact that  it is not I understand that

316
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,520
when one speaks of pesaro luino we say that

317
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,050
there is a way more than 22 thousand pages of

318
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,880
arduino projects if we search the net

319
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,260
for  It is one thing to look for a throne a

320
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,880
published project point to find a

321
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,170
tutorial ok and always explained below the

322
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,700
of a certain way with reference to the

323
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,590
kitab repository rather than to the

324
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,000
packages that you can download how to

325
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,680
use it how to compile it and so

326
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,340
on

327
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,810
and this is my of the  22 thousand pages

328
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,190
that have been published

329
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,260
ok validated then if you want we can see now

330
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,000
how in short heriberto on all these

331
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,590
things there is stau hickey beautiful

332
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,520
answers what kind of a kind of dvd

333
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,290
question answer to a tac and then certain

334
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,910
speech that is practically a forum

335
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,820
these  things are part of the

336
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,220
rosso rossa community it is in fact

337
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,370
let's say that the first release I think

338
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,930
was in 2010

339
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,670
now we have come so

340
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,500
far and never in ten years that in fact

341
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,480
there is a beta of this project and here

342
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,890
there is a link to a video

343
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,110
if you want to see it with practically all

344
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,520
colors it has been done in these ten years

345
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,020
so if from the point of view of research

346
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,310
then in universities that to

347
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,680
private users that to  even from its own consortium

348
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,910
rosso industrial present therefore they are

349
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,710
projects in motion children of robots that

350
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,300
we can see

351
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,940
maybe we see 2 to 2 and a half minutes it does not

352
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,790
last long it is very little if

353
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,470
the network can make it if you can not make it it does not matter you will

354
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,810
not make it though  you have to repeat in the

355
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,190
slides and celli that then you can

356
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,420
look at it even after but that is a

357
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,160
sum of projects made both by

358
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,830
universities and it was however we are no

359
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,060
longer interested maybe the open source and

360
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,560
community side of this project well

361
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,750
this for example a photo of

362
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,700
published open source projects  by users and

363
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,950
managed not by companies other

364
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,290
than one of robotic arms for

365
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,900
example one and bull the other is the museum

366
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,830
of the 13 year old saying printable robots and

367
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,570
all compatible red and therefore

368
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,830
saying that we know this arm and

369
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,570
independent of the hardware we can

370
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,370
however pilot them with reds I do not

371
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,540
show photos of robert because any

372
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,100
rover that tends to

373
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,630
be driven with reds is an engine and an arduino board

374
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,340
and  we are

375
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,240


376
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,060


377
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,570
ready now I will show you the very hard fact that I told you that in fact any arduino rover

378
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,680
would be enough with any arduino

379
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,430
attached to say to the countries and

380
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,050
therefore it is called nature the order was

381
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,320
already out that just a rover with an

382
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,600
arduino would be enough to use  ros

383
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,610
let's see how we can sin

384
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,960
an arduino board I know it has

385
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,640
nothing to do with robotics but it makes us

386
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,710
understand a little confession framework ros is

387
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,440
an arduino board we are studying

388
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,260
what we can do very quickly

389
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,790
that is a first demo which is very simple

390
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,590
then  stop soon we will get a lot

391
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,380
more [ __ ] because there was also

392
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,420
simulation david with a rover is very nice

393
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,310
then let's go here and we have the

394
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:05,910
console

395
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,130
please take a good look at the passages

396
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,110
because in reality afterwards it is not that I

397
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,540
never shoot because later  I connect to I connect

398
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,900
now first we basically have

399
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,170


400
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,610
the master ok link that in the

401
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,220
red environment we have a master

402
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,450
ok then we have a series of nodes  that

403
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,990
connect ok launched from a console

404
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,709
see you part now with this beautiful

405
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:35,110
see how beautiful this this this

406
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,269
terminal can be expected so how I

407
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:40,630
like it is practically we launch another

408
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:49,829
command red van in red serial python

409
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:55,300
serial north of wight days

410
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,980
portray my hands are  excited and what the

411
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,120
heck cm 0 being practically with

412
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,350
left the chorus you see resorting

413
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,779
simply to say and this by saying

414
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:12,880
a red knot roanne then iran the no

415
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,899
of type rus serial python and then to two

416
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,130
economic parameters in pesaro strange

417
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,750
first makes me understand that there was  something

418
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,720
that serial of bull serial and that

419
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,579
cipher that python and then shows me that

420
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:26,800
the second one discovering that it launches

421
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,959
practically seen an executable that

422
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,220
inside this mode be in the

423
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,620
north because I am going to initialize a

424
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,420
serial mode by pointing to the port

425
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,459
adepti why ecm  0 which is practically the

426
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,690
door if you have always generated by

427
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,149
arduini once connected to the doubts can

428
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:42,100
stay here makes a lot of mess  enger that shows me how hot I sucks I

429
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,040
do so

430
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,790
ls

431
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,410
[Music]

432
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,160
of wine cm 0 we have 3 cm 0 that

433
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,019
I don't know about her anymore

434
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,029
ok throws them and connects to the

435
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,209
serial port at about 7.100 bau now

436
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:01,889
practically more what I have  fact probed

437
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:04,410
before today by other times before

438
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,269
today but gino redone went to the site

439
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:08,759
of red from wiki I looked for arduino and

440
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,300
plug in

441
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,399
I saw that there were serial arduino 1

442
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,430
download it installed through a

443
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,199
package not even compiled and then I

444
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,029
write to you how this thing  he is lent to

445
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:19,589
see me of the guide he tells me look for

446
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:20,850
this to download this of beer

447
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,379
shore duino loaded this for example

448
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,149
for example to publish all

449
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:26,100
the analogue pedestals this other for

450
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,180
digital ones that was to

451
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,620
command one of the cia etcetera

452
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,910
etcetera i am a  lots of examples

453
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,990
really

454
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,420
then i installed this this

455
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,920
block this movie on arduino and i

456
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,209
loaded the one to warm it wine and

457
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,220
launched this now as you can see i

458
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,660
launched this  node and it is happening to me

459
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,550
absolutely nothing can say that it is okay

460
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,949
so now we actually say that this

461
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:45,600
is a first part no there is because I will put

462
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,819
if it works that we have a node that

463
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:50,180
can connect to this master ok and

464
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,620
pass the information ok this first

465
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,819
passage to the second step that there is

466
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:54,810
someone else who for this

467
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,130
information to do something about it no

468
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,839
then the first thing we can do is to

469
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,910
say well we see this information

470
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,639
ok then we are lovers of the command

471
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,959
line so we say I recommend you

472
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:04,860
there will be a bike you want  information of

473
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,199
course we have now said that this

474
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,339
information is passed by the node

475
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,829
is passed with a concept that

476
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:12,240
looks a lot like a meeting I know that

477
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,189
it knows you there but we are talking about a topic

478
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:16,560
we are talking about publishing subscriber so

479
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,730
before this way it is publishing

480
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,980
information in a  specific topic

481
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,990
then use the command ros

482
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,500
topic

483
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,290
ok list lists the mice that are present shows

484
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,360
me there are these tops  i that

485
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,949
what I need is the one

486
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:31,410
I already know but in short we would have seen but he

487
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,990
dressed us usual setup publisher a I said

488
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,870
you see it also here ok so we have

489
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,040
this topic and it is called similar

490
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,329
we can do various things for example

491
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:41,160
say okay damage  of the information on

492
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,540
this adc index this of yes is of type

493
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,199
ro serial arduino slash ago I said ok and the

494
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,639
publisher to this series no henceforth

495
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,050
this what the publisher of these

496
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,670
funds this information this

497
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,470
formation has a certain type you know the

498
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,230
types in the  programming in integer

499
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,819
strings saying no in red and since

500
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:00,940
it is not that we can

501
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,460
number or a string but we pass votes

502
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,449
formations

503
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:05,650
there are data types that can be

504
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,180
built are the end of the

505
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,770
data structures little in this case the

506
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,240
unused team structure this eros serial

507
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,310
arduino dc and we can go and see

508
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,660
what kind of bad data we do ros

509
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:20,290
message ok info of this serial arduino

510
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,540
a yes it tells us that this here is

511
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,819
comp  It actually comes from six

512
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,920
16-bit integer data and therefore we can give

513
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,660
very in depth even with simple

514
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,190
commands and we understand what should

515
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,120
get there

516
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,220
now I have to do instead see what

517
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,630
is coming from arduino and here we can

518
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,360
always as a real stop  it

519
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,280
we make a nice echo that they are also with

520
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,670
linux linus this we do that we want to

521
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,190
see the topic a of sim and

522
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,840
see that it keeps shooting me is

523
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,190
constantly updated

524
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,400
let's say if lines from of c0 of c5 ok

525
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,180
with data

526
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,710
I actually code them  modified

527
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,030
because it did not pass the data of the other

528
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,830
five analogue PDs because I connected they

529
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,510
are potential throw but you turn this

530
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,680
potential you will find that the value

531
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,850
changes want enough arduino code the

532
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,790
serial is the same yes it is not true and true

533
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,860
but these data we can take them you can

534
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,810
do something else  what a lot of

535
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,110
stuff

536
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,610
the simplest thing you need to do

537
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,440
besides display them real is to

538
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,880
say okay says we can do to

539
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,760
see them in  fought way no they are

540
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,160
ready which allows you to see the data

541
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,870
as they arrive here we make

542
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,909
tv networks

543
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:28,570
prot is no longer a prot platoon

544
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,210
and then we launch this practically it is

545
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,249
one of the turks are present in red

546
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:35,499
based on the qt libraries in this case

547
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:36,690
we have

548
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,520
this serves  to fight data so

549
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,960
this case says it's okay that mice

550
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,880
we want to see adc we said no

551
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,280
here it is we have from dc from 0 to 5

552
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,770
we want to remove everything except the dc 0

553
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,250
we do not need high we could launch it

554
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,990
pass a nice parameter now it is

555
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,670
a  new life potentiometer that

556
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,470
practically I'm going to fight the data

557
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,870
coming from serial and this is a

558
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,280
stupid thing to do but interesting

559
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,780
but that allows you to have a

560
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,920
very very simple tool to

561
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,420
see the data in real time

562
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,170
arriving

563
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,130
another tool that allows us  to

564
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,080
understand the logic a little and you can see that

565
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,990
the logic of di ross of

566
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,570
the communication structure could also go

567
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,210
this other tool that calls us if  mpre

568
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,960
rich base of its waste graf

569
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,750
practically allows you to visualize the

570
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,470
computational fat calls there is

571
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,420
practically the set of nodes that

572
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,650
communicate with each other then see that

573
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,480
we have series to the north this is the node

574
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,340
is sending on a topical yes the

575
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,500
information and to  this topical of has

576
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:31,980
registered

577
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,590
this this is practically this here

578
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,420
ok me when I said the data that

579
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,620
arrive and this represents me

580
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,240
exactly this other node every

581
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,590
circle no from every square a little

582
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,480
because if I close this video your

583
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,690
still and went back to look  this ok per

584
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,910
day what you see disappeared the

585
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,350
one after because it shows me in

586
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,760
real time the structure of the nodes that

587
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,930
communicate with each other puts you now

588
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,840
we have little nothing branch two nodes ok and

589
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,430
this is a first example because there is the

590
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,690
first of  then understand how to go on

591
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,310
then there is another more beautiful obviously

592
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,210
ok

593
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,210
we go back faster ok

594
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,830
ah yes I will show them on the fly this

595
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,110
that the list of pa  cchetti for the for

596
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,400
this type for this version of ross

597
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,050
dedicated friends to say that I was practically

598
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,240
go hand in hand with the lts of ubuntu

599
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,070
so every time there is a line

600
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,050
compensate for new contextually on

601
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,420
stage the elixir os x which obviously

602
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,290
red considered

603
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,240
a reliable tool and follows the concept

604
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,130
of the super as you can see we have

605
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,600
practically all the

606
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,000
pre-available distributions the ros

607
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,610
ok and we are now the kinetic and

608
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,780
the stable practically but it was

609
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,630
killed in novale tst precisely so it will be

610
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,040
stable and here  you see there are a lot

611
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,180
of drivers

612
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,670
sorry of package modules available

613
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,800
these all how many secrets names there is

614
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,530
each one is made by uncem antonio different

615
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,960
here these all how many open

616
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,160
source modules and if for example we go to see

617
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,760
here on cd camera ok this  tell us

618
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,070
what you think of to capture objects it is

619
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,330
okay first see this module when

620
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,210
we open it we enter this this

621
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,980
little page switch we click

622
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,450
on the  the inside of the website that the

623
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,250
ross wiki you see that we arrive in a

624
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,200
page where we have and this is the wiki page

625
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,460
I was telling you before this for every

626
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,140
package there is this but it goes there is this

627
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,240
you see there is the deposit link of  tab

628
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,670
ok it says how to install it how it

629
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,640
works public thing what services gives me

630
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,230
provisions parameters how to

631
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,850
use practically everything is

632
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,130
really there and moreover sorry again

633
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,590
useless ingua that is if possible also

634
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,409
follow us even on a lot of languages already

635
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:29,640
translated into many  so really

636
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,590
it's just a matter of reading

637
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,429
ok as you have seen he used the command

638
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,779
line which in fact, as I said before,

639
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:41,220
rosso not only follows the

640
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,700
ubuntu distributions but is based on linux practically

641
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,070
there is perhaps the new version the moon

642
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,720
if I'm not mistaken that it also runs  on the

643
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,370
mythology on a windows console of

644
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,750
census there is such a thing

645
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,850
something that crap like that but in

646
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,220
fact underneath and runs very well on linux

647
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,659
and also on arm platforms  so even

648
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,179
just point trees and in fact there is a

649
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,669
free adhesion and to program the nodes

650
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:08,669
and they are in fact good python

651
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:10,110
ec plus plus and therefore practically if

652
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,000
we want to develop a node that for

653
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,559
example takes the data derives from arduino

654
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,240
to move an arm  robotic su

655
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,799
based on potentially we could write

656
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,330
in python or igp the splash

657
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,740
quietly really in

658
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,080
plasma chip compiled in python you do not need

659
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,380
this also another

660
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,520
package another interesting way is called

661
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,570
rose bridge

662
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,179
ok that practically allows you to

663
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:31,049
publish through the web socket

664
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,520
through the  'contribution of syfy steep lei

665
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,799
pia with which you can when the three from

666
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,580
no connection of say or just

667
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,610
as cpp and then done in reality

668
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,809
we could program these languages

669
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:45,450
in short we have the socket just

670
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,340
connect to the port for example I know that

671
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,799
for brings 90 90 and  with

672
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,240
almost any programming that is java

673
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,970
javascript pills we want we can

674
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,049
interact with the system  a red this is

675
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,690
a bit of an image of a

676
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,730
pseudo-classic pattern of a red positive

677
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,870
obviously we now have a ruin

678
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,970
attached here in our graph we had

679
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,440
a square that did not mark a

680
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,789
circle that was the urban man who passed

681
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,169
the data through them seriously in  reality

682
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:11,730
in a normal project maybe yours you can

683
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,610
have a kinect which is a sensor so

684
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,820
it will be a node then have

685
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,909
a robot that moves our robot is

686
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:21,950
that is another node have a

687
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,299
robotic arm mounted on it and that is

688
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:25,940
yet another node and  on a pc and then there is

689
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,649
another pc still having that I know a

690
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:30,409
graphical interface to view the

691
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,700
data collected by the camera and so

692
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,450
on

693
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,889
the concept you see here is that even

694
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:35,120
here there are the squares council mice

695
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,610
community p2 and the nodes with the word pa  bc

696
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,610
sub you excavate practically everything with a

697
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,620
speech of the nodes that do one thing and

698
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,080
if the simple and good ok and

699
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,240
generate outputs or there were inputs

700
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,620
and then cannot put them together question

701
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,080
and things much more complex than

702
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,029
the mtv two star amy standard credits

703
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:54,649
we say because the

704
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:56,240
words of the friends of t are implemented a lot in this case

705
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,919
the master there is no goal to

706
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,389
initialize the communication between the

707
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:01,639
various nodes but he does not keep traces

708
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:02,659
of the  communication in the sense

709
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:04,610
that once node one says I have to

710
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,379
subscribe to this topic and that it is the top

711
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,389
of the hard last barriers the master

712
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:10,190
says look at that is the one

713
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,990
that generates that node ii iii cipolletti directly

714
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,549
other node the masters load comes  from the

715
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:15,440
masters it is really always very unloaded

716
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,019
and all the work we say of calculation

717
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:20,389
is used unloaded on the new one

718
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:22,250
so in fact if one has a camera

719
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,830
in depth and has to do processing

720
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,179
of no points obviously it must be

721
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:28,100
in armored machines it is not that the  must

722
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,529
where to do it do the same

723
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:32,570
there are then in addition to let's say

724
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,210
this species topography or hand mix

725
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,269
in short of knots top in saying

726
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:39,440
let's see antimo the s  instruments you have seen

727
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,940
there is the command line that rewards the

728
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,590
main instrument used with ross

729
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,870
then there are also free ones and of the

730
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,279
defense studies of the subtle we have seen a couple of

731
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,379
the pro telegraph that allowed to

732
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:52,100
block the data to make a competition

733
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,860
graf del  let's say the various nodes present

734
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,120
there is another very interesting

735
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,110
thing called

736
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,720
bag that save the bay which practically

737
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,090
serves to see and director of bad loans t

738
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,130
bag bag is like the handbag has not in

739
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,320
fact we can say well or connected

740
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,940
to the arduino board now  that I paid

741
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,679
for the Arduino board I start the recording

742
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,620
of a back and then I and how the

743
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,059
video recorder was turned on by putting the

744
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,190
rec and I now signs are I would have

745
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,870
boosting all the hits the

746
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,370
degenerative values figurines are saved

747
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,350
this beautiful then I close the bag that the

748
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,059
recording was lardin  and i go

749
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,950
home because the ruin is not mine but

750
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,179
cobain's house and now we are

751
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:28,980
robotic arm how do you control that

752
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,480
robotic arm  an arduino good I open it to

753
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,640
that quarrel and then

754
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,130
what I did before

755
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,809
in our red framework remains running as if

756
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:38,010
they had in attached if there are

757
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,570
potentials even if I don't have it

758
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,650
so this practically allows you

759
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,630
to play endless educational times

760
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,190
collected is used to make bugs

761
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,660
with one of the things we do not know

762
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,280
says I decided a bug left everything and

763
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,990
then it is analyzed at a later time to

764
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,740
answer and even in

765
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,910
slow motion let's say it as a

766
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,650
video recorder and then there is

767
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,850
integration with other systems

768
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,250
what does it mean  practically it is not just

769
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,840
command line and those waste

770
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,940
tools there are very fi tools such as gazebo

771
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,840
that is a practically business

772
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,990
simulator indoor outdoor simulation of

773
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,880
a that of robots and then we will see

774
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,500
right on gazzi a simulation we can do it

775
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:07,919


776
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,630
then there is integration with open city  that you

777
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,059
all know in short practically the

778
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,220
complete free vision as the most

779
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:14,970
famous Treviso in the world

780
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,770
then there is  the integration of shot in barrel

781
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,330
and cheater which practically is used

782
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,100
perception so if there is a 3d camera it

783
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,990
would practically elaborate out of

784
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,900
shape of point clouds to extract

785
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,840
objects or saying fi movie which is

786
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,090
another library really another

787
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,200
another tool  really cool that

788
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,540
allows you to do motion planing so

789
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,650
if for example we have a

790
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,720
robotic arm and we want the robotic from

791
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,590
point a to point

792
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,390
b usually how you work you work

793
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,070
with things that is I say this is the pose 1

794
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,419
these the pause 2 you have to  go

795
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:44,580
through the pose xy z because it must

796
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,390
avoid the obstacle

797
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,100
in reality we can say in this

798
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,929
system the robot must go precisely to the

799
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:50,850
point b and it is this motion planing that

800
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,110
studied ector who must follow the

801
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,820
robot so if for example a

802
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,740
depth chamber  in front of the robot and

803
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,750
I put a box in front of it this

804
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,179
is seen in real time planing of the

805
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:01,830
movement is changed considering the

806
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,650
state so

807
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,630
but it's a very cool as s  the system is very

808
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,730
dynamic obviously there is to do complex things

809
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,860
you have to give many nodes

810
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,300
you have to have some code but in

811
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,620
fact ok last five minutes

812
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,550
let's say that the right one has arrived

813
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,530
there is also a project

814
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,630
called rose in this project rosina is

815
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,940
a  project that is part of the project

816
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,890
does not exceed European constituent horizons which

817
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,060
because I am sources of financing

818
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,680
innovative projects and other things that I

819
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,390
do not know but in fact there are among the

820
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,120
millions of euros available for let's say

821
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,310
developments related to the red world so if

822
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,480
for example you have  a companies but

823
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,550
you also want to try to make a

824
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,170
training center on the bone I don't know

825
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,900
you can apply in this one in this

826
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,270
rosin you can have on the training that

827
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,330
in the 50 percent of I say

828
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,050
financing on the part let's say of

829
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,430
industrial projects I do not know

830
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,770
in short it is  open is still active here there is

831
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,260
also a link and that's all

832
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,580
now we have two minutes let's see the

833
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,890
simulation of the roverino

834
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,990
maybe you do  let's give duties

835
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,520
here is my email below this is also

836
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,490
the address of our fab lab anyway very

837
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,320
quickly we have an internship

838
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,440
at nothing we go back to our console

839
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,940
on our command line

840
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,470
ok let's go and see be we ask for

841
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,900
the rob card  arduino vb we close everything

842
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,510
let's go and see for example a

843
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,460
simulation then that turtle bot was

844
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,870
the first version suffered various versions

845
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,520
and having skipped the bot brings such a

846
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,630
big one and so we have it too

847
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,400
cool very funny but

848
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,930
obviously a needle from yahoo one  of cd and

849
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,370
in game you make it work before

850
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,770
simulation and then we see that there is

851
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,060
little a package for the simulation it

852
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,470
was quietly like this and sudo apt

853
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,660
get install and so on

854
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:43,570
the library so apt that show red and is

855
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,800
that now it risks some absurd stuff

856
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,070
you see there are a lot of ros packages

857
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,480
for vale is available it is practically

858
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,470
to add an absurd repositories and

859
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,750
we launch practically rossella is not there

860
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,670
because this is very p  more complex

861
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,840
carlton bot

862
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,200
the boobs to the bot also worked here

863
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,760
completed are obviously more stuff

864
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,000
there is a slower it is gazebo and then we are

865
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:24,020
ok we do sure botre world master

866
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,390
always active gazebo part of these

867
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,100
gazebos is a simulation mind so

868
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,800
practically we have ours  it is a

869
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,990
kind of simulated circuit and here

870
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,260
we also cannot turn

871
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,260
turn

872
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,700
there is a way to fight so you can

873
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,950
rotate and zoom you see this here it is

874
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,080
practically the simulated robot then

875
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,370
we also have the possibility of lire

876
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,140
well but to drive it then we have  a

877
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:53,180
cross runner and cutie robot ceiling if

878
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,810
I'm not mistaken robot squeezed that shot bazir

879
00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:00,040
meanwhile let's see sorry terhorst topic

880
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,600
list that all are there and you see that

881
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,800
a lot of mice have appeared there more

882
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,970
than before very negative a

883
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,410
gazebo but what is interesting because

884
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,840
I know by now it is that I enjoy this

885
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,190
practically a topic and it serves to

886
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,430
command, let's say, robot that its wheels are

887
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,020
always the topical one precisely because  it is non-

888
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,190
standard so if you make your own

889
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,960
robot make it work like

890
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,790
mice we go talk more mice

891
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,530
as a fact you see we have more makes you

892
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,140
give in horrors topic

893
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:29,000
info jamie lidell you see that

894
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,890
practically the type of data is a

895
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,350
greater trilingual is  ok so having

896
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,820
practically allows us to geometry

897
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,070
for values that allow you to move

898
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,380
and rotate a robot returning here

899
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,450
sorry but let's say this robot syringes

900
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,620
practically an apq and interface

901
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,870
retained to have a kind of

902
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,850
system to control

903
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,550
let's go back to the gazebo here we are back

904
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,770
open our  this the challenges that

905
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,420
move this course in the center

906
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,500
practically robot goes forward

907
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,130
back

908
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,140
ok this is a simulation but if you had

909
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,770
the real robot

910
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,210
a different command is forbidden now you are

911
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,910
driving a real robot ok this

912
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,530
allows you to do a lot of

913
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:13,090
interesting new now  tell me if it is

914
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,250
lime light certainly now costumes

915
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,690
we have brought it because I am there

916
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,090
ttiamo 4 hours but they put it down there is

917
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,830
around the pilots process interface

918
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,270
because the topic he listens to he is

919
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,460
always saying became me is only not only

920
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,110
I want to show the last thing we will have to

921
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,700
see that it can be expanded to infinity

922
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,050
there  is who said okay but to

923
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,490
check why I have to use this

924
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,110
special crappy interface or

925
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,490
use a keyboard first use a

926
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,630
video game joystick

927
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:38,080
now there is that developed by table and

928
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,520
packages there is just that to use

929
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,580
the joypad that of the xbox though  there is

930
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,910
also flight of the wii and wii

931
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,260
then we can launch it quickly

932
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,720
because I don't remember commands then

933
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,820
ok so we first launch red

934
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,840
en

935
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,480
wii mote attention of the bike and we have to

936
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,240
launch the one for we would not

937
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:11,620
I think to tell me to do discover mode is

938
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,900
connected it is connected to it let's

939
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,760
launch another let's open another

940
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,070
console again let's have

941
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,309
this so much space we make you red and

942
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:24,590
always wiimote and the command and therapies

943
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,080
whose death l  eo pia is the name by which it is

944
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,580
usually called letters operation there is

945
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,799
really the remote control no and if

946
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,610
I do them purposes that with their own relics

947
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,850
vel

948
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,210
ok

949
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,309
in theory it should give some potatoes

950
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:47,289
wait no see let's do it again

951
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:49,250
this time is once  it does not go in fact

952
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,880
there was risk but translated to do that

953
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,809
then synchronized

954
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,790
bad stuff guys but this we

955
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,010
stop for a moment this we do

956
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:08,820
again that then wiimote discovery mode the

957
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:15,390
mouth come on so maybe you save me

958
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,490
sorry guys I have to close before it

959
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,050
worked saw it  even a guy

960
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,850
on the two titles had the other one

961
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,840
and went anyway practically

962
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,830
obviously connects via bluetooth and

963
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,800
then presses it is possible precisely with

964
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,740
joypad to move the robot legend the

965
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,760
same practically on the types of

966
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,870
information there are also

967
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,480
applications for mobile phones for android

968
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,490
one  it's called the leo pilot you find that it

969
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,840
also generates the same kind of

970
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,760
message same topic so it's

971
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,140
practically possible  go

972
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,470
check robben this stuff here real

973
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,060
virtual this case but also real

974
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,570
so baby i say hello again

975
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,820
but if you want to come and find it

976
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,320
bags find someone else who works

977
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,180
with rosco in the area we always have with

978
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,830
the robotic arm that also a rover the

979
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,780
turtle bot  that we do training on

980
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,980
these issues we have done information several times

981
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,040
in our turn last night

982
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,129
rosa industrial in frankfurt and

983
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:10,379
stuttgart sorry is also pursued

984
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,330
come up halfway play try come

985
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,830
in short that's how you see ok thanks for everything see you

986
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,580
next time
