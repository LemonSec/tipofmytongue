1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
ok then i'm one already here and i did

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,120
a talk about this binary watch in

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,410
2015 and i had arrived just ahead of

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,389
that version the what you see on the

5
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,690
left is the first one i

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,010
built i built it with a higher volley

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,350
a simple project  so in place from

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,150
the desire to do something with a

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,600
picc

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,570
I had taught how to program them so

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,580
I thought about what I can build with an

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,890
integrated that we make a small

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,660
binary bach clock but instead of

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,189
doing it from the table let's do it from the wrist

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,030
so this here was very simple

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,440
its leds and  let's try this it was

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,149
programmed in assemblies with two

18
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,270
buttons to turn on the and instead

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,370
what you see on the right and after 10

20
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,230
thousand versions the almost

21
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,600
commercial version after I will also explain the

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,860
various steps that I have taken that there is some

23
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,480
trying to industrialize a little  this

24
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,820
product and now they are let's say to the

25
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,850
first phase of beta

26
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,620
okay I guess everyone here knows

27
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,480
how the generous binary but anyway it is

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,530
if someone does not  simply knew it

29
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,030
or the leds that can be turned off

30
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,909
turned off 10 leds lit a 1

31
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,670
so above I can read the hours under

32
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,180
the minutes the positioning and big endian

33
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,890
then to the right or the least

34
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,869
significant

35
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,100
the numbers I have also written them

36
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,509
in the clock so a  starting from the

37
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,820
right 12 48

38
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,979
if, for example, I have to mark two o'clock, it will

39
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,770
only have led 2 on if the clock

40
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,439
must mark three o'clock I will have 2 and 1

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,479
so adding those on I can

42
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,490
keep the time therefore 2 plus 1 3 the

43
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,490
same speech for the minutes  so it is a

44
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,170
bit slow to read at the beginning but after

45
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,810
you learn how to make associations very quickly

46
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,280
and it becomes very fast but

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,180
as I told you before

48
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,770
this is what I started from

49
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,049
now six years ago it is a project to which I

50
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,479
work on time  lost so for

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,579
that six years have passed

52
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,200
ok this was based on

53
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,450
microsoft peak microcontroller the one most used by

54
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:00,890
everyone

55
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:07,430
what do you have 18f 6 18

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,910
16 f 86 this someone after 62 86 28 yes

57
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,250
the modern version and  the outcome that I

58
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,019
do not remember

59
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:20,060
is fine what was more there was an

60
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,620
external quarter the usual one from four

61
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,379
mega earths and two buttons

62
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:25,280
oh well this had various

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,980
problems in the sense of counting the

64
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,200
seconds and did it using the

65
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,599
external port  which is definitely not one of

66
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,890
the very precise ones and therefore I lost

67
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,260
several seconds a day more needle than the

68
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,970
other problems consumed a lot so

69
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,230
this is powered by two mini stylus

70
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,019
however even with it they were

71
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,480
off it consumed a lot there was the

72
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,799
possibility to activate  a

73
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:51,920
sleep mode so the clock consumed less

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,349
but still consumed a lot

75
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:55,730
I made a second version a little

76
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,349
smaller because with the other it was really

77
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,989
a patch always using the same

78
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:04,220
integrated version that smaller pp

79
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,680
with smd mounts which is mounted on the back

80
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,599
nothing has changed of this card and the rest

81
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,730
they always have hours minutes and two

82
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,819
buttons

83
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,680
after this so far I have always done

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,510
everything I did I did the sc  hede

85
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,950
then I got tired of making the

86
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,010
cards I tried various internet sites to

87
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,299
get the cards made

88
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:24,350
so this card as I

89
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:29,620
did I assembled the components with a soldering iron

90
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,370
is fine I assembled the various components race

91
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,380
of actor the case is a pvc house  what a

92
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,630
cutter you me and c was mounted a little button

93
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,549
if you see this here was a

94
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:42,500
side button that always got stuck so

95
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,810
this is one of the problems of this is

96
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,639
very nice in the sense that in the market they

97
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,980
exist their binary logic but no one

98
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,720
makes them with electronics so much in sight

99
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,579
in the sense I am generally a

100
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,620
normal watch with LEDs inside

101
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,660
instead I have always tried to make

102
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,980
the card more visible as

103
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,319
possible never to hide any part

104
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,150
of the electronics this was very nice

105
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,299
you could touch the components but then

106
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:06,919
if one touched with a finger  this quarter

107
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,690
that the clockwork court to keep

108
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,400
the time stopped at the count then

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,739
wasted seconds slamming it on the table

110
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:13,990
the compositions started  nti

111
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:20,060
therefore had its problems how to

112
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,520
avoid these problems then to

113
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,380
try not to blow up the components

114
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,350
I tried all the paints possible

115
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,730
I bought I don't know how much and cans

116
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,460
of primer paint of everything but to have

117
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,440
a paint stick to the cover

118
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,360
of the pcb is very difficult because  the

119
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,680
paint has made room for charm from the

120
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,320
tin also the paints that said on

121
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,870
tend to crack

122
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,460
the solution I found is

123
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,100
pouring an epoxy resin

124
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,120
so even when we are operating the

125
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,420
resins I did some experiments

126
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,470
at the beginning of these here  I made about

127
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,300
twenty but these also had their

128
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,280
problems and this was the point where it

129
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,740
had arrived in 2015 the

130
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,630
possible resin very beautiful very shiny

131
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,460
protects me the components no more problems

132
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,160
that if it touches a part of the clock it no

133
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,200
longer works fourth though  sic is scratched

134
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,210
very easily

135
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,430
and then I've always had problems with a

136
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,870
problem called carbonation

137
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,510
there is the queen of  it was shiny as soon as it was made

138
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,950
but after a month we start to become

139
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,770
opaque and I tried other types of resins

140
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,790
but I was unable to solve this

141
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,880
problem so in spite of myself in the end

142
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,040
I had to put a glass in it is something

143
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,450
that at the beginning I did not want precisely so as not to

144
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,610
try  not to encapsulate the card and

145
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,170
hide it in some way with a

146
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,760
case but it is the only solution to

147
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,100
build something resistant to here

148
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,750
I added a bit of fitch to respect

149
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,250
this version here also this had

150
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,200
its own text and the key also had

151
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,240
problems  as long as it was easy for it to

152
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,100
fit in more it would have been

153
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,480
interesting to make it

154
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,590
water resistant so I decided not to

155
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,480
put any more buttons

156
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,180
in it in fact these two round pitches you

157
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,130
see are really two touch buttons and

158
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,320
here I changed the brand of the integrated and

159
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,440
a texas instrument  so then very

160
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,450
interesting because it is integrated on the

161
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,640
market which gives me the possibility of

162
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,920
having capacitive keys in sleep mode at

163
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,320
the lowest possible consumption  the so also

164
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,140
in this configuration here with the

165
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,240
touch keys and which are scanned 10 times

166
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,990
per second

167
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,910
the battery life and more than two

168
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,960
years which in any case for a bad touch key

169
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,660
then I added and an

170
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,009
aluminum case the house and I always

171
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:28,960
did  always made in pvc

172
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,270
but let's say to do something a little more

173
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,349
commercial

174
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:33,490
I tried to make an

175
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,530
aluminum case at the beginning I did them after

176
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,270
I will show you some pictures of how

177
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,349
I worked them

178
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:40,780
but these here now I have them done and

179
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,130
therefore it is  it was the adventure

180
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,340
of industrialization I mounted a

181
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,599
sapphire crystal

182
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:47,620
now I don't know then it is very

183
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,880
interesting I don't know if you have ever

184
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,590
seen the difference between a normal glass

185
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,199
when it speaks not of sapphire

186
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,310
glass interesting because sapphire crystal is not

187
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,070
real glass and oxide  aluminum and

188
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,780
what we say they mount on

189
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,310
high-end watches

190
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,470
because on the hardness mons if the glass is

191
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,360
6 on a scale from 1 to 10 where ten

192
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,789
diamond sapphire crystal and 9 therefore it is

193
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:08,259
much more difficult to scratch but

194
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,460
really difficult I did some

195
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,650
tests at home and only those, however,

196
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,539
the nvidia drill bits can be

197
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,300
traced tried with screwdrivers scissors

198
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,460
other things you can not score and

199
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,370
okay that from this resists water

200
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,720
the battery is easy to replace there

201
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,150
are four screws on the bottom and I have

202
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,470
deliberately left

203
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,169
programming exposed then by removing

204
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:33,880
the cover on the back and removing the

205
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,360
battery

206
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,969
one can reprogram it and software

207
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:38,349
I have not loaded it yet because written a

208
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:41,020
bit crap but when will I ever have the  time

209
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,789
to write decently local but

210
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,479
at the beginning of the project

211
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,820
this here is the project let's say a circuit

212
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,169
diagram of the clock as

213
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,789
you can see it is very simple it has nothing

214
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:54,969
special it was a bit difficult to

215
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:57,430
design the shape and layout

216
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,690
of the capacitive keys master each led  and

217
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,460
multiplied by minutes and hours

218
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,139
the pidini of the integrated are directly connected there is

219
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:07,900
a common resistance

220
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,270
nie  nte there is the fourth from ruggeri has a very

221
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,509
precise external with two

222
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:18,270
high precision capacitors and nothing more

223
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,160
for this we say the pcb as

224
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,200
designed those you see red are

225
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,370
the two capacitive keys this blue is

226
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,930
an external ring that would be a third

227
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,600
capacitive key  because precisely of

228
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,830
capacitive reds and that it is a watch that

229
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,570
holds water with capacitive keys for

230
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,669
example the mib end is such a thing

231
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,020
I go in the shower and it turns on

232
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,729
continuously because the drops of water are

233
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,800
felt as a touch  to try to

234
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,620
avoid this problem it is possible to

235
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,820
use a foreign ring tried to

236
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,250
design an external ring and use it as

237
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,950
capacitive text so if I

238
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,910
press one of these two with a finger it

239
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,770
will not be sensitive enough external ring

240
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,930
to feel a touch but if there is  a lot of

241
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,020
water on top of the glass or he puts a

242
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,190
palm of his hand on it

243
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,570
I will also feel the third fret and this

244
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,490
I can use to cut the other two

245
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,710
so when I feel a pressure on the

246
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,910
ring and  sternum off the

247
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,969
power on function

248
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,570
ok these boards do not have the

249
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,910
site done and the crocs if you need to do

250
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,610
pcb I highly recommend it they have

251
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,070
very good prices and I found them very

252
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,720
professional once they were

253
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,090
wrong to get me one of the boards as soon as they got them

254
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,920
'I said they checked if

255
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,630
they noticed it thousand sent for free the

256
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,250
next day

257
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,720
so all very well I get

258
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,710
these cards in groups of five and then

259
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,970
I balance them then my

260
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,830
very professional assembly equipment

261
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,770
consists of this bottom oven guerre

262
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,760
flor de longhi lo  I wanted I wanted it with

263
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,710
the fan me but they also cheated me

264
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,210
on this so it is not even

265
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,670
ventilated anyway I did some

266
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,970
tests at various heights so 77 minutes at 150

267
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,510
degrees cooked perfect

268
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,790
I always tend to put at the center then

269
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,600
always in my great

270
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,610
professionalism uses  a beautiful

271
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,740
pokémon downing card to roll out the

272
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,440
solder paste so if you know the

273
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,060
process to solder the cards  and but

274
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,970
let's say that these cards here put some

275
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,459
on the card I put this stencil

276
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:34,129
that has small holes in correspondence

277
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:37,879
with the pitches after the stand or the

278
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,889
syringes of solder paste that a paste

279
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,660
that has a cluj ante of

280
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,949
tin spheres is placed here with this

281
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:47,749
Latin paper as if it were a

282
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:50,420
screen printing I remove the stencil and I find myself

283
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,279
a card where in the pitches there is

284
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,499
this tin paste then a lot of the

285
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:57,230
components 1 to 1 with tweezers and put

286
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,410
in the oven

287
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:04,009
the house was designed in fusion which

288
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:06,499
costs another  program that I recommend

289
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,300
here too there is nothing special

290
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,689
except that I have not struggled to

291
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:13,939
understand how to design a

292
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,709
watch house in the sense of the tolerances the

293
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,230
glass of one meter inside interlocking how much

294
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,369
tolerance should I put in the interlocking

295
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:22,639
who makes me  the gasket how much the gasket must

296
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,839
be spent on all

297
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,240
information that is not found

298
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,439
I could not find I have

299
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:30,619
searched all possible forums in the

300
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:31,970
end but I know  I was able to contact me for a

301
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,339
lifetime in switzerland who made me

302
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:36,230
these gaskets and they also came out to

303
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,699
give me the tolerances that were

304
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,559
necessary so below I was able to

305
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,670
write these tolerances to my

306
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,689
speaker suppliers

307
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:46,339
this is a render that I made when

308
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,649
I will do a  site if anything I will put these

309
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:52,009
renderings then the crates at the beginning

310
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:53,899
I made them is interesting because if you

311
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,129
want to keep the water has a crate by

312
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:56,779
putting an interlocking meter you cannot

313
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:00,110
embellish it because the milling of the let's say

314
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,549
of the quarry where the glass will fit together

315
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:03,980
you will have  grooves of the cutter then

316
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,509
this must be turned or used an

317
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:07,549
analyzer a trainer of that

318
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:09,230
diameter I did not have it therefore or

319
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,949
starting from a full one first I turn it back

320
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:14,809
then I made this small one but where

321
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:20,329
I put the hollowed case the recess for

322
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:23,119
the glass I fix it  and then taken the rest

323
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:25,579
in such a way precisely because returning

324
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,569
inside all the grooves will be

325
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:31,399
helical and not vertical and the water does not

326
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,819
pass in this m  anera

327
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,799
and this is always the case with the

328
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,540
gasket the house 2 gaskets one

329
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,189
gasket above the glass had to fit together

330
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:40,660


331
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,089
and a gasket behind it had to be inhabited

332
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:45,879
with 4 screws the bottom

333
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:48,100
here these are the components of the

334
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,230
case precisely this the glass this

335
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,579
that is the gasket that  I got

336
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:54,730
made in switzerland and from this is the

337
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,649
aluminum case made in china I

338
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,629
bought

339
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:00,819
myself then this here is a bottom in

340
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:03,490
316l stainless steel that I have laser cut

341
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,850


342
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:08,560
ok in industrialization there is

343
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,310
one when one

344
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,529
ok I make one  defended I do the

345
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,600
checkout it takes me two days to make an

346
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,250
ok I see that everything works

347
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,899
I would like to do a few more and

348
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,939
faster the easiest way to

349
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:21,819
go to china in the sense that I tried

350
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:23,620
to ask for a quote from companies

351
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,720
near me but for a few pieces  if you

352
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,089
go and ask for 10 pieces, they ask for figures that are

353
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:31,569
really impossible,

354
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:33,579
so either you make huge productions

355
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,250
or you can't, on the other hand, many

356
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,079
suppliers in china make very high prices

357
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,189
good even for very small quantities

358
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,829
then this here is the site

359
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:46,089
I turned to I don't know if you know

360
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:47,860
the expresses the exes for baba's evening they

361
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,569
are let's say the expresses and the

362
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:52,540
ebook version like a libè in china arrived

363
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,100
instead puts me in contact with  the

364
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,120
suppliers

365
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,959
then I also put this beautiful

366
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,060
photo of look how happy the boss

367
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:04,630
of alibaba jack is but ok then as a

368
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,610
functional baba you go to this site

369
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,399
and ask for estimates of

370
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,589
generally random that is looking for

371
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,740
companies that do turning I take 10

372
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,110
and  who asks for a quote to the

373
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,040
estimates generally respond

374
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,680
you have to read them and those who give the

375
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,300
lowest prices probably have

376
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,980
not even opened your project because

377
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,420
I have had estimates for the coffers

378
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,000
of one dollar each which is really an

379
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,800
impossible figure so  surely

380
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,829
the libum ones I don't know are

381
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:38,290
definitely to be discarded on the sites other

382
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,259
crazy quotes of high prices halfway there

383
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:43,420
was here  Someone to whom I later asked other

384
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,399
questions

385
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,930
by doing this asking for estimates and

386
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,279
then verifying estimates as well

387
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,050
as how they went I met these three

388
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,819
people

389
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:55,339
then the first and mister john o'shea that

390
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:57,199
this guy is fine I

391
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,550
exchanged some emails then one day

392
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,720
I was eating make me a

393
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,339
video call on remaining video calls

394
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:03,139
with him for two hours and I remember the story

395
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,899
of his life of his children

396
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:07,249
however it was interesting because it is

397
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:09,829
true he really has this face so he

398
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:11,209
really exists

399
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:12,740
this is what is called the names of the

400
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,930
man in the sense of him  he is not he does not work for

401
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,509
a factory he acts as an intermediary between me

402
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:19,970
and china he is a figure that they usually

403
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,430
say to avoid because he

404
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,329
obviously wants his earnings but aware

405
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:29,360
of my little knowledge of the environment

406
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,009
I said maybe if I am addressing a

407
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:33,980
person who  he acts as an intermediary for me, at least he knows

408
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,800
which companies to talk to, in fact, it

409
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,449
was an advantage because the first time

410
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:39,829
and coordinated the mila coffers did a

411
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:41,839
lot of harm and  even before they

412
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,819
came to me the raids came to him

413
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,860
and so I didn't have to pay

414
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,139
anything he made me do it if

415
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:49,610
I hadn't had a mii del mela me they

416
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,050
would have come home and after

417
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,490
I guess it would have been much more

418
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,709
mess  send it back and maybe to

419
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:55,819
change maybe they would

420
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:59,059
n't even have done it probably this is

421
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,970
another guy mister andy one they write me

422
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,410
the two days because the one you buy

423
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,850
glass from really every two days

424
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,379
asks me if they want more every two

425
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:07,839
days

426
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,300
good and this is  my favorite

427
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,149
mister sunshine shao to a photo that

428
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:15,769
I highly doubt it is of a

429
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:17,569
dinner working in a factory is also a

430
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:21,740
very name I don't know surely it's not

431
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,559
his identity but he sent things to me

432
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,750
according to the specifications

433
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:32,000
ok from these of mine  small experiences I

434
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,199
learned about the 2 oct

435
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,449
very fundamental for the re baba that is

436
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:37,009
you must never do that if you want you

437
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:38,660
need to do something with a

438
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,040
specific choice particular you ask  sect a

439
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,679
producer is wrong that is if I

440
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:43,970
need to do something intolerance a

441
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,800
penny I ask the producer you know how to do it at the

442
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,689
penny he answers yes but if he

443
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:48,980
asks him how you can do it to the thousandths

444
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,589
banks yes the same you do it to the micro

445
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,319
he conceals you know how to do it  to 0 a micro yes

446
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:56,149
anything you ask

447
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,279
specifically they answer yes so you

448
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,870
don't have to ask so

449
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,730
ask what tolerance you can make

450
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,470
me then asking so

451
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,510
generally they are honest

452
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,949
otherwise any other request they

453
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:09,079
always say yes and then they don't know I think they

454
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,569
think they can get away with it  somehow

455
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,520
however one thing really to keep in

456
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,030
mind and then you have to really give

457
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,459
very tight specs that is if I

458
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:20,839
when I go to a manufacturer or and I

459
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,930
need to get myself a car and in each

460
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,540
specific I want the type of tires

461
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,800
that I usually want manufacturers  he

462
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,750
asks me but what kind of tires do you want instead

463
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,220
the Chinese do not ask for a car

464
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,690
without specifying the type of rubber and he

465
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,880
puts it  and 1 out of any specific random type

466
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,040
that you do not really write

467
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,130
they do it at random if you write it

468
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,040
they do it if not really there is for them the

469
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,300
fact that they want you told them it

470
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,740
means that they were free to do

471
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,640
what they wanted

472
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,980
this  a problem also because in my

473
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,660
glass order I had an

474
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,160
anti-reflective treatment for blue

475
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,840
and I told him leave others like the

476
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,540
samples and it is at all transparent

477
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,340
peter but I asked to do it like the

478
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,770
samples is yes but we don't know I don't

479
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,630
we remembered what you did in the samples

480
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,970
but they don't ask me it is random what

481
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,570
they ask you

482
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,220
I don't have this information apple you can

483
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,160
give no at random this is really

484
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,920
interesting to know and / or other interesting things

485
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,120


486
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,289
yes generally then another thing if

487
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:21,909
you have to do  with baba soils and it is better to

488
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:24,009
ask for a quote for a

489
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,779
large number of pieces like you can give me a

490
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:28,269
quote for a thousand pieces and then

491
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:31,240
ask him ok I can make a

492
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,009
test order of 5 pieces for  because if you ask them for

493
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:34,990
five pieces, they turn up their noses

494
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,090
immediately and then most of them

495
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,019
answer you it's another thing the

496
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,029
details for example I bought some

497
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,950
straps I sent them a photo of that

498
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,720
time they send me a photo they

499
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,490
don't have a catalog in china  no catalogs are used

500
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,559
a company that makes straps that

501
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,169
you have a catalog of these citrines no it

502
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:55,750
's okay they send me a photo of a series

503
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,980
of straps that made like the

504
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,409
girl I wrote there on the table I tell them ok

505
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:02,740
I want this they send them to me and not  I'm

506
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,110
that the sofa a photo and I say

507
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,120
look it's not this

508
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,620
and he say yes but look at the buckle

509
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,809
and the same I say yes but the texture is

510
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:13,690
different and he answers ah yes I checked

511
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,190
very well and actually the

512
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,860
different texture if they a  they will be expected two give

513
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,840
us a piece of black plastic a

514
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,179
piece of black and black aluminum are two

515
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:23,440
black pieces

516
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,659
this is because precisely if I speak then

517
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:27,279
commercial who speaks English but

518
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,019
commercials speak with Chinese in the factory

519
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:30,850
c  he does not speak english so

520
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,830
what i say is understood metall pretended

521
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,559
a mess so super specific in the

522
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,090
specs i put them a picture of the

523
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,679
plot i tell them i want this plot

524
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,100
then they do it right but you have to

525
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,639
know

526
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,080
then about these watches here the first

527
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,840
we say pieces  in beta these are really

528
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,429
the ones that I brought here

529
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:53,440
so I still have to open a site

530
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,009
I still have to do anything I was

531
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,840
expecting to have the first ones that

532
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,919
are these

533
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,140
so if you are interested you can

534
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,440
have these first pieces in beta I have

535
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,350
five of which one for each type later  I do not know if

536
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,270
you have been there anyway I do them

537
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:24,399
already disappeared long in fact they exist in

538
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:26,049
several versions, let's say the case the face

539
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:28,960
or black or aluminum color and the tracks

540
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,149
I make them or silver that are let's say

541
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:34,029
those spain you or I have them

542
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:36,549
left uncovered in copper or that

543
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:39,639
casino get the slopes made a card

544
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,369
with the slopes uncovered a disaster

545
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:44,230
order three times before they realized they

546
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,230
had to do the sc  operte and then also

547
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,690
with the golden tracks I these versions

548
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,409
let's say future developments

549
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,419
I wanted to do something like kickstarter

550
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:01,119
or first this little beta series that I

551
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,580
got myself done we tell you the one

552
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,139
just to test if there are

553
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,929
particular flaws if I discover that after a month they

554
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:12,070
all explode  but if we say the first

555
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,259
I think around are pretty good

556
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:18,690
I think I'll think something like kickstarter

557
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,519
I'm doing by collecting a mailing

558
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,679
list for people who somehow

559
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,600
want to be wanting to stay informed about

560
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,759
this project so if you tell me I will

561
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:30,009
add you and when there is some news  I have been

562
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:31,419
saying this for a year and I still have to send

563
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:34,989
an email but when I send them I will send them

564
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:39,389
to all those who are interested

565
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:44,350
maybe I was very fast if there are

566
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,970
any questions some particular questions

567
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,690


568
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:55,220
you are talking about add a

569
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,809
time control from the servers let's say radio

570
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:01,700
controlled possible  or it takes up

571
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,279
too much space and I have battery problems

572
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:07,669
then and there was a big battle

573
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:09,679
of me versus myself on putting

574
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,019
rechargeable battery or not eventually

575
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:14,360
won the non-rechargeable battery however

576
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,889
sacrificing everything that is not

577
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:18,249
essential so the moment

578
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,970
I could put a

579
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,679
rechargeable battery then I should make a way

580
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,059
to recharge the battery then it

581
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:24,499
should keep the  'water the way to

582
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:25,549
recharge the battery

583
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:27,110
or I should do induction charging but

584
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,119
therefore does not holster lights in common stainless steel

585
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,340
let's say that the limit of

586
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,990
the non-rechargeable bodywork is just

587
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,909
what I cannot afford to

588
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:37,159
consume energy for example to

589
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,610
synchronize via radio a limit,

590
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,909
however, let's say to the  in the end one changes them

591
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:46,039
every six months

592
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,249
yes let's say that here maybe now

593
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:51,399
not even more

594
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:53,899
and if maybe they want to remove the daylight

595
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:56,010
saving time or play which one the two

596
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,140
[Music]

597
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:07,129
here is so I don't even need to

598
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:08,659
ask for the manual to change them

599
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:10,549
why change the time  with two keys a

600
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:13,869
little complicated not so complicated little

601
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:18,019
if there is any other question is here

602
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:23,090
ahead  i since the chinese

603
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,629
often make mistakes bigger the money what you do

604
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:30,019
shops nearby i pay to pay the

605
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:32,269
same pay them nita how it works then the

606
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:34,669
problem is that for small lots then

607
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:38,929
you usually pay 30 on large orders

608
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:42,590
you pay 30 percent  immediately 70

609
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,539
percent when they send you photos

610
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:48,590
and you say ok or you pay

611
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,789
someone finally to take him check your

612
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:52,549
product he says ok the time when they send you you

613
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:54,169
pay the remaining 70

614
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:56,960
percent but when you make small orders like

615
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,530
these are at most a thousand

616
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,110
euros tel the cookies all immediately there is

617
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,700
no one gives you this service they tell you

618
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,550
give me the money immediately or just as

619
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,900
I did you pass through a mini

620
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,800
canteen you give the money to him and he for

621
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,120
example that time  who discarded

622
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,980
the crates for me, he arranged with the

623
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,230
supplier company to have them redone without

624
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,990
paying because in some way he is a

625
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,880
person who does his job to

626
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,930
his customers

627
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,170
so if his supplier of

628
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,060
turned defects maybe  he does not want to lose him as a

629
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,310
customer so you can remake him pieces even

630
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,740
for free for you as a person

631
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,210
if you make the pieces if you order for

632
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,180
a lot of money you agree but

633
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:41,370
for small orders you risk

634
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:46,360
inevitable and then taxation on

635
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,980
import beta in Italy we are quite

636
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,840
unlucky  there is now usually depends on the courier

637
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,730
that is type TNT that the one with which they

638
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,720
send more to the fixed 26 euro 26

639
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,430
euro of customs duties of customs duties

640
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,910
then the type of TNT that takes two

641
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,100
opaque sends you the email bla bla bla 26

642
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,200
euro  independent of quality, how much do

643
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,520
you spend

644
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,230
so if you make small orders and

645
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,960
the large orders are made a lot, no then the vabbè

646
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,320
the VAT and then on orders over 150 euros and

647
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,230
the duty and the customs duty so for

648
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,550
example I who have made orders from  one thousand

649
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,940
euros exceeds 150 euros the customs

650
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,520
duty based on the type of goods and in fact they

651
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,320
send me an email they ask me what kind of

652
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,990
goods and there is a rules board among which

653
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,930
there is like the thing meters from watchmaking and you

654
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,820
give them that code  there i  The glass of the

655
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,220
lottery is taxed at 5 percent so

656
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,220
they put you a 5 percent duty but for

657
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,500
example there are many now

658
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,750
there too then the Chinese don't

659
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,430
mind writing you a different price

660
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,960
than the actual one you have to stay there too

661
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,430
a little careful because then maybe they

662
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,510
send you something worth a thousand euros they

663
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,490
write that it costs 10 euros

664
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,900
here the customs say about a box so

665
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,310
it cannot cost 10 euros that they keep it

666
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,860
still for a month they open it there too

667
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,610
you have to be careful

668
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:09,980
yes some still are true  a few times

669
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,110
it happened to me that they asked me for a

670
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,690
payment confirmation so yes that then,

671
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,980
among other things, the payment confirmation and

672
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,390
a paypal screen

673
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,039
because I know the payment confirmation one

674
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,100
well, oh no but I

675
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,840
have no bank details  in that case there

676
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,100
because I make a payment via

677
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,410
common paypal actually I too

678
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,030
have asked myself these questions but as

679
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,160
confirmation he just needs a

680
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,240
screen but if I don't know why

681
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,890
then when yes  does bank transfer other

682
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,360
types of payment they want if the

683
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,490
details of their bank and everything is

684
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,730
true but in fact once he had a

685
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,880
problem that I paid 500 euros on

686
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,440
stage they had written that it cost him

687
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,780
300 and then I when I had to

688
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,580
confirm the competitions  of payment I owed the

689
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,210
500 one to the races because I

690
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,210
never had it

691
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:08,759
