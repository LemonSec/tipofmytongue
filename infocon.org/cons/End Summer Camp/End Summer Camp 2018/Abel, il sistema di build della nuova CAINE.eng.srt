1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
or to all I am andrea and this

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,480
talk is about apple which is a

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,259
bild system that we are introducing for the

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,020
development of kane and now I will also explain for

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,230
a moment what it is for

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,859
those who do not know that in a

7
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:28,640
linux distribution in the form of live  dvd or usb

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,740
that deals with computer forensics

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,980
so it is used, for example, to acquire

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,320
duplicate computers for later subjecting them

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,350
to analysis, surveys, appraisals and things of

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,320
this type and some

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,920
interesting features on which then

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,710
I am mainly involved in

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,110
software development and I am also very interested  of

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,890
computer forensics

17
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,090
therefore I try to combine these

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,070
two these two branches together in fact two years

19
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,049
ago I presented here aesc recuperates

20
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,049
bit which is a forensic reconstruction software

21
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,240
of damaged ntfs file systems

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,610
with relative algorithms

23
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,360
represented in a degree thesis

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,259
so if you are looking for algorithms  for

25
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,580
reconstructed fs

26
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,000
you can also see how it is done 14

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,150
that

28
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,830
the program that  it is used to do more

29
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,650
osint so it is used to

30
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,850
date web pages

31
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,520
the input dates a blog article

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,410
uses and the http header of the images

33
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,150
and static resources to determine

34
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,340
a range of time interval in which

35
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,170
the article was also written  if

36
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,880
maybe then someone from cms has changed

37
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,430
the date to be clever says no oh well

38
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,810
but the photos have been uploaded at

39
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,440
this time it is in fact I started to

40
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,600
collaborate with kane proposing to the

41
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,900
team of the leader project also in an

42
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,570
automated build system so

43
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,120
then  that in is a distribution that

44
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,670
was designed by a student in

45
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,110
2008

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,930
giancarlo giustini who then graduated the

47
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,250
one who presented a project

48
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:30,280
this this system after

49
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,400
practically immediately took over nanni bassetti

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,050
that a professional of forensic information technology

51
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,489
among the best known in  italia

52
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,900
who took the reins of the project and from

53
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,480
that moment started

54
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,030
developing it and then releasing

55
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,870
all versions  later of kane by

56
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,420
introducing new tools by

57
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,710
adding improvements

58
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,990
and so there is obviously also

59
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,090
keeping up with various versions of ubuntu

60
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,670
that in any case that in a sort

61
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,870
of ubuntu respin and last year

62
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,070
version 9 came out is now used

63
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,600
throughout the  world also because it is one of the

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,950
two Italian distributions of forensics

65
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,780
that are among the most used the waves

66
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,970
are both Italian so you

67
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,530
can even find on some

68
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,100
guidelines of the European level in which it is

69
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,440
written if you do not have an

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,720
example hardware riff logger to acquire  a hard

71
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,000
disk download that in linux the name is written

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,860
which is quite strange for a

73
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,060
guideline because it should be

74
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,950
generic but actually there are not

75
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,370
many tools that do this type of

76
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,620
thing so after several years it has

77
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,110
become a

78
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:55,050
fairly important investigative tool  it is

79
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,900
precisely the interesting thing that it is a

80
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,120
fairly complete collection that

81
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,650
counts

82
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,489
dozens of tulle and applications in the sense

83
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,769
I tool I mean maybe more tools in the

84
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,329
commands applications more with graphical

85
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,680
interface, however, always programs

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,290
are there both with and

87
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,918
without interface and are also well organized

88
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,389
so that a person who has never

89
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,870
used kane finds  also easily

90
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,310
what you are looking for because I am

91
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,340
less organized in addition to this

92
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,270
however it is not a simple ubuntu with two

93
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,190
more programs it is thrown there which can be

94
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,210
done in five minutes

95
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,280
but there are also some

96
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,020
interesting additions such as herbert

97
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,789
stub  amount air which are tools

98
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:45,150
made to let's say avoid the classic

99
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,940
automatic mount its usual a

100
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,650
stick usually on ubuntu the first

101
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,539
thing I would do to mount in reading and

102
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:52,260
writing

103
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,900
the device updates all the metadata

104
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,490
it wants on the file system among all the

105
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,810
changes that  wants and shows you the

106
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,400
window from which you file in instead

107
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,229
of inserting a usb key in

108
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:03,509
it doesn't happen ace  absolutely nothing and

109
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,370
you have to go and unlock the device

110
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,620
for writing with mountain

111
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,270
if you want to deal with the writing or

112
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,720
if you want to mount on the reading they are

113
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,580
blocked both at the device level and at the

114
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,449
level of individual partitions and in

115
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:20,250
addition then there are also patches

116
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,760
that have been  insert to avoid

117
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,400
accidental mounting even in

118
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,430
the boot process because I do not know if you

119
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,960
have this but when a

120
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,780
distribution such as ubuntu but

121
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,479
many others do so when it

122
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,349
boots from dvd or from the key what it

123
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,840
does is search on all devices  which finds

124
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,159
the root file system

125
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:47,039
until it detects and to do so

126
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,229
generally also mounts the partitions and

127
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,360
mounting for example an ex t4 partition

128
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
and starts the automatic l day

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,490
and then makes a lot of changes to the

130
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,530
hard disk things that you cannot do

131
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,510
if  you are doing

132
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,280
a cloning of a hard drive and must

133
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,320
go to court

134
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,840
because you have practically changed

135
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,480
element d  the test

136
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,980
ok now I talked about all the

137
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,540
positive aspects

138
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,550
the problem is that there were some points

139
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,840
to improve for example

140
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,840
so far the distro has been made let's say by

141
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:28,580
hand and consists of a boat for those who

142
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,180
do not know it system which is a

143
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,040
program that  it is installed in ubuntu

144
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,400
and until a few versions ago because

145
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,860
now it is no longer developed so

146
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,170
on the latest versions it does not work and

147
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,420
therefore one can install a

148
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,150
virtual machine with ubuntu install

149
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,460
the system which then makes all the

150
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,560
changes you want you add

151
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,260
programs  of the packages or not of the files

152
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,440
on the desktop other with the wallpaper

153
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,960
change change the menus after opening this

154
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,760
program with a graphical interface

155
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,740
selection of the changes that you want to

156
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,670
save

157
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,810
for example if you want to save the

158
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,380
user's files or not etc. and this

159
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,750
program packs everything and generates

160
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,820
uniso the  iso practically becomes the

161
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,500
official release of kane when

162
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,910
you need to make a new version you also have to

163
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,500
install  in the previous on

164
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,210
another virtual machine revised the

165
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,170
resistance is to make the changes again

166
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,770
and to package then it is

167
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,470
all done by hand of

168
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,570
course it is a nasty approach

169
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,320
because

170
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,270
and all manual means that you can

171
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,520
make mistakes because of course

172
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,810
people tend to  make mistakes and / or

173
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,610
forget some details maybe

174
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,280
or as it happened on one of the

175
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,380
latest versions there was recover bit in the

176
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,380
menu it appeared in three different points and

177
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,560
on the two launchers it started correctly

178
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,180
on one it did not start because it had been

179
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,440
inserted by mistake several times and because of

180
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,350
course it can  happen and then it becomes

181
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,550
difficult to keep track of the changes

182
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,440
because if you ask me but what is the

183
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,380
changelog of kane or what is the

184
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,390
change log of kane mar

185
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,169
silvio talks about the exact google drive

186
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,410
these are files that are not

187
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,730
published anyway they are let's say

188
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,640
to the  internal of who takes care of kane and

189
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,159
are of the files in which it is written

190
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,179
added this pat  tto update

191
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,030
this other package or copy and

192
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,590
paste an email of a type that

193
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,909
suggests me to put these two books

194
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,860
of aa that there are no colorless proofs

195
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,740
mail

196
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,680
this of course does not need that

197
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,940
waste but it is not

198
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,920
scalable not at all and above all it is

199
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,990
really difficult  say between one

200
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,730
version of that the other thing has

201
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,790
changed in general and since the beginning of the

202
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,380
first version ever what are and

203
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,760
what are all the programs that are

204
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,230
included in china nobody knows

205
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,130
exactly one hundred percent

206
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,100
all maybe I'll tell you 99  percent but

207
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,270
something escapes me because it was

208
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,190
inserted in the first release in a

209
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,440
hidden directory and then there is a

210
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,930
forget that maybe the program

211
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,210
is already there then well you can't

212
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,170
substantially on the development stars

213
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,110
you find a person who is forced to

214
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,790
do  take over all the work

215
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,380
because it's not like you can tell one to

216
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,329
install you too system as long as I

217
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,920
add some programs you meanwhile make the

218
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,060
change on an interface  make graphics

219
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,630
because then like the funds with the stuff there

220
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,970
you can't do it and therefore you have to have

221
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,230
a person who does everything you cannot

222
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,130
accept also the

223
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,410
improvement contributions from other people

224
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,540
the improvement contributions are e-mails

225
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,660
that come to you with the bug reports that of

226
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,220
course that  You get the email

227
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,269
I wrote look that there is this

228
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,240
problem here if I change the keyboard

229
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,440
from English to wise italy ok I sign it

230
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,890
maybe I will solve it but this is very

231
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,690
inconvenient very uncomfortable so the idea

232
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,550
was ok

233
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,910
let's think of another system  and then

234
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,870
I got an idea and I said oh well

235
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,459
I should have the solution

236
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:34,319
let's try to do something better

237
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:37,500
the idea was basically to

238
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,680
automate and make

239
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,510
everything traceable that is from the beginning that is

240
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,920
starting from ubuntu maybe ubuntu matt

241
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,300
since  use mccann

242
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,610
we start from ubuntu mind

243
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,420
official release we find a system that is that you

244
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,250
apply all the changes and these

245
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,980
changes are traceable are

246
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,399
repeatable alt  re people want to

247
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,779
see that we have not been done

248
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:07,180
strange things that is that we have not told

249
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,320
anyone and in the end we may

250
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,600
also be able to say this program

251
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,079
the omitted are yes what has changed from

252
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:19,630
version 10 to version 11

253
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,630
these have changed  things and if there are

254
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,040
bugs and of course then maybe you can

255
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,930
open a

256
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,600
tav or something else and have the people

257
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,339
who use the strikes to insert mag

258
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:34,020
here is the inspiration I came from a

259
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,640
word really a bad word

260
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,630
practically so I say it for the benefit

261
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,279
of the video maybe they bieber me

262
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,810
so I'm going to say it and also to write if

263
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,100
there are children they can go out for a

264
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:51,300
moment the voice 6 excuse me I had to

265
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,830
say it I know it's a very bad word

266
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,089
especially for those who share the

267
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:59,839
developer but practically the box

268
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,130
if you go and see the

269
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,980
true meaning of the term it is yes how to pay

270
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,740
the systems engineers also costs money we already have the

271
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,910
developers who have a lot of stuff

272
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,080
to do so they a  we also work

273
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,450
the systems engineers without paying them more and

274
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,170
hysteria we send away the second

275
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,570
meaning in the dictionary the

276
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,240
small one is to automate the operations of the

277
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,910
prologue argument and that is the

278
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,680
excuse they actually use is precisely

279
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,470
no speech of this type but c  'it is

280
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,480
a fund of that actually

281
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,940
interesting in those practices of

282
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,180
that brutal word that if I

283
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,400
automate processes

284
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,360
I can also tell what I have

285
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,029
actually done what I have not done and I

286
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:47,690
am able to repeat them consistently

287
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,290
without surprises then I have spoken to you

288
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,930
so far  by kane I anticipated that

289
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,910
there is also another

290
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,440
linux distribution that does a similar thing is always

291
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,540
Italian which is deft so I was

292
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,850
on the right team and I proposed

293
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,110
this idea to him I told him look let's make

294
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,680
an automated system you find

295
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,100
everything  completely accurate track and you can

296
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,110
generate the distribution starting from

297
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,280
ubuntu you are sure that it comes out

298
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,400
clean and if there are any pr  Problems

299
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,690
update the system and fix

300
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,550
and bla bla and then all traced all

301
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,940


302
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,370
nice I told them is the answer of the person

303
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,340
who took care of them too of

304
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,780
course they usually do in the street

305
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,280
the virtual machine puts all the

306
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,410
programs and files able from the end and

307
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,870
so they took a new person who

308
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,160
has recently joined the team he said

309
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,590
now you do it

310
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,120
and I told this person you will be more

311
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,310
torn up the answer was yes it's

312
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,070
nice but I don't know because we have

313
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,560
always done so

314
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,480
yes but you always have the  problem that one

315
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,250
does everything in the specific case it is you who

316
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,110
find doing everything because the others in the

317
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,790
team cannot intervene on yours

318
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,570
on your virtual machine with buoys and

319
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,730
I hear the others because

320
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,920
I can tell you why I am the latest

321
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,540
since that point I thought

322
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,100
but I speak Arabic how can you not see that

323
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,730
this system here is not scalable or

324
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,699
maybe you see it but you say oh well let's

325
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:24,110
keep it so no then I said ok

326
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,720
perfect let's mark the cain team and the

327
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,709
answer from yes we like it then in May

328
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:36,589
I wrote in two hours the first

329
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:43,550
very minimal draft of apple and as a

330
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,920
development base or choices use vagrant because

331
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,829
vagrant is a system that allows me to

332
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:51,920
automate the generation of

333
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,600
virtual machines in this case we no longer have

334
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,190
virtual where that I make it

335
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,910
become less virtual machine in which inside

336
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,560
I run the whole

337
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,389
game generation system so if I want to

338
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:04,579
generate that in itself but instead of using

339
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:07,579
ubuntu as a class that is on a problem or

340
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:09,860
the same program I start from

341
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,300
great me  create a virtual machine with

342
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,339
a point 16 04

343
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:14,630
the virtual machine contains

344
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,480
inside the rest of the software that takes

345
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,850
the ubuntu iso works it and eventually

346
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,310
comes out and then we see how it comes

347
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,310
out that in itself in theory yes how the

348
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,690
big gino goes  even on windows I do not see

349
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,490
any problem to do it a procedure

350
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,779
that could easily run

351
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:34,970
on windows because in any case the

352
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,649
actual generation  happens

353
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:38,029
inside a virtual machine with

354
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:38,990
ubuntu

355
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,579
also because customizer that the tool that

356
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:45,380
is also automated in

357
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,540
all respects is a tool that

358
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,959
runs perfectly immediately 16 04

359
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,029
but sometimes some problems on

360
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:54,459
subsequent versions of ubuntu

361
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:57,110
so if I use point  18 as on this

362
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,690
laptop to be one hundred percent sure

363
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,490
that the picture is always

364
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,800
reproducible and there are no errors

365
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,510
even both day and so

366
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,190
on the package all on a

367
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,069
virtual machine that does the bild process and

368
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,660
at the same time to the advantage that

369
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,810
I do not  dirty the host system with the

370
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,360
customizer that places files around the

371
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,040
entire filesystem practically

372
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,140
configuration files advance the foot files

373
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,029
are rubber etcetera etcetera so

374
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:24,529
better to have a whole virtual machine

375
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:26,660
that if by chance something moves wrong I

376
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,790
delete it and recreate it  on the fly but

377
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,110
always because it goes to grant and in fact

378
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,980
automates everything for me now as the first thing

379
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,470
he said oh well I do the first demo  and

380
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,709
as a customization what I do I

381
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:40,939
do the update of all the countries

382
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:45,079
that are installed on the

383
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:47,449
normal ubuntu and in addition I add an

384
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:49,939
extra program just to say that the

385
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:52,939
system works and then the first demo

386
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:55,430
updated all the packages remember

387
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,689
this moment because it will come

388
00:16:56,689 --> 00:17:00,560
out later ok and it seemed to work

389
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,110
everything is the principle and functional the

390
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,089
structure let's say this is here we

391
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,760
have a

392
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,380
vagrant that is started let's say

393
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,480
with a large file vagrant file is a

394
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,319
configuration file that contains

395
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,939
the indication of the vases image that in

396
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,650
this case is ubuntu 16 04

397
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,179
so he downloads from his

398
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,030
repository and a boxing a

399
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,890
virtual machine already made with a point 16 04

400
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,809
which is already set to work on the

401
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:32,240
large and then contains the

402
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,919
provisioning instructions that install the other

403
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,909
programs we need

404
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:37,429
it is  customizer is a program

405
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:42,549
that would generate and the final iso files

406
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,159
after that when the virtual machine is

407
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:49,340
created you can connect in ssh

408
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,220
and start instead the real one which

409
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,040
includes a very simple binary file

410
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,220
that I explain to you and some basic files in the

411
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,260
meantime we need to put an iso which is

412
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,080
our starting iso is precisely ubuntu

413
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,500
mail

414
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,169
then we have the  storage file of

415
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,480
these meisels and

416
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,059
some scripts and in particular a

417
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:17,519
makefile in fact the command and in reality it

418
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,919
is simply a make crane that

419
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,419
prevents me from moving to the

420
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,460
right folder and giving the make command with

421
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,960
the right option

422
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,059
so if I write able  sending him

423
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,200
actually calls me make on that file

424
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,730
the first part is the extraction and

425
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,889
the extraction gives it

426
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:36,299
to us for free customizer so we simply invoke

427
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,149
this corn after there and look and look is the

428
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:42,440
most interesting part because the

429
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,350
all  'start we copy the scripps sign that

430
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,690
was inside our project we copy it

431
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,369
in the of mp of the ca kreuth of the

432
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:54,960
customizer practically customizer

433
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,269
unpacks the iso creates me 11 a carriage

434
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,919
that corresponds to the files  ystem of the iso

435
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,649
that will come out at the end is inside I

436
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:03,629
copy all the scripts folder there

437
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:05,399
after which I take the script folder

438
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:07,320
inside there are files that have a

439
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,289
name that prefixed there the digits

440
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:12,480
so they are in order and starts

441
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,369
running all the  scripts in order that

442
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:15,990
can be written instead written in

443
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,909
python or in theory also other types of

444
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:19,649
scripts but mainly these are

445
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:21,389
anything that is executable on

446
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:24,840
ubuntu so run all the scripts

447
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,570
if by chance one of the scripts gives an error

448
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,409
the process crashes and make  there is

449
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:33,629
also a way whereby it prints exactly

450
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:35,179
as it is doing

451
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:38,940
and in the end when it has run all uk

452
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,889
I know it has installed the

453
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,259
updated packages made the

454
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:45,360
graphic changes etc. etc.

455
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,990
then there is the time for the rebuild

456
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,360
the rebuild has to make some changes

457
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,749
on the  iso file for example an

458
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:56,519
interesting thing about ubuntu is that there is a

459
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,779
text file

460
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,779
inside the iso which contains the name of the

461
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:02,580
distribution if  instead of ubuntu mail he

462
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,999
writes that when I restart the

463
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:07,769
live without having changed anything

464
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:10,510
else the live starts

465
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,370
in the stand that it is the

466
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,020
username of the live that he set in

467
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,420
caen and also when it says try or

468
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,130
install  he tells me proof that he does not install

469
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,360
ken so practically that I

470
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,890
solved it by simply changing a

471
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,110
string because he reads it

472
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,090
dynamically so I have to make some

473
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,570
changes let's say branding of

474
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,410
graphics do the re bild and I generate

475
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,270
my final iso and in the end copies the  iso

476
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,640
in the host machine because so far

477
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,260
I have done everything in virtual love hi

478
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,320
take out the file because then I want to

479
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,250
publish it on the site that's all the

480
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,040
other two are more for testing

481
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,010
and development so practically

482
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,120
in one command only does everything

483
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,010
from start to finish he takes me injured and

484
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,780
makes all changes or pick ups

485
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,560
so I was quite happy let

486
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,460
's say satisfied result because I

487
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,450
saw that the procedime  nto worked

488
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,850
correctly about two hours of work I

489
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,740
said oh well it wasn't bad

490
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,360
obviously then we will have to implement

491
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,140
the actual changes and I

492
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,310
showed it to nanni bassetti who is the project

493
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,820


494
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,530
manager I also explained to him no because you know

495
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,210
we have an automated system and

496
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,800
appreciable etc. we are sure that

497
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,390
nothing changes because the

498
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,950
virtual machine always has the same version of

499
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,600
point the reaction was this

500
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,790
then touches you challenged enthusiasm because in

501
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,700
practice it is the concept was yes ok but you

502
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,140
have not yet generated that in you have

503
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,090
only done a beautiful thing

504
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:49,390
theoretically yes  ok right but in two

505
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,000
hours up here we arrived later with

506
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,160
some time it will be enough to add the

507
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,779
scripts

508
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:57,759
because now apple is

509
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,379
practically finished what you need to

510
00:21:59,379 --> 00:22:01,389
add are the scripts that

511
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:03,460
continue to make changes inside the

512
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,059
iso

513
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,440
some have already been put others

514
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,659
you still need to  finish them because it is a

515
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,419
work in progress

516
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,429
here until one day everything suddenly broke

517
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:16,029
down  mind I showed the

518
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:18,190
demo to another person days passed

519
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,570


520
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,279
the demo planted meta and the biel and

521
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,099
the use I will not go out anymore because because

522
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:26,619
ubuntu has released a kernel that used

523
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:28,539
a different compression from all flesh

524
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:30,570
to the previous one

525
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,559
now I do not  I always remember it was from

526
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,869
ics zip zip or vice versa and the customizer was

527
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:40,359
calibrated on all the ubuntu carnets that

528
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,799
had existed up to that moment they

529
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,749
had with the compression changing them

530
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:47,460
the system broke everything and then

531
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,629
because as you know every update

532
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:57,009
risks creating  problems and

533
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,690
in fact this in the end was the

534
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,669
moral of the story of this anecdote

535
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:07,179
that the trick is just starting the

536
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:08,799
customizations I immediately restore the

537
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,469
kernel on the iso exactly

538
00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:14,320
the version I say is stalled, then I block

539
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,539
with apt mark I block the

540
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:17,950
canon version so I don't  can you no longer upgrade

541
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,469
ever i do all

542
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:21,729
package upgrades when did

543
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:24,309
upgrade unlock call call mark

544
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:27,789
reverse and sic  as now installed the

545
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,529
kernel now the complete carnet this

546
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:30,879
case no longer complains and goes on

547
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:35,679
quietly and it is very important to

548
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,099
always use fixed versions of the

549
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:41,019
programs that especially those that

550
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,669
are not rests for so if I have made

551
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:44,499
the script it is not that I tell him  download

552
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:46,779
mida kitab the latest release you find of

553
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:49,929
auto xvi no download me the 4.8 point

554
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:54,009
zero point and it will always be the same so that

555
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:56,440
I do not try again with the other version and

556
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,049
I see that everything works then

557
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:00,000
I publish the script day

558
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and I am sure that if it does it  today

559
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,080
I can do it in a month it is always that

560
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,310
those in the repository are already less

561
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,780
problematic because in any case there is the

562
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,730
ubuntu team that tests the packages so they

563
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,870
have been a repository package

564
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,480
generally should not create

565
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,430
problems

566
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,690
it is not said in reality why the years

567
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,000
I realized that the latest version of

568
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,570
vagrant his point broke this

569
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,720
bild system but for this it is a bug

570
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,340
of the latest version of the variant in alt  or

571
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,770
enough to downgrade it to a main

572
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,960
release and it is immediately back in place so

573
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,130
probably when they fix it, however, here is

574
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,870
the problem of the versions you encounter

575
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,760
everywhere even if you develop

576
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,770
web applications in python or other things

577
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:47,070
you have the dependencies and if I update a

578
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,750
library and I had not done the test

579
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,980
maybe  everything breaks me so precisely

580
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,120
when you get the change in

581
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,710
life it is not that you are always ready

582
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,150
especially it is software and

583
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,250
versions the change throws a punch

584
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,010
in the face practically and blocks everything

585
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,180
so what seemed to work

586
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,400
perfectly

587
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,770
suddenly no longer works

588
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,760
ok  then in the last five minutes

589
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,470
I wanted to briefly explain what are the

590
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,600
customizations we are going to do

591
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,180
basically first of all okay

592
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,650
this is the simplest stuff we can

593
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,290
fit all the ubuntu packages we are

594
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,690
interested in and this is a line of apt so

595
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,050
far there is nothing  exciting but

596
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,580
then we can do even cuter things

597
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,460
as  load for example from external sources such

598
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,160
as kitab etc. other

599
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,010
program releases unpack will place

600
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,780
in a correct folder create the

601
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,030
launchers also because maybe you download

602
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,710
a program of the tabs it puts it in a

603
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,210
crazy folder but also to the icon on the

604
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,530
menu

605
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,630
and therefore the user  he will never know that

606
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,790
you put it in or pt if

607
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,070
the icon is not limited so we also put

608
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:58,440
the icon then we apply the patches

609
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,000
we mentioned before

610
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,100
now we will see if we can do them

611
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,900
all automatically because some things

612
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,520
maybe are  some changes that

613
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,980
still need to be done by hand, however, going

614
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,350
from 100 percent by hand to 2 percent

615
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,440
by hand is still an improvement from

616
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,260
my point of view after exactly

617
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,740
the menus not only for the menus let's say

618
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,090
hand programs we also have to

619
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,160
create categories  maybe the

620
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,630
current versions of the game are divided by

621
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,830
networking forensics discs malware

622
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,080
other race there are categories

623
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,470
so that the person using the me  nu can

624
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,060
also understand by being looking for and then

625
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,250
another very nice thing that so far has

626
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,200
been done in a totally manual way and

627
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,540
it cracked every other day

628
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,790
is the talk of the graphical interface

629
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,720
because it is a bit ugly to do everything

630
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,780
is to give it the distro that when it starts there is

631
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,520
the ubuntu match logo which looks like

632
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,560
ubuntu mac but in reality it is a

633
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,330
different distro so obviously we put

634
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:05,010
the pink unicorns as a background and no in

635
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,560
reality we took a

636
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,180
more conservative approach we are given on  black

637
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,800
on blue, however, to add up a nice idea,

638
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,840
this is also

639
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,490
a screenshot of the very

640
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,390
basic version of one of the first isa generated

641
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,260
with the changed theme

642
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,560
[Music]

643
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,990
let's say that by tradition the users of

644
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,280
those who are in have always seen the

645
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,350
distribution  with a menu like windows

646
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,720
xp let's say so once again we

647
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,330
put the menu at the bottom left just

648
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,680
to continue this thing but in short

649
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,390
no I don't think rowe would be scandalized

650
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,940
even if  we moved it another

651
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,470
interesting thing from my point of

652
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,580
view yes like some of the

653
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,890
main applications that are used more often

654
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,330
such as autopsy which is what you see

655
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,490
in the background and on the right window

656
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,790
are in java now I don't know if you know it but

657
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,380
basically the applications in java

658
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,610
on linux

659
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,740
if you use them for more than ten minutes everyone

660
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,380
's eyes cry, that is, they really

661
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,330
hurt your eyes because they have fonts that

662
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,590
have an alias in correctable

663
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,230
and a theme that is still metal

664
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,470
that blue old north jokes

665
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,210
aside from reading a  text so bothering for a

666
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,640
long time what

667
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,130
we did here was put the

668
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,549
corresponding gt theme i saw

669
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:25,750
that luckily on the latest version of open

670
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,610
ge the font aliasing has

671
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:30,429
improved enough so luckily it

672
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:32,350
has a similar look but above all  it is

673
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,570
readable without being bothered because if

674
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,940
I have to analyze many text files and

675
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,830
I start to see badly written fonts

676
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,080


677
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,580
I stress ok so a  In the end

678
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,830
what are the advantages to conclude that

679
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,130
we have an ISO that is produced

680
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,039
in a totally automated way is a

681
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:55,899
traceable way and is more reviewed

682
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:57,309
especially by other people

683
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:01,990
because on a purely theoretical level

684
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,299
maybe and nobody does it but if I say

685
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:07,059
ok I did  my analysis with that in

686
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:11,049
short yes but that in how it was done

687
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,179
who made it what did it put in it

688
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:16,929
yes who did it I tell you what it

689
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:17,830
took you need to call her

690
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,649
phone ask him why in this

691
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:23,919
moment it is not that I can say so we

692
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,169
did not want to generate a

693
00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:28,659
completely different distro like

694
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:31,059
linux mint that it generates all the packages just for its own

695
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:32,830
build tools,

696
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,830
no that would have been

697
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,720
too onerous a commitment because we need

698
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,249
a team of people who work on it full time

699
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:39,669


700
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:42,609
the intermediate solution was to say ok

701
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:44,649
we take an ubuntu and

702
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:48,039
customize it so that the

703
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,450
customizations know exactly

704
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,940
what they are and we know exactly how they

705
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,609
are app  licate therefore we do not have

706
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:58,179
the burden of managing an entire distro but

707
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:00,249
we can simply generate live

708
00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:04,119
DVDs every year as often as it will be and

709
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:07,509
we know how they are made then above all

710
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:08,919
even more people can collaborate

711
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:10,929
development that is if I find a bug on kane

712
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:13,659
I will be able to when we are regime  we will have finished

713
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:16,899
go to the pc tracker and write I

714
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:20,470
found this bug and then there are the

715
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,749
comments of the developers and you will be able to

716
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:24,669
manage what the bugs are which are the

717
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:27,759
closed bugs the open ones and everything

718
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,289
and the improvements being made

719
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:32,889
written are automated and

720
00:30:32,889 --> 00:30:35,830
therefore controllable  in the end it will be enough to

721
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,590
launch a vagrant up in

722
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,269
the vagrant ssh project directory to connect

723
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:44,590
place the iso file because we do not

724
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,659
include that in the repositories of course and

725
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:48,669
then I place the iso file I start

726
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:52,059
writes belo tac

727
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,549
I sit and look for 10 15 minutes or

728
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:56,380
how long it takes

729
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,680
computer that goes alone I turn off the

730
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,210
virtual machine and I find the generated iso file

731
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,680
and this  that's more or less everything

732
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,390


733
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,710
if you want to ask me a few questions of

734
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,710
course maybe there is something that I

735
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,670
did a bit of a run

736
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,220
hi I have always had this

737
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,650
curiosity what does it do that when it found an

738
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,760
encrypted file system that does nothing in

739
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,890
reality it is who does  the analysis after which he will have to

740
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,570
evaluate in the

741
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,190
meantime usually precisely the links

742
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,710
are made on a duplicate then duplicate spa

743
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,690
or in any case all of the disk

744
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:49,020
or disks then of course the fetus is

745
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,580
encrypted

746
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,740
I have to find a way to open it that

747
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,870
usually seen before school of human error

748
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:55,740


749
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,920
if  a user to choose a password

750
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,800
banalotta makes a bit of attacks and

751
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,590
dictionary or mixed etcetera

752
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:11,060
and if not it is that the data is enough exact

753
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,410
or traverses had cracks in the

754
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,390
cryptography badly would have

755
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,980
popped up before probably

756
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:25,460
going into production are other questions

757
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,420
no thanks

758
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,219
[  Applause]
