1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,659
hello everyone then in this we will talk

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,029
about the concept of a distributed dead man switch

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,990
first of all who I am I am

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,670
a consultant in computer security

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,210
I develop mainly in python

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,529
you will also find the contacts of all my

7
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,949
social networks if you want to link and hook up

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,220
immediately so today we will see  what is a

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,230
tecne switch some use cases

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,140
the algorithm says music sharing

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,360
the architecture of the system and attacks and

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,839
countermeasures

13
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,450
first of all a death race switch is a

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,480
device that when the

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,309
person no longer gives light bit a signal

16
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,360
of  life the case the week is activated this

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,250
for example is used in

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,100
machinery where, for example, when the operator

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,510
faints the machinery is

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,630
disabled or in slightly more

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,909
IT concepts where for example a

22
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,210
journalist with very

23
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,250
confidential material and if

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,280
this material is kidnapped, killed  is

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,850
distributed if any of you know the

26
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,310
one under the lost code

27
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,120
where there was this concept there as well this is

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,720
because  e in the current world

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,550
there are many people who fight

30
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,520
against the powerful who have all the

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,000
means available to annihilate anyone who

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,070
wants you even just buy some for

33
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,270
example, so you need a system

34
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,500
to help these people

35
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,830
examples we have the most interesting is

36
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,759
seeing others  I think you know them

37
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,960
where

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,760
the Russians have a

39
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,500
nuclear counter-offensive system is called if

40
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,190
with a strike that when

41
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,920
a nuclear attack is detected on the red only

42
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,130
and the operator does not give a

43
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,010
response,

44
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,230
a nuclear counter-offensive is automatically activated but

45
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,160
skilfully against the United States

46
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,970
in the same way also snow den to a

47
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,950
similar procedure

48
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,769
the difference is that he has some friends

49
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:38,260
probably some acquaintances who

50
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,510
when they don't hear him for a

51
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,850
certain number of days

52
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,470
spread his material

53
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,970
in the same way wikileaks has

54
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,940
published his tra valence on  twitter to look and

55
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,709
perhaps a little less known

56
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:53,230
he is a thor ha operator  spread

57
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,820
various leaks for which I received several

58
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,970
death threats including the

59
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,980
American android order police turn or another

60
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,600
concerning the Turks the Turkish government

61
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,070
also published on torrent

62
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,570
his insurance file that it is not known

63
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,010
who has the key in his hand.  moment

64
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,630
in which something happened he would have

65
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,549
published me at this point what is the

66
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,440
concept that reports today the concept is

67
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,459
a distributed death né switch so

68
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,130
without having to rely on

69
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,780
friends who have all the content

70
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,579
because obviously we have

71
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,140
security problems on this if they were

72
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,450
compromised  or if they were offline for

73
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,660
any reason but using two

74
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,520
technologies

75
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,120
of which the first is the mystical sharing which

76
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,280
was a little less known which

77
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,070
allows us to divide an

78
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,070
encrypted content into several parts and the second

79
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,350
is blog chain which instead allows us to

80
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:03,610
re-assemble it then  we have in

81
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,410
this architecture among the different types

82
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,480
of participants to whom we can entrust

83
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,460
the no  our secret

84
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,040
we have the taxes that are people

85
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,048
we know therefore people of trust

86
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,180
we have the tessellated seeds which instead is

87
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,029
a more highly reliable concept and

88
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,770
could be a

89
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,760
humanitarian organization or a company such as mozilla and

90
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,250
finally parts that it is a single

91
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,210
user who  aggregates all the users of the

92
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:40,210
system and therefore a single

93
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:46,570
bitcoin-style group possible use cases here we

94
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,680
begin to see

95
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,990
excuse me here as we begin to see

96
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,389
what a possible user interface would be like

97
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:00,400


98
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,419
so we have a journalist

99
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:10,159
doing research and a file with a month

100
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:12,979
of threshold  and entrusts this file to

101
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,580
several participants of these he decides

102
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,169
that only two participants are enough

103
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:20,229
to be able to decrypt it

104
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:24,830
using meo basso because it is more important

105
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,819
for this

106
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:27,500
person that the content is

107
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,500
decrypted and disseminated rather than its

108
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,919
confidentiality and everyone would see the

109
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,129
content in the case  for example instead of

110
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,500
a father of a family who makes a

111
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,050
will  so a use a little

112
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,550
different from what we have said so

113
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,860
far we can set differently

114
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,319
so without using unknown people on the

115
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,099
internet but only

116
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:58,520
trusted users with a number 10

117
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,370
fraction higher who are already three out of

118
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,190
five the difference here is that we have

119
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,629
a cone  of visibility

120
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:08,419
or rather only these last two people the

121
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,279
son of the daughter will be able to

122
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:15,409
decrypt the content the others no later

123
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,909
we will understand better how this is

124
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,279
possible

125
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,930
the last is the political activist this

126
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,879
case is interesting because in this

127
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,589
case we do not share a file because

128
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,270
we will have mild dimensions using

129
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,539
blog chain but a torrent

130
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,349
so much that for example cthulhu osno den

131
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:38,000
have files of hundreds of gb

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,229
so it would not be technically

133
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:43,759
possible to upload them to a blog chain in

134
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,440
this case they are not used between

135
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,889
separate but only two users or the

136
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:52,699
general trust  and it is a semi trusted which

137
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,020
could be that of system

138
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,840
we come now both mystical shari  ng which is

139
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,500
a bit the basis of all this concept

140
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,180
this algorithm allows us to take

141
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,720
a secret and encrypt it in three different

142
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,690
parts these three parts, however,

143
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,330
all three are not necessary to reassemble it

144
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,210
but two are enough these parameters it is

145
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,820
the user who decides  the freedom meeting

146
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,620
there are also online demos to

147
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,840
try and it works very well from a

148
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,280
cryptographic point of view also it has

149
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,790
been shown that it is safe so if

150
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,350
you need the parts to be able to

151
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,010
decrypt a file having only two it does not

152
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,890
simplify the work but it is anyway

153
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,280
sure the problem we can have is

154
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,380
knowing that the parts are actually

155
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:49,110
the original ones it is not possible to have

156
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,590
some sort of checksum and therefore if it

157
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,270
were compromised and one of the parts

158
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,990
it would never be possible to get the

159
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,919
original secret to solve this

160
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,380
problem

161
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,060
the statue of david mees locke  provides

162
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,900
a clutch man or the original user

163
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,990
when the secrets to the

164
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,330
various parts are on the way even in the last one

165
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,540
phase a packet of acrogym to the blog

166
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,370
chain in which the chef 512 tells of all the

167
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,870
secrets that have been sent to the

168
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,650
parties

169
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,330
in this way when

170
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,460
the user comes it

171
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,630
is no longer showing signs of life and it is time

172
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,690
to decipher it and  various parts send the

173
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,429
secrets it is possible to check that the

174
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:47,140
parts they sent are correct

175
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,080
before we talked about the cone of

176
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,590
visibility

177
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,280
it took me a moment they went to

178
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,630
then fast with the [ __ ] they tell me about

179
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,280
visibility

180
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,460
how is this possible because before

181
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,770
we said that  the number of parts

182
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:14,030
allows us to reassemble the secret

183
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,560
however we have another property in

184
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,330
champ car sharing that allows us to

185
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,550
assign even more parts to individual

186
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,400
participants so in the example of

187
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,930
the secret formula of coca cola

188
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,700
we can assign a number of

189
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,670
parts higher than the president  which

190
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,490
incidentally are equal to the number of

191
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,400
boats needed to be able to decipher it and

192
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,830
a smaller number of parts to the other

193
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,260
participants in mod  or such that there is a

194
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,390
need for greater consensus at low

195
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,880
levels

196
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,690
this allows us to create a

197
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,930
system where only some participants can

198
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,830
decipher the secret since we have

199
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,560
helsen bob who have three parts of the

200
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,670
secret while the others only one and

201
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,850
we have a minimum of  four parts to

202
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,860
be able to decipher it this means that

203
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,930
even if all the other participants

204
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,090
joined they could not decipher the

205
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,710
secret but there is always a need for elis

206
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:21,320
bob to be able to get it this is

207
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,790
exploited with the black chain since

208
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,719
when

209
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:40,050
ok in the moment in  which is triggered by

210
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,230
the signal that loughner is no

211
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,660
longer active so it is necessary to decipher the

212
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,570
secret that has shared only the

213
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,220
participants who have no right of

214
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,829
visibility send their secret

215
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:58,140
publicly on the block chain and from the

216
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,370
example we have seen before it is not

217
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,320
necessary that everyone  they send him for

218
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,570
example we haring that offline but

219
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,190
his contribution is not necessary because

220
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,310
we need it  no of four parts and

221
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,540
three have them and the ice and bob then chooses

222
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,250
david they share their part of the

223
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,760
secret and alice bob reading the blog

224
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,360
chain can decipher the secret

225
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,560
independently without having to publish anything

226
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,079
differently in a without the canons of

227
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,970
visibility we would also have  the two of them would

228
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,980
share their secret and

229
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,779
anyone could decrypt the original file

230
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,839


231
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,260
this is done using a minimum of

232
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,070
formulas that I don't want to bore you

233
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,920
now on basic math the

234
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,279
concept is that normally a part

235
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,010
is assigned to a person

236
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,810
when there is  still visibility

237
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,329
a number of larger parts are assigned

238
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:00,690
to those who can decrypt

239
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,480
taking into account the fact that those who cannot

240
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,640
decrypt even if they all

241
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,290
joined together will never be able to decipher the

242
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:15,510
original content so this is a

243
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,190
bit of an introduction now I will

244
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,440
show you a diagram  sequence to

245
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,269
better understand what would be the

246
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:24,470
real operation

247
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,040
we have some allowed

248
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,650
ok you have to if

249
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,040
ntire we have and the ice that we say yes to the

250
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,510
journalist who has a secret she

251
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,770
encrypts her file and on the way to all the parties

252
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,640
who decide a part of her secret at

253
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,960
this point there is a phase of

254
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,540
concrete where all the parties must

255
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,490
confirm  they had received it on the abc

256
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,050
chain

257
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,900
so everything is public and once

258
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,720
all the parties have confirmed it is the

259
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,720
same send a further confirmation

260
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,970
at this point we know that all the

261
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,830
participants have the

262
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,400
decryption key melis sends the

263
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,320
encrypted file on the blog chain this

264
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,290
usually  it will be the content itself in the

265
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,900
case of particularly large files it

266
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,130
could be a torrent

267
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,750
at this point we have the second phase

268
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,100
of control the control takes place

269
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,170
according to a defined time and and the ice must

270
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,870
send a control message

271
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,660
using keys to confirm

272
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,570
that it is actually  you at the blog

273
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,540
chain this message is verified

274
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,100
here we have the concept being chain we

275
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,939
will use a certain level

276
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:56,669
a certain  number of blocks to be

277
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,970
sure that an attack has not been made

278
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,639
or that there is a force

279
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,709
in the blog chain if the message is

280
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:10,430
correct and sent nothing

281
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,079
happens if it is not

282
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,699
received the various parties will send the

283
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:19,599
decryption key from them

284
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:30,060
the possible attacks that can be

285
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,250
made against this architecture

286
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,440
mainly concern two categories

287
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,860
or an attacker may want to

288
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,709
ensure that the secret is not spread

289
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:46,620
so that the journalist does not

290
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,060
publish the

291
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,480
journalist's material or obtain

292
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,029
that material without actually

293
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,050
being dead  without that despite her

294
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,050
continuing to send her king beat her

295
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,769
confirmation message

296
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:07,949
below we have the detail so

297
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,290
the first possible part would be the

298
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,829
theft of a part of the secret this

299
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:19,350
impacts confidentiality to the

300
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,230
extent that we have few participants

301
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,389
at the moment  where we have a large

302
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:25,740
number of participants the comp  The transmission

303
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,660
of a single of a single does not give

304
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,769
particular problems

305
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,839
a different problem ah sorry as

306
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,939
countermeasures so we have an increase

307
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,380
in the number of participants and an increase

308
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,779
in the threshold which is the minimum number to

309
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:47,069
be able to decrypt the file a second type

310
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:48,630
of attack could  being makes sure

311
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,399
that no one can decipher the

312
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,790
secret anymore then corrupting the secret in the

313
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,740
possession of the participants

314
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,000
this could be particularly

315
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,100
serious because we do not have a

316
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,889
procedure for sending the key of the

317
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,220
secret there is not but it is a

318
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,430
design choice because this would mean that

319
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,790
it should always have all the secrets

320
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,439
and all the parts and this would be a

321
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:18,110
fairly serious single point of failure

322
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,209
so an attacker could

323
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:23,870
compromise the participants and

324
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,040
corrupt their secret or

325
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,139
eliminate it by making sure that it is not

326
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,000
possible to decipher

327
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,220
it here as countermeasures we can

328
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,290
have another number of participants another

329
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,180


330
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,490
minimum number of  participants to decipher the

331
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,830
threshold but above all as

332
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,480
we had seen before it is possible to

333
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,010
immediately identify this step

334
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,930
because we have an

335
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,250
inesha 512 knowledge ment that tells us kwak if a

336
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,510
participant has been compromised

337
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,300
the other problem we can have is an

338
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,790
offline participant this is we

339
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,200
have  especially if

340
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,840
we use trusted people in my

341
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,060
case I would use my colleagues my

342
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,190
colleagues do not have the computer

343
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,030
on 24 hours a day

344
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,000
this is a more difficult problem to

345
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,079
mitigate for this there are seeds between

346
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,160
seven parts so ideally mozilla

347
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,410
or l  'other asset therefore shares the

348
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,359
single group of all users that

349
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,800
being a group is always online

350
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,870
the latest attack perhaps the most

351
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,790
interesting is an attack directly

352
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,970
on the blog chain is an attack that

353
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,940
would serve to ensure that the

354
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,520
secret is spread before the

355
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,050
this attack is foreseen so it is a little less serious

356
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:54,230
than the others but we have a bit of

357
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,150
countermeasure  and possible

358
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,530
one of these is to increase the number

359
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,360
of confirmation blocks for example when

360
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,980
her minor crypto currencies happened 5

361
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,620
the attack at 50 by 5 percent they

362
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,530
increased from 10 blocks to 100 if I remember

363
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,649
correctly

364
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,090
another countermeasure could be

365
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,840
used  merger mining where multiple

366
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,150
groups of miners that this is

367
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,919
especially true for small crypto currencies

368
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,999
come together and work all together for

369
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:29,070
more this currencies thus increasing the

370
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,639
number of resources needed there are

371
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:34,619
also other countermeasures that I have

372
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:37,289
deliberately not included such as the new

373
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:42,230
fox algorithm  take of ethereal that

374
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,080
works differently and makes

375
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,779
a 51 percent attack useless but it is still

376
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:53,759
very much up for debate there is a lot of

377
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,820
criticism about it so tackling

378
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,980
the blog chain topic is always complex

379
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,509
because we have many voices that often

380
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:11,450
say opposite things to end up we

381
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,149
something that is a little less technical is a

382
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:16,940
plus is a little more high-level

383
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,509
that is we have said that the user has

384
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:24,480
s  always freedom to choose who to

385
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,489
include whom not to include how many

386
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:29,309
people to include but the average user does not

387
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,499
have the necessary knowledge to be able to

388
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:35,369
evaluate these factors in

389
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:40,549
depth so below we have

390
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:47,129
some formulas that help the

391
00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:50,759
average user to make these evaluations

392
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:53,009
so we have a concept  of

393
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:56,369
very generic reliability that is based

394
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:57,809
only on the number of participants

395
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:01,019
so if we have few participants

396
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:03,600
our termen switch is unsafe

397
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,629
regardless

398
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,649
then we have the one that perhaps some of

399
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:09,799
you will know the famous cia therefore

400
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:12,919
confidentiality integrity

401
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,960
availability confidentiality therefore the fact that

402
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,440
someone takes  possession of the

403
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,230
information we

404
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,480
mainly lower the percentage

405
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,119
of the total users necessary to

406
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,019
decrypt it

407
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,640
so the higher it is the more difficult it is because

408
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,130
an attacker will have to compromise a

409
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,620
very large number of machines of

410
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,870
people the integrity is the exact opposite

411
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:46,100
or what is the  percentage that tells us

412
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,340
q  hen we are confident that even if one

413
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,320
of the participants his computer is

414
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,260
destroyed and does not have a backup, it is

415
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,060
still possible to decrypt the secret

416
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,530
and this will always be opposed to

417
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,680
confidentiality, finally we have the

418
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,680
availability that it could be a

419
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,940
concept very similar to that of

420
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,110


421
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,540
integrity.  I wanted to differentiate in part

422
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,350
based on the fact enough me on the

423
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,570
factor that how long does it take

424
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,940
so that from the moment the user no

425
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,780
longer sends light bits to when the secret

426
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,900
is disseminated because as we said before it

427
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,140
is possible that a colleague of mine

428
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,270
entrusts a  part of the secret is

429
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,010
offline most of the time because for

430
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,560
example he is on vacation

431
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,140
this is done

432
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,510
using semi-stand and untrusted participants

433
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,480
of which we have a reasonable certainty

434
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,140
that they are always online and therefore even

435
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,890
here we get a percentage

436
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,410
these values should help to

437
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,730
guide  the average user

438
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,390
according to his needs

439
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,340
to choose the various parameters

440
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,060
finally everything I have told

441
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,760
you there is no code at the moment it has not been

442
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,990
developed but it is a design of

443
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,680
an architecture among other things a design

444
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,610
thought about in the last months so

445
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:33,200
very young you can help if you like to

446
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,810
develop you know someone who

447
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,850
absolutely interested yes aid

448
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,270
is welcome it is not a project designed

449
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,180
to make money it is not the startup that

450
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,820
made millionaires because it does not want to

451
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,130
be that type of project but a

452
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,220
project that helps those who are usually on

453
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,670
the weaker side

454
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,460
obviously you cannot steal the idea  or

455
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,100
rather if you steal it you have to develop it

456
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:09,170
very well the cod

457
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,990
really works I had never seen such a

458
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,250
cool path

459
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,610
I did it especially for you and there is the link

460
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,260
basically the link below the

461
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,890
project of

462
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,400
questions

463
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,428
I will not answer 42

464
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,649
certainly

465
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,950
the project also includes  the possibility

466
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,970
that eventually the trusted parties

467
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,740
can voluntarily report that

468
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,080
the user is dead suppose for example

469
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,930
that the user meta a time of hack

470
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,790
ab  high enough so that maybe who or

471
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:31,530
against let's say enough time to

472
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,610
compromise the other parts so there is

473
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,760
also the possibility that

474
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,560
trusted users can signal in

475
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,810
advance that the

476
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,790
main user is dead, perhaps by sending a

477
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,230
return note to the owner

478
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,960
to ask him  confirms if this thing or

479
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,010
not then this

480
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,560
eventuality is not currently foreseen it is

481
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,590
absolutely possible because it is enough that

482
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:00,160
the end user takes his own

483
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,900
secret and publishes it on the blog chain

484
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,630
he has the secret in his hand obviously on the

485
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,790
client the good practice that is has

486
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,400
encrypted  this then there would also be

487
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,830
a part of your own client but yes

488
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,830
absolutely

489
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:26,110
the question that those who can

490
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,260
decipher the message one thing that the

491
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,809
main person is no longer there

492
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:34,570
are known let's say and somehow

493
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,620
brussels

494
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,660
if there is a protection system

495
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,850
witnesses in the sense that it can

496
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,740
take a long time to die and someone

497
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,280
can find all the witnesses before

498
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,850
no  now yes this is absolutely a

499
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,059
problem not included in the

500
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:53,440
presentation

501
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,450
one of the ideas certainly that all the

502
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,660
traffic

503
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,690
to and from the senses blog has encrypted

504
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,820
but this does not

505
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,210
technically help you can use or

506
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,500
any other

507
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,150
anonymization system I have not yet

508
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,010
gone so vertical on  I was reading

509
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,470
that it is not possible to use blog

510
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,980
chain completely from thor that is some

511
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,220
of the nodes must not use the tower

512
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,750
but this would not be a problem

513
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,540
when we use semi-

514
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:35,190
tax parts that would therefore act as the

515
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,390
center but yes on this the idea is that

516
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,860
all users simply have

517
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,200
a unique identifier so no

518
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,980
nicknames, names and surnames and the person

519
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,690
must know exactly the

520
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,000


521
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,040
identifiers apart from this yes there are security dots

522
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,410
that still need to be analyzed

523
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,940
thoroughly is an important question because

524
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,830
the first point is that if an attacker  he knows

525
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,310
he has to attack is easy on this

526
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,320
but we also have  another problem

527
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,210
or rather when I publish a

528
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,350
derby switch who wants to attack me with

529
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,110
a minimum of intelligence can find out

530
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,240
who the

531
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,470
pressures I trust

532
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,510
could be is not such a difficult operation

533
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,000
exactly

534
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,550
but why because I would never trust

535
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,130
a thing  so important to someone

536
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,110
I do not trust

537
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,330
so it is actually possible on those in

538
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:43,670
fact there was as a use case

539
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,670
that

540
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:54,440
a moment on the political activist that

541
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,120
his characteristic is that he does not

542
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,520
trust people he chooses not to have  taxes

543
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,380
share therefore natural persons whom he

544
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,610
trusts and uses only and exclusively generic entities

545
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,900


546
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,420
in this way even if his

547
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,700
trust pressures very well

548
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,140
compromised his by two switches would not be

549
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,390
touched in the least

550
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,550
ideally here in semi-states I

551
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,770
wrote default because one of the

552
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,750
conditions  and that the moment

553
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,760
this system is brought up

554
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,250
a semi is provided with default parts

555
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,220
but here the thing that would be very nice  a is

556
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,790
that organizations

557
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,100
also add this list and allow us

558
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,730
to have a system without people we

559
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,270
know so it would be nice to be able

560
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:44,059
to solve this problem at the root

561
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:47,110
at a technological level.

562
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:55,320


563
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,720


564
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,110


565
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:15,960
liked
