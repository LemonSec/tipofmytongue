1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,110
thanks for coming today what we will

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,080
talk about and the [ __ ] i will explain

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,040
shortly what it is and why there

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,710
are actually so many myths about this thing here who

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,890
are actually right speakers is not

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,140
important I do security stuff I am

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,410
interested yes I do penetration test

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,730
to eat

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,460
this is about the same as what I

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,269
will show you today today I will talk to you about what

11
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,930
is meant by fuzzing what is a phase

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,320
and I will show you some theories and one

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,110
thing I really care about which is siri

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,090
versus practice so that  what you

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,460
think it is is what in reality if you

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,520
try to do it you will discover I will

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,829
show you a couple of fasslers that are

18
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,829
interesting to us and because in my

19
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,329
view but not only

20
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,520
the right file is the one you sign

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,690
up for yourself then I will show you  like how to

22
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,609
get a lot of software that you can

23
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,290
grow out of the box what good is

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,619
fuzzing well if you say you fuzz

25
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,080
you are already in the hacker elite cause

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,090
oh god you are group phase

27
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,310
you can between  nquillamente go on twitter to

28
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,600
be cool and very briefly you will

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,140
receive an avalanche of likes what

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,259
is meant by phase for fuzzing sorry

31
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,750
then these are the definition you

32
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,020
find on wikipedia and on another site

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,270
that is enough for you to search for

34
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,220
description fuzzing I found it nodal

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,869
first results is very nice because it

36
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:41,700
tries to explain the second the second

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,710
nice explanation because it says it is a

38
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,720
spray thing technique related to

39
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,909
sending random characters as input

40
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,590
the request for an application no then

41
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,740
what is meant by actually doing

42
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,960
we can summarize the  fuzzing how to

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,420
send create something that puts

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,710
our target in an unexpected situation

45
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,000


46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,068
ok it is not necessarily

47
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:10,348
something random and it did not

48
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:11,470
even say that it

49
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,710
is a simple input to create this

50
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,230
condition

51
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,350
you can let's say we can divide those in phase

52
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,560
into two large categories  software

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,650
you see on the left from left and

54
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,080
those hardware you see on the right

55
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,790
today we will talk about s  Only the software part

56
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,650
because on the hardware side it is a whole

57
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,380
world unto itself for those of you on twitter I

58
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,050
advise you to follow this person here

59
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,630
who actually deals

60
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,030
exclusively with hardware security

61
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,280
also does courses and is a person who

62
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,060
really has the  hair on the stomach is not

63
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,820
mine what's the name of my field so

64
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,690
we stay on the software part in reality

65
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,940
unfortunately I will show you a

66
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,590
screenshot in reality the animation was

67
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,970
quite simple those of you who

68
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,720
remember the crash or rather the ex plate on

69
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,390
but  this in version 10 12

70
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,630
something was enough to press a few times enter

71
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,610
on a mask that asked you for the

72
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,170
root password and you actually

73
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,370
boasted the root

74
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,410
if you have not accepted a password on the

75
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,070
system jokingly a person on

76
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,500
twitter had prepared this woodpecker

77
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,850
that went back and forth  on the

78
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,890
keyboard and says this is my phaser

79
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,920
for marco is actually so he

80
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,080
could get broken when talking about

81
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,070


82
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,650
phase actually fa d  the software actually

83
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,800
many are ready you do not need to

84
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,360
invent hot water

85
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,870
Fri I have brought here four examples

86
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,030
what you see on the left is

87
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,790
sulley is one of the most famous if you are

88
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,850
also looking for books on fuzzing

89
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,180
you will certainly see it mentioned is a  bazaar in

90
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,000
python that some very

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,030
nice peculiarities unfortunately is no longer maintained a

92
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,770
person so decided to carry

93
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,500
on making a forte of this project is to

94
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,200
create buffaz those of you who do not watch

95
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,260
cartoons both salle yc ebook are

96
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,660
two characters of monsters co ev this

97
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,610
little girl is the only one who actually manages to

98
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,580
scare this monster

99
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,390
the third is pete faser pitch faser is a

100
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,919
commercial faser while buffon and salt

101
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,249
are open source it is commercial and

102
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:40,159
I can't tell you more in the sense that

103
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:43,049
before contacting the company  I tried

104
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,369
to look around a little bit how much it

105
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:48,929
cost and we tell you for the

106
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,909
fragmentary information that I found we speak from

107
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:54,449
30k up to the year of license for which

108
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,699
I stopped  I said but you know that there is

109
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,709
sti [ __ ] the last one I mention is in fact that it

110
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:06,269
is a very well known phase has found

111
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,489
I think about fifty vulnerabilities

112
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:10,829
in different soft sorry vulnerabilities in

113
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:13,169
about fifty different software and it is

114
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:15,989
definitely a tool from which

115
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:18,059
take a cue to look at but also

116
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:22,110
how to learn how to use when it

117
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,669
comes to phase the software we can

118
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:26,789
go and divide the fire into various

119
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:28,439
components

120
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,329
leaving aside the part of the core that

121
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,459
if you want the one that makes

122
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:34,529
everything work regardless of how it is written

123
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:36,659
the fire the part that actually

124
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:39,929
interests us is how I prepare what they

125
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:43,229
want to submit to my target and

126
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:46,349
how this something is then

127
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:49,019
used by the phaser to create

128
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,659
something unexpected ok so

129
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,149
a rule that describes me for example a

130
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:57,989
protocol and how  within this

131
00:05:57,989 --> 00:06:00,979
description various fields will be

132
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:03,209
initialized with values that decide the

133
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:08,039
phase is very nice to grow the software

134
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,199
is absolutely  It is useless to grow it if we

135
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,369
do not know how we did it break

136
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:16,860
ifad normally try to do as

137
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,779
soon as possible to give me a result for

138
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:23,309
which they find thousands of interactions

139
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:25,319
per second so if you let it run

140
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,269
maybe a couple of days then went to

141
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:29,279
double check the phaser you find that it is

142
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,119
approved  175,000 different interactions

143
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,679
your crusader software but you don't know

144
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:37,829
which of the 175,000 was actually

145
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:38,729


146
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:41,370
due to the crash you can try it hand

147
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,020
you can relaunch it externally to look

148
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,370
at the penultimate one you lose a

149
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,229
day and a half of life watching it

150
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:48,360
so normally the fans also allow you

151
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,069
to monitor what is

152
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:53,689
happening to understand who created what

153
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:56,339
you also have an interface someone

154
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:57,960
allows you to have a web interface

155
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,089
someone else a little more crude and

156
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,409
allows you to use an in-phase

157
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:03,900
command line interface it depends

158
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,479
is not is not  that it is nothing particular

159
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,539
the important thing is that it gives you the

160
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,680
information you have b  isogno

161
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,740
let's say that the most important part

162
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,930
in my opinion of a phase that

163
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,610
you really need to try to understand

164
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,860
beyond how it works is how I can

165
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,770
describe the interaction with my

166
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,039
target and how within this

167
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,930
description of this scheme if you want

168
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,149
the phaser  it will initialize the various

169
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:36,559
fields and approve the various interactions

170
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:40,520
what I bring you is an example of a

171
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,430
description of a protocol with

172
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,469
buffon I apologize for the fact that I

173
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:49,560
had to blur some parts but

174
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,699
this is a project that I am carrying

175
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,270
out on  a software of which in via

176
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,339
tion I have some details that at the moment

177
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:59,129
I cannot to which I cannot

178
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:01,709
disclose the idea anyway you have is

179
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:03,850
enough

180
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,260
that you can understand enough holy

181
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,640
cession of the fields that are defined

182
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,040
as static so the phase will take

183
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,440
them as they are  if they are

184
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,210
limiter fields there are fields for example

185
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,000
being string the first iteration the

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,560
phaser will send to what you put

187
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,540
in from the second in

188
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,870
teration onwards buffaz will start generating input

189
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,940
see how it behaves it will teach

190
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,900
numbers it will insert letters it will

191
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,590
insert as they say very very

192
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,870
long inputs inputs with very

193
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,299
particular characters and in all this continues to

194
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,799
monitor what happens on

195
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,159
the other side  that is, if I receive a response in

196
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,020
this case 22 requests have been defined here

197
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,690
through a direct protocol

198
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,860
this is an application protocol

199
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,970
described based on http and I do

200
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,470
nothing but go to define various fields

201
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,360
of the payload races and go

202
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,420
submit them what buffaz does is

203
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,640
take note  this scheme is going

204
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,490
to generate some input the part let's say

205
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,170
that 111 bites is missing from the transmission to

206
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,730
the authorization part you see below

207
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,360
is the part of the payload generated by buffon

208
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,010
and sent muffat as forbidden it

209
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,230
also goes to monitor what the

210
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,360
reply he sends  an input expects

211
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,830
an answer formed by a

212
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,840
way seamstress says the answer is correct

213
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,660
perf  so the target is still on I go with

214
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,910
the next iteration if the target does not

215
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,370
respond you can decide how to

216
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,660
operate

217
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,100
stop the phaser restart to you the target

218
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,840
try to continually submit

219
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,100
because maybe it is just a matter of

220
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,050
time out and you have network problems there

221
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,450
there are various reactions that you can

222
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,460
choose as I told you this is more or

223
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,430
less how a phaser works in the theory

224
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,760
I anticipated you create the input

225
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,610
below you put it in the theory in practice

226
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,920
if you go to see 95 percent

227
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,050
of the agents who are on the net  of how to

228
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,840
use how to do it sorry fuzzing the

229
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,350
answer you find is this then

230
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,600
this is an example if you want a little

231
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,880
pulled by the hair of what can

232
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,730
be fuzzing in this case here is

233
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,470
clearly an example but it makes you

234
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,990
understand what we are  talking so many

235
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,710
times we talk about income butorova [ __ ] and

236
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,320
I hope that some thing grows you have

237
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,460
luck every now and then it

238
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,710
actually works it works well for example

239
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,650
like you  I anticipated cup before it has

240
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,120
problems if it is not written

241
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,260
correctly it

242
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,090
may be that you try to lose

243
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,950
thousands of inputs first after you go to

244
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,780
have memory management problems

245
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,290


246
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,360
the application grows and you if you

247
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,190
actually send [ __ ] [ __ ] you are

248
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,620
lucky and you get  actually a

249
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,980
crash in the theory to be a hacker

250
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,170
a ok I take python I make it generate

251
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,820
a hair of the long I send it and it is that

252
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,070
something that will leave this done I

253
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,760
write to myself the former light I become famous to us it

254
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,200
does not work so

255
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,580
first thing when it comes to  paddling

256
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,110
if you take a phase how can it be

257
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,870
buffaz american phases love what you

258
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,520
want

259
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,690
normally you have some

260
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,720
default options example how to generate some input

261
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,210
this is wanted because we wanted to have

262
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,490
a default option that works

263
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,200
because so started using

264
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,380
those default options  and understand if

265
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,360
everything stands and then in theory

266
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,400
you should start doing all

267
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,650
your customization n  In reality

268
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,980
this is done very little so you

269
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,200
take the puzzle you throw it as

270
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,120
it is is that left alone a hacker did not

271
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,920
leave the software is not vulnerable

272
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,050
the other the other problem is the

273
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,080
standard behavior of

274
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,590
the dl phase the  phaser as we will see also

275
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,040
afterwards it has a predictable behavior

276
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,780
because because if you want to launch

277
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,330
the phaser twice you put that in the summer the father

278
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,550
finds a crash you re-launch it you want to

279
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,620
have exactly the same iterations

280
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,450
to have the crash again check it you

281
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,980
can do all your tuning and

282
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,950
yours your analysis what

283
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,840
does this mean that if I launch the phaser

284
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,900
I get one with the default options

285
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,830
I get interactions if he loops

286
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,040
the phaser with the same options will get

287
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,850
exactly the same interactions

288
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,570
then there are preconditions for

289
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,060
reaching parts  of example code we

290
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,710
imagine that you we want to

291
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,530
interact with a web service this

292
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,510
web service is authenticated if I send

293
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,660
random stuff is mo  It is very likely that I am

294
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,950
only trying the first iteration,

295
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,650
that is probably the authentication but

296
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,570
I am not trying what is after

297
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,060
the authentication so it may be that

298
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,250
to reach some parts of code and

299
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,040
therefore have a broad and cod cover I have

300
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,870
to  respect the conditions and

301
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,310
must respect what is

302
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,370
called the end state machine therefore

303
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,840
the set of various states in which the

304
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,090
software must be found to reach

305
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,670
that particular point of code

306
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,250
this thing here also works with

307
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,040
protocols you can make a software

308
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,630
but in reality  you can also make a

309
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,350
protocol

310
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,750
if you find a problem in a

311
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,630
software you report it the software is

312
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,660
probably and hopefully broken and

313
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,830
everything goes back as before

314
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,730
if you find a problem in the

315
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,810
finished state description of a

316
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,800
protocol are dicks because all the

317
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,600
implementations of that  protocol them

318
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,150
will have to be readjusted that

319
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,420
protocol will have to be is spent and

320
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,370
corrected this thing here has an impa  tto

321
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,380
huge because there will be several

322
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,240
implementations of this protocol

323
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,570
if you want to have something that has

324
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,340
a very long persistence because

325
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,800
maybe you sell them zero day go to

326
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,499
work on the protocols and much more

327
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:09,939
time consuming but it

328
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:12,579
can't give much more duration than

329
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:13,809
you  went to produce and therefore

330
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,099
probably the price that will be

331
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:18,519
paid will be much higher the other thing

332
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,929
is that typically unfortunately those who care

333
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,729
about computer security the first thing

334
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:26,709
they do is take the piss and the

335
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:28,869
developers can stay there a few times

336
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,699
from the other times  other times the

337
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:32,679
developers know a lot more than

338
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,289
we do because because we simply

339
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:38,079
have interactions with 250 million

340
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,549
different technologies

341
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,039
the developer usually uses a

342
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,839
little less and becomes much more

343
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,119
vertical so maybe the framework

344
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,949
knows me much better than us that

345
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:49,209
language  he knows him

346
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:51,279
much better than us so he is much

347
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,189
better than us  calm down a moment

348
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:56,379
let's try to stay relaxed indeed

349
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,239
many times you can take advantage of the

350
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:00,189
developers and let you teach something

351
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:02,349
that maybe penetration test after which

352
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:04,629
the other thing that

353
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:06,219
normally developers are very

354
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:08,289
good at using tools

355
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:09,759
create for example bill system that can also be useful  we

356
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,259
dream they know how to configure the

357
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:15,189
development machines in a fairly

358
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:18,939
correct way i phase ii are also used

359
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:20,739
if they can take them too from ge

360
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:22,779
tabs they can be configured they can

361
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:25,989
dance if we go to

362
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:29,199
use the fas on products in products

363
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,739
meant both  known open source commercials it

364
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:33,759
is likely that we do not find

365
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,499
anything because because maybe they have already

366
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:39,179
been used against that target

367
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:42,159
the other thing is that each phase of the

368
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,859
advantages and disadvantages for which for

369
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:47,829
example there are some American phases,

370
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:51,759
for example, the op is super cool  for local programs

371
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,799
that is able to generate vi of the

372
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,959
input simulate the user simulate the

373
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,659
files that come  or read while for example

374
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,909
buffaz is used for fuzzing

375
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:03,159
on network protocols you can

376
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,469
probably never have done it probably

377
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:07,719
you can use it to attack

378
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,369
something local then generate

379
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,819
files and see the interaction of the target

380
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:15,069
but it is specialized on the part  network

381
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:17,049
because for example buffaz allows you to

382
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:18,860
describe the protocols has not

383
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,840
a super cool way a bit rigid but

384
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,840
super cool so even there choosing the

385
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,390
right phaser for what you

386
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,920
want to get can be an idea to

387
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,780
take a as they say in one phase

388
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,730
relaunch it  against some

389
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,610
target in some target it works

390
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,590
well unfortunately it is not always said that

391
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,170
you can manage the crash I

392
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,560
mean take a router ok it

393
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,540
started throwing in 9 you see that

394
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,130
at a certain point that input

395
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,310
actually makes the perfect web server grow

396
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,450
oil crash ready to write them xplor no

397
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,850
to touch an exploit they want a lot

398
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,130
of other ancillary things that maybe later

399
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,140
we will see

400
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,390
and  for example maybe in a home router

401
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,130
you have to have access in some

402
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,990
way to be able to understand

403
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,880
what is happening before writing

404
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,160
the ex plate it is not said that this is

405
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,599
always something that can be done in half an hour it

406
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,130
may be that maybe  that device

407
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,930
ii is particularly badass or

408
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,030
particularly poorly documented for which

409
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,890
you must also pour all the pd to

410
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,480
understand what is inside you

411
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,280
do not find ports maybe the

412
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,720
az port that the serial port on a

413
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,400
disable so you have to find a

414
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,560
way to interact anyway not  you can

415
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,410
disassemble the flash because it soldered in

416
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,460
smd so I challenge you to chip off

417
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,410
and do it heated somewhere else

418
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,390
and interact there are all

419
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,290
preconditions it

420
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,440
may be that you are making

421
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,960
systems perhaps to do bug hunting

422
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,780
on platforms that  they pay you but it is not

423
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,310
said that you have access to those systems

424
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,050
to see what is happening

425
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,850
so maybe this service grows

426
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,770
maybe from  The other part is pissed off

427
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,690
as well and you have no way of understanding

428
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,980
why it is

429
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,080
growing.The other thing is that maybe you

430
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,390
also have the device

431
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,830
maybe it even managed to make it

432
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,820
grow

433
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,430
but from there to understand what

434
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,010
happened and understand how  exploit it at the end

435
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,440
because because the

436
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,790
operating systems are no longer what

437
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,590
they used to be

438
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,659
we say that if you want if you start with

439
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:29,369
the windows precondition it makes [ __ ] if

440
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:30,889
I write the ex plate immediately

441
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:33,119
if you want to write it for windows

442
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,480
10 because it is really something that

443
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,340
once it worked well now much

444
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:38,850
less

445
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,499
that is, it is much more difficult here is

446
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:42,629
what I mean will be a beautiful report

447
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:45,059
that I left you here let's say

448
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,249
only the initial cover I invite you

449
00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:48,990
to read it is a research that has been

450
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,720
done on the zero day market how much

451
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,749
they cost and how much it costs to develop them

452
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:55,619
who does it

453
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:57,929
how long they last etc. etc. the

454
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,960
interesting part for us is that currently

455
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,659
it takes usually 637 days

456
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:07,200
to develop  an exploit appears we are talking about

457
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,909
people who do this thing here for

458
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:11,429
work, that is, it is not that they pick up and

459
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:12,629
wake up in the morning and disney whoever

460
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,779
writes to me explore it takes 37 man days

461
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,580
to develop an export means that

462
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,960
it takes more or less two months  and a half

463
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,899
of continuous time because

464
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:23,399
obviously you also have other things in between

465
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:26,190
it is not a foregone conclusion indeed some

466
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,590
have requested as you see much

467
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,740
much more

468
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:37,200
as I told you the basic problem is

469
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,629
that if we always submit

470
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,610
the same interactions that if input that

471
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,909
is  series of interactions that is to

472
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:49,799
visit in a certain sequence of the

473
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,840
states of the protocol of the target that

474
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,690
we go to and with which we are going to

475
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,230
interact

476
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,710
if you explain to me where the next input ex is

477
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,139
or in any case the anec specter condition

478
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:03,119
is not there is not there  because why all

479
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,940
predictable stuff and how hackers

480
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,549
crackers do it how bug hunters

481
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:11,658
do it developers

482
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,350
do it what I recommend you do from my point

483
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,889
of view what I recommend is

484
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:20,129
parts  you with a target of you what do I know I give you

485
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:23,789
an example about me I like the

486
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,039
stuff I say absolutely so as a

487
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:26,610
target

488
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,169
I chose something that was on the

489
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:30,299
network better if something that has a

490
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,919
great impact therefore tends

491
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,529
to be exposed  on the internet the stuff

492
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:36,269
that showed hatching and super cool go on

493
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:36,820
chance

494
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,340
for example a bit of protocols see

495
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,080
which one has some million of

496
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,820
devices exposed on that protocol and

497
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,440
decide that those are your target

498
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,870
after which I advise you to

499
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,809
start analyzing how it is managed  the input

500
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:52,269
from these software that implement for

501
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:53,830
example that specific protocol weight

502
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,690
once you have done it keep

503
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,679
doing it get rfc get some

504
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,360
demos that are around maybe of

505
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,909
clients that interact with the service

506
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:05,980
and set was etcetera and try to understand

507
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,809
once  that you understand this it is

508
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,460
very likely that you already have

509
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,200
a feeling of what can be done

510
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,710
then develop your bone phaser  to

511
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,809
subscribe something that allows you

512
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,360
to try what you think

513
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,220
might work in my opinion the

514
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,019
most interesting thing to do

515
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,580
try a moment to tighten so we

516
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,820
recover some time and select

517
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,570
the target I will show you now a 4

518
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,360
place where you can actually find

519
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,500
tens of thousands of

520
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,840
vulnerable software used by tens of

521
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:49,330
millions of devices on sports the

522
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,559
gitav clubs old google code that has

523
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:56,230
been discontinued we like the

524
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,529
tale of open

525
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:01,929
source so much it is possible to do the queue

526
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:04,179
review it is possible  do the code

527
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:06,580
review surely someone will have done it

528
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,830
if surely someone has done it the

529
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,970
open source code is safer I

530
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,309
am not convinced because if I

531
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:16,720
have to attack

532
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,179
what I want to do is to have the

533
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:20,710
return on investment exactly like

534
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,549
a company  normal

535
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,799
on the one hand I have to take some

536
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:26,379
closed code and go to a repository on

537
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,330
the other hand I have to make a clone kit of a

538
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,720
repository

539
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,889
in addition having all the source code

540
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:35,679
the symbolization of crashes

541
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,809
debugging what is growing is

542
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:41,470
much more convenient but much more

543
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,759
if you go and have a little patience

544
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,279
go and see yourselves maybe not the best

545
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,990
known maybe you don't start from open

546
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,789
ssl which could be a little

547
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:54,279
complex but from the software that are

548
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,899
integrated into commercial solutions

549
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:57,549


550
00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:00,149
you will see that you will find a lot of

551
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:04,360
repositories corday disclaimer type

552
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,070
a penetration test has never been done on

553
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,600
this software so it is advisable

554
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
not to use it in production what

555
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,830
i'm doing it i'm doing it on a

556
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,889
software that is integrated into something

557
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:17,379
like 10 million devices to this

558
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:19,110
exact disclaimer

559
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,110
in reality i found it on a serp a

560
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,940
subset of these devices on a

561
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,620
version not the latest which is exactly

562
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,269
the same disclaimer the last one

563
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:30,940
still has the disclaimer

564
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,929
in reality because because no one has

565
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:38,110
time it is not paid that is and requires

566
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,850
a sac  co of effort to do a code review

567
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,610
of a software that is complex

568
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,049
maybe there is someone who puts himself there and

569
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:46,000
that good will but to take this for

570
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,789
granted is very dangerous unfortunately

571
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:51,490
those who develop commercial solutions many

572
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,399
times need to have so many

573
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,590
brands must  going out must put

574
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,970
something out for the customers

575
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,559
so open source software is

576
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,659
fine because free that is, it is

577
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:03,549
associated with free open source they

578
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:04,899
take shape and throw it into

579
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:07,450
devices the more or less it will be safe

580
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,190
and I put it on the market this is not true it

581
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,120
is a  wrong precondition and

582
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,539
actually implies that there are tens of

583
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,399
thousands of software worse than worse

584
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:20,440
yesterday's free when you compile

585
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,090
evidence must install these libraries

586
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,419
goes towards we put those in

587
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:27,220
there too I invite you to spend some time

588
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,899
trying to run more without

589
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:30,730
not even of hazzard you start to

590
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,480
believe more

591
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,009
if it does not crash then try to start

592
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:34,809
making them but they already begin to do  rla rushing

593
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,250
view you will see that you have found a lot of

594
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,430
interesting things

595
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,980
this is how much I hope I have not

596
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,690
bored you too much if you have this

597
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,680
question maybe I will wait for you outside

598
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,500
so there is the next person that we are

599
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,630
united 5 delay from the two minutes of questions

600
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:56,100
then there are hi  In the meantime, I would like to

601
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,310
clean up the terminology a bit, that is, there

602
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,860
is no commercial software

603
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,950
open source software there is proprietary software

604
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,010
and free software and it is not true that

605
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,670
open source software is free and

606
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:16,670
many large projects are

607
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,990
paid and made by people attributed

608
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,730
like the others  absolutely

609
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,950
absolutely I apologize for being

610
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,500
a bit crude in the last part what

611
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,480
I said what I said is really

612
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,820
open source is associated with

613
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,090
free and he was wrong he is absolutely

614
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:36,720
right

615
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,850
among other things the time to market that go

616
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,370
is the software  open source that

617
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,380
proprietary software with the difference that

618
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,000
open source and the claim earlall aic

619
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,480
in the others no but i des  k lamer there can

620
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,360
also be all those others and

621
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,650
we will never know it

622
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,520
is in fact absolutely absolutely

623
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,950
this in practice impacts what

624
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,090
I am talking about

625
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,180
in reality unfortunately no it is something that I

626
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,510
am sorry that never regrets a lot

627
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,760
because in reality there are a lot  of

628
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,970
superb projects that companies

629
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,710
companies that invoice millions

630
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,930
could support with very little and

631
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,140
they do not and they make millions on

632
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,390
what is the commitment of people who

633
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,950
may have put themselves there have written

634
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,110
super cool software but what I mean

635
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,690
is there  even the hour has no finite resources

636
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,060
has no way of seeming in common parts that

637
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,500
in your thor I did the glorification

638
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,500
of security baio fioriti

639
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,280
no absolutely

640
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,020
absolutely no indeed my sorry

641
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,520
that this concept has passed

642
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,910
what I meant is something else that is  if

643
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,159
the security

644
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:52,220
does not work it is a fact

645
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,519
that it is open source does not guarantee me that

646
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,489
this thing is guaranteed because unfortunately it

647
00:26:58,489 --> 00:27:00,320
is here  it is but it has been said many times

648
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,960
before starting to get into it and

649
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,729
it has always or almost always been

650
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:07,820
passed on to me the concept is open source I can

651
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,070
read the code so someone

652
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,200
has surely read it and verified it

653
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,659
therefore it is safer this is according to

654
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:18,559
me a very wrong precondition is

655
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,629
in fact they say it is not true and it is a

656
00:27:20,629 --> 00:27:22,460
pity because in my opinion it is something that

657
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,269
passes and I will say more that is I find

658
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,059
resistance many times from open

659
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:32,059
source projects that maybe 61 almost attacked by

660
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:34,309
this thing in attack is just an

661
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:35,269
observation

662
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:37,159
all here also because then we know

663
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:38,989
better that is, it knows better than me that

664
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:40,609
open source software on a problem it

665
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:43,369
has and fragmentation if there are 50

666
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:44,989
projects that do the same thing so that

667
00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:46,549
the resources for each project

668
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:48,739
are obviously less and it is not possible  to do

669
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:51,259
even with review you are never beautiful when

670
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:53,330
there are more ways to do things

671
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,479
absolutely absolutely I just say

672
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,769
that the downside is

673
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:00,529
fragmentation then  few resources to

674
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:04,460
test different software trying

675
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,179
to achieve the same goal

676
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:18,889
