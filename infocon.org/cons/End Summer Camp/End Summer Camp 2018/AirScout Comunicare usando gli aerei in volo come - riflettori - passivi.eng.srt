1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
good evening everyone I introduce you I am fabio

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,359
that after 3 f bz we will see tonight a

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,830
technique used by radio amateurs to

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,509
be able to communicate at great

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,190
distances using

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,580
the plane as a passive reflector

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,109
what is meant by the passive

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,199
sector we mean the fact that  the plane that is

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,670
the wave that bounces on the were is

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,690
amplified it only comes is only

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,640
changed the path of the is

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,920
reflected and is dropped on

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,649
the other side this thing actually happened

14
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,700
very often there is often a past of being

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,149
able to communicate with  some some

16
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,570
radiomators maybe in germany for a few

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,550
minutes seconds then it disappeared completely

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,430
and the causes were given the propagation

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,170
reality can be discovered this thing

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,949
here that is actually at that moment there was

21
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,339
a plane in the middle two years ago we

22
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,369
saw how you can marry the  moon to

23
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,750
act as a reflector, however, to use

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,930
a moon it requires both as power and

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,509
as a system, let's say a decent

26
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,970
station for  do this thing here instead

27
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,210
the normal powers

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,020
we use are enough that are used by

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,360
radio amateurs what this system is often

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,940
used and during the

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,080
races that are commonly called

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,130
contests

33
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,930
because because in the contests the score is

34
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,479
given by how much the km fi that is a point per

35
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,899
km  15 fi 10 km 10 points you do the 900 km

36
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:56,200
and 900 points so the farther you go the

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,670
better

38
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,780
how it works

39
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,860
I say it quickly because you don't go and

40
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,200
see the probable idea when there is

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,360
a race a report is passed

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,399
that yes  calls rst that we say is how well the

43
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,290
signal arrives is a

44
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,269
progressive number that is needed for the controls and

45
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:16,910
he hulk and thor hulk and thor is nothing more

46
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,560
than a further subdivision of

47
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,730
the latitude longitude squares

48
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,300
so practically from the

49
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,239
typical position here we are in jn 65  charlie lima I

50
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,709
identify a square around here of

51
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:40,310
about 4 km, passing these data and a

52
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,769
certain precision, it is possible to calculate

53
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:44,150
the kilometers of distance between the d  and

54
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:50,300
stations basically

55
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,349
[Music]

56
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:55,989
what happens what he wants later can

57
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,069
come to

58
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:00,869
us at this moment we are receiving

59
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,250
thanks to I drive the every plane transmits

60
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,460
telemetry information

61
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,410
inside to outside via radio on the

62
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,980
frequency of 1.090 mega giga 090 that it

63
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,930
transmits

64
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,850
of the data

65
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,080
about the position then what is it that

66
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,170
transmits position and that's it because then

67
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,450
the speed is given by the distance

68
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,840
then the city I thought it was given its

69
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,610
identifier however it transmits

70
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,800
a whole series of information including a

71
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,120
fundamental one that we need the

72
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,090
position and the  height because from these

73
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,530
two information we know where

74
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,020
the plane is and we know at what height and from there

75
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,030
we know where we are and

76
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,280
we know later I'll explain how our

77
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,500
correspondent so we know the

78
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,290
software does the calculation to say that

79
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,850
you were around and when  there will be the

80
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,010
time window useful for making the

81
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,590
connection, it is logical that if the two

82
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,280
stations are at sea level the

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,290
connection  o the distance of the

84
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,850
link is given by the height of the

85
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,339
plane so the higher the plane the

86
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,238
more the kilometers of the

87
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:21,410
link increase this is mono-directional it

88
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,940
means that if they see 550 450

89
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,990
kilometers they are 400 plus 400 then 900

90
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,160
km

91
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,790
in reality if a  a little more because it

92
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,470
may be that the two stations

93
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,570
are in the mountains like 2000 meters and

94
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,310
therefore the distance also varies and therefore

95
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,170
technically we are around 1,000

96
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,960
kilometers away on a frequency

97
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,680
of vhf up where these are

98
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,200
frequencies that tend to be

99
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,030
optical therefore

100
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,910
they do not bounce like the hf of the

101
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,520
in the sky and go back but go

102
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,720
straight away so they tend

103
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,330
to cover distances around and 3 400 km 5

104
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,110
100 if no one to do more uncertain

105
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,270
conditions with the plane it is the safety

106
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:19,800
to always do it as you can see  as

107
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,120
the height of the

108
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,860
correspondent increases, so does the range

109
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,770
of these so I have this as you can see in

110
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,300
a station with two stations that

111
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,950
are both at 100  0 meters

112
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,540
so I am in the mountains at a

113
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,810
kilometer high

114
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,799
[Music]

115
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,420
another thing that must not be in the

116
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,900
way are we will give you the example

117
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,790
in our case the alps the alps can

118
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,080
create a problem if the altitude

119
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,760
of the plane is too low because

120
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,880
the incidence nevano ends up behind it

121
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,890
does not pass over the others but ends up

122
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,470
on the mountain so the software

123
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,530
also takes this into account so that if

124
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,270
I have the alps and I am too far below the

125
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,040
alps and the plane is behind the alps  for

126
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,720
example he will tell me that the connection is

127
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,490
impossible so another

128
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,320
fundamental thing that suffers from calculating is

129
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,090
the let's say our optical profile

130
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,790
regarding the mountains

131
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,950
this is I am giving a little fast

132
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,630
because

133
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,550
if we have drilled I would like to fall within the

134
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,370
terms of themes stop me  if there is

135
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,680
something you do not understand this here is

136
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,310
how you can see then software

137
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,660
basically there is the map with all

138
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,200
the position of the planes that moment

139
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,860
you see our profile and that of

140
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,580
our correspondent

141
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,180
and qu  i tells us all that all the

142
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,670
planes that are inside this

143
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,290
purple part are planes that are right

144
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,330
for making the connection because

145
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,980
there may be cases where you have more than one

146
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,120
plane inside this case there is

147
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,370
only one  that this is here that you see in

148
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,610
purple so this station that here in

149
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,440
venice is communicating with this that

150
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,720
in germany

151
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,150
through this plane the software

152
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,400
tells you the position and now you can't see it

153
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,580
but it also tells how many minutes it has entered

154
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,890
and how many minutes it is still  seconds and

155
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,420
what is still good for the

156
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,380
connection attention that there are here

157
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,270
there is none but there may be other

158
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,630
rich ones can enter become active

159
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,990
and therefore continue to generate

160
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,590
connection is interesting because

161
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,060
depending on the incidence of

162
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,330
the how they say of the  entry of the

163
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,740
plane because in this case the plane

164
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,130
enters

165
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:08,180
as the line is said transversely

166
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,100
if instead it is parallel to the line the

167
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,890
connection lasts longer so an

168
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,440
airplane that is parallel  lo to this line

169
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,670
which therefore was a direction that is towards

170
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,010
the destination operator or the one he

171
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,770
is calling tends to have a longer duration

172
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,280


173
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,190
when it passes through through the duration

174
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,660
is shorter then also depends on the

175
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,490
speed of the plane but usually at

176
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,490
that height there  are always fast

177
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,270
software must be configured substantially

178
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,419
by inserting our call is also

179
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,460
the frequency because the frequency

180
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,130
because depending on the frequency the

181
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,730
wavelength varies from 144 meters and 194 mega two

182
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,290
meters to 430 and about 70 centimeters to 1200

183
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,090
a gig and two  indeed agi ge3 23 cm to 10

184
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,730
giga and three centimeters then bounce

185
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,670
then changes according to the

186
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,340
frequency you go enter the window

187
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,380
opens and closes according to the

188
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,940
possibilities

189
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,320
this is what I said before to the

190
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,120
landlord that instead of having up to

191
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,510
four  it is further more precise

192
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,430
this is what we are going to

193
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,400
connect the z7 that

194
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:27,760
that low area italy tells you those b

195
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,030
then 596 km this is based  from these

196
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,280
two calculations these these here is how to

197
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,140
give longitude latitude for the radio

198
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,540
motors corresponds to the point and inserted

199
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,140
these data automatically the

200
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,750
software calculates the area between the two points

201
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:57,480
for which you see the plane of the mountains

202
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,110
this here is our friend  this

203
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,880
on the other hand so our

204
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,140
correspondent we want to connect

205
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,460
redemption that does not refer to

206
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,310
the first sense that in reality the

207
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,710
person you saw before is here in the

208
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,200
Veneto there are no mountains anyway who

209
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,690
makes the profile and tells me that at this

210
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,760
moment  there are two good planes to make

211
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,740
the connection on those in purple there

212
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,900
are two it

213
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,450
is probably one of these sooner or

214
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,130
later it could go inside to

215
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,830
make it good so right

216
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,180
now this is a link that we

217
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,459
radio operators that but this is  feasible

218
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,410
when we go to see the planes he practically gives the

219
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,780
name of the plane the

220
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,210
geographical position the altitude the

221
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,580
direction also gives the model

222
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,410
let's say that  from one point of view it is not

223
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,760
logical that if we have a boeing

224
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,010
what is a 78 and giant if we have a

225
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,620
tiny piper and therefore the bounce is

226
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,980
much less

227
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,890
distance to the intersection and the time of

228
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,000
intersection so at some point

229
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
this  now it is zero because already inside

230
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,270
if it wouldn't be I don't know there are three minutes left

231
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,670
for the connection in this case it is for

232
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,320
fourteen minutes it is possible to make the

233
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:33,600
connection the colors and the planes are

234
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,540
interesting because the gray one is a

235
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,910
plane that has nothing to do with that

236
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,620
route  that we have decided it does not

237
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,140
interest us that is it has nothing to do with it

238
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,580
is not interesting for us so it is

239
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,800
completely out of the way the

240
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,140
yellow one is an under-share euro so it is

241
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,250
too low to act as a repeater

242
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,780
the red one and useful height but it is not

243
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,120
yet inside the window  useful for doing

244
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,330
so still distant the purple one is about to arrive

245
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,130
instead useful for doing

246
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,110
these or those of that moment you can

247
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:13,470
connect as I said before the intersection

248
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,660
can be of this  type and this

249
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,620
tends to last longer because

250
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,870
the plane stays longer inside

251
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,910
the interesting part i.e. in the

252
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,630
window in this case it lasts less

253
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,240
keep in mind that in any case to make a

254
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,920
connection it takes about 30 seconds

255
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,800
so it is not necessary to big  minutes

256
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,870
that is the connection on the races very

257
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,020
fast because they are exchanged between data

258
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,020
the connection is finished so 3 15 to 20

259
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,520
seconds is more than enough to make

260
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,860
the connection to exchange data

261
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,440
well this is not interesting this here

262
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,170
is just a curiosity information title

263
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,579


264
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:10,680
this  here are practically all the

265
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,420
air traffic that there was

266
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:18,300
practically throughout the contest that

267
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,980
is when a race in Europe is due

268
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,589
as you can see the black part on the tracks

269
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:24,389
of the past planes as you can see the

270
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,910
coverage is total so finding a

271
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,040
plane is much easier than that  which

272
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,329


273
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:32,430
usually seems to be only a matter of minutes

274
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,009
not hours to find a useful plane it is not

275
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:37,649
that difficult to find one and this does not

276
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,110
seem to be  lando of 2013 every year since yesterday there

277
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:47,550
are more not less so if you want there is a

278
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,350
video but here there is no internet

279
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,790
so you cannot see there was a video

280
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,350
in which you could hear the voice of a person

281
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,079
who did not  you hear nothing during the

282
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,000
call then at a certain point you hear

283
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,230


284
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,540
the voice go up you make the connection and then

285
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,120
you hear the voice go down because

286
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,890
interested anyway there are all the

287
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,990
connections on youtube where you hear

288
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,250
this

289
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,040
the two meters are connections in 144

290
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,590
these 10  giga these two giga and 3 1 gb

291
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:23,780
2 so you have the opportunity to see

292
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:29,900
different useful frequencies how it

293
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,480
works during the race during the race

294
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,500
you have to find the

295
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,740
interesting correspondent is interested between the

296
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,410
connection tendentially

297
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,170
a chat is used where all the connections

298
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,000
that is  all connections sorry

299
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,560
all people who are interested in making

300
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,110
that type of connection sign up for

301
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,790
this chat and say i want to make a

302
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:54,470
connection and i am ready

303
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,570
who is interested gl  i said i am here

304
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,330
this is my landlord you know

305
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,190
that information is essential to know

306
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,470
the position the position is put

307
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,900
in the soft software it says ok or

308
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,940
no but at 5 minutes but also ten minutes

309
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,970
but also at two minutes and dani  you decide

310
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,710
the connection must always be done

311
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,280
via radio

312
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,200
this is only a support to say

313
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,380
let's start and let's say let's synchronize c

314
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,110
otherwise the connection would be impossible

315
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,970
then the chat that via

316
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,090
internet is made only to

317
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,530
start

318
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,830
let's say

319
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,360
to see the possibility of the

320
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,400
connection then the connection and all

321
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,050
the data is always passed it is not

322
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,350
possible that is you are disqualified

323
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,450
you pass the data through the chat

324
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,570
the data must pass through the

325
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,720
radio

326
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,220
I am not here to explain it because I do not

327
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:56,320
see before that with the talk that this is

328
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,060
what practically is used

329
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,470
who  is interested in seeing the software

330
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,720
may come from there we can do some

331
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,110
tests

332
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:10,510
to get an idea of how the

333
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,190
slides son works  o been made by alessandro

334
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,770
example you avoid h who normally operates an

335
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,630
aspect of this type of connections

336
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,730
which unfortunately is not there because he is going

337
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,830
blog doing a race that starts tomorrow

338
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,450
at 4 is going near

339
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:30,510
guido's house they are on those mountains there in  high

340
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,920
and that's it if you have some questions

341
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,150
someone had already asked before about the

342
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,280
antennas for the antennas there are no

343
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,320
big problems in the sense that it is

344
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,760
better to have a directive eight elements

345
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,920
of the five elements forward you don't

346
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,960
even need great power

347
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,329
and logic which

348
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:54,790
then depends on the  type dario type of

349
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,860
distance

350
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,019
keep in mind that an 8 10 elements and in

351
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,689
any case an opening of 20 30 degrees

352
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:04,990
or rather up to around 20 30 degrees so

353
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,419
the plane is always inside

354
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:10,720
all you do not need to go behind the plane but

355
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,859
just point towards  the

356
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,750
correspondent automatically if

357
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,849
the vertical opening is the

358
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,409
front opening of the antenna more than

359
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:19,898
sufficient to make the

360
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:21,189
connection therefore it is not necessary to have

361
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:25,209
pointing in a  zimuth and zenith

362
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:26,679
to follow the plane because it is

363
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,260
absolutely useless it's like pointing

364
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,630
a farther pile you go through the pile

365
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,760
opens then the plane you always catch it

366
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,760
naturally the plane in sin

367
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,640
really a small part of that

368
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,340
part goes back and a  small

369
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,590
part ends up on its correspondent ai

370
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:50,850
is not all the signal there are questions

371
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:01,559
but we need this

372
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,780
good proof from where we get

373
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,130
all the information about the planes that

374
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,770
are passing to the information and

375
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,299
what software did that one of

376
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:39,590
the German engine

377
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,620
initially  he took from between ilarda

378
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,440
24 then

379
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,809
I assume this is a company I know it was

380
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:48,440
okay he

381
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,659
wanted money at some point to

382
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:53,149
get the data then this he said

383
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:56,720
is an open source product so I

384
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,769
do not see anything is basically they

385
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:03,320
are rowers between  which alessandro who

386
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,000
have receivers that the same thing that

387
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,289
for those interested can come and

388
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:10,779
see us receives and sends the data

389
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:14,740
automatically to a cent server  rale that

390
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,669
practically everyone's position

391
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:21,049
keep in mind that this is used here

392
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:22,700
in europe in america that is where there are

393
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,789
airplanes in africa for example

394
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,590
it is hardly used both because there is

395
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,330
a very few of amateurs and because

396
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,509
there is no large and therefore  it is feasible

397
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:36,169
only in certain cases, however, the reception

398
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:37,879
that is the positioning pose that

399
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:39,259
you see since yesterday is done by other

400
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:41,149
radio amateurs who receive and send

401
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:44,330
free of charge to him because he

402
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:51,428
is interested in giving other questions

403
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:56,370
well thank you

404
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:03,619
