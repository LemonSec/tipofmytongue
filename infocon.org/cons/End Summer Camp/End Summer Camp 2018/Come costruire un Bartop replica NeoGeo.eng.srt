1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
so I'm here today to present

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,750
my project which is a bar top

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,380
that I made in a completely handcrafted way

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,860


5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,080
in reality there was a small step

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,519
with

7
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,830
a laser cut but basically it

8
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,510
can be made in a completely

9
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,180
handcrafted way with normal tools

10
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,210
particular against  lacko manual

11
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,500
and so on I

12
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,579
will explain the various phases that

13
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:30,879
allowed me to do this to top from the

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,730
mechanical machining up to

15
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,340
the hardware software configuration and all

16
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,920
that could be said to

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,180
build an equal one is a project that

18
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,030
comes from my idea that I had  several

19
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,390
years ago then for various reasons I didn't

20
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,790
carry it out anymore and this year I

21
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,010
decided to do it

22
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,340
the first step was the

23
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,920
design of the kage even before

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,079
this step before defining how to

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,259
realize that it is necessary to define

26
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:07,990
above all which monitor to use if  sixteen

27
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,149
ninths if five quarters if four thirds

28
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:12,729
you want to use an lcd you want to

29
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,500
use a c  rt

30
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,390
the choice of the monitor in my opinion is

31
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,819
fundamental to then design the whole

32
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:22,810
kage there are projects already made

33
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,999
I preferred to build it from scratch

34
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:27,850
because no one satisfies what

35
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,999
I wanted to do because most

36
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,579
of those I found were based

37
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:35,139
on the sixteen ninths

38
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:37,060
me  I wanted to use a 19-

39
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,329
inch five-quarter screen and then I decided

40
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:43,929
to do everything so as not to have

41
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:47,109
problems during assembly, etc.,

42
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,999


43
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:52,119
so once you have chosen the monitor the

44
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:55,029
keys are standard so the diameters

45
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:57,069
of the various fractures the layout

46
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:00,009
are ours  download them from

47
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:01,810
any site you find online

48
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,849
there are many sources to find them and

49
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:08,860
I am not very good with the

50
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,230
design software or used

51
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,440
autocad that the only one I know I

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,560
only made the 2d views which in any case

53
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,760
allowed me to

54
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,030
realize everything  and bartók

55
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,709
obviously having some knowledge

56
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:24,599
with 3d

57
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,769
we are at an advantage because we have

58
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:30,370
a much clearer idea of co  me will come

59
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,099
to the top bar at the end and certain pros let's say

60
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:39,790
certain problems that I had

61
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,549
during the realization could

62
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:44,709
certainly be solved with a

63
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,069
3d design software that is much more

64
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,040
advanced than the simple views that

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,459
I made

66
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,129
the fundamental part to realize the

67
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:59,139
side panel  which is the one a little more

68
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:02,019
complex than the arches and defines the

69
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,840
actual shape of the bar top because

70
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,299
then for the keyboards the side panels

71
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:09,819
at the bottom are all

72
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,280
square or rectangular panels, so they

73
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,700
can be done easily with a

74
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,569
circular saw

75
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,639
it only takes a moment  defining the

76
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,700
dimensions the important thing as the first step

77
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,410
in my opinion after defining the monitor

78
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,000
is to create the

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,700
side panel so this as

80
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,739
regards the drawings once the

81
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,069
drawings were made I already had in mind how to

82
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:37,470
proceed so once defined

83
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,640
this I moved on to the next step

84
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,110
which was the only process I

85
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,870
did with a laser cut, that is, I

86
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,840
am  or had one of them created but

87
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,880
copied the design of the

88
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,510
side panel of the bar top I had

89
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,640
this one laser cut in 8 mm mdf for the

90
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,799
simple reason that the laser could

91
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,250
not often cut them above them, otherwise

92
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,420
I would certainly have made it

93
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,540
directly  laser this one of but I

94
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,720
did it because in this way

95
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,579
I could copy this one of but with the

96
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,260
manual pantograph with an end

97
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,168
mill those with the bearing below

98
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:22,950
you can copy the various shapes and it

99
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,240
is also I did it in anticipation  to

100
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,950
have maybe some accidents along the way

101
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,300
that maybe I could ruin a panel or

102
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,970
several having this one but I could

103
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,600
make several so in order to avoid

104
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,550
having problems but find it film at the

105
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,280
end with a damaged panel anyway

106
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,840
that had some road accident

107
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,229
I made myself a file like this  I could do

108
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:50,130
others

109
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,350
later the third step

110
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,830
was precisely to copy

111
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,500
that of but on a

112
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,710
16 mm chipboard panel that also  he that had

113
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,440
already been defined in the design

114
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,130
the thicknesses of the bar top of the whole

115
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,010
kage I used chipboard now 10 mm

116
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,560
so once that

117
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,840
manual pantograph was made also the

118
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,220
side panel finished on a past the

119
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,890
next steps that were the creation

120
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,960
of the front panels of  all then the

121
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,180
keyboard the speaker panel

122
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,650
the bottom the rear panel and the

123
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,220
front marquez in

124
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,800
short all the various panels that have

125
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,260
been fixed with te squares and

126
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,680
with threaded inserts for chipboard

127
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,780
there are simpler methods to fix

128
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,490
the panels you can use glue

129
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,470
however, there are many methods this is the

130
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,800
one a little more laborious but it is the one

131
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,570
that allowed me to correct all the

132
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:02,730
various errors created during the assembly

133
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,730
of the bar top because being made

134
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,490
by hand anyway ok start from the first

135
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,380
panel and everything is fine apart from the

136
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,510
bottom and it's perfect

137
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,270
go on you find yourself parts maybe from the

138
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,250
keyboard you find yourself at the panel of

139
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,440
approx  s if it is the last assembly that

140
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,800
you have maybe a difference of 56 mm x they

141
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,169
want I would never make them perfect by

142
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:28,390
hand it is not such a protection as

143
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,760
to say ok I do them I am sure that

144
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,070
everything is fine

145
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,560
with this method of fixing it with the

146
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,510
brackets  the threaded inserts and the

147
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,640
possibility of disassembling it several times to

148
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,580
correct the various errors which perhaps

149
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,580
with self-tapping screws you cannot

150
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,440
because once you remove them from the

151
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,620
chipboard you can screw them back up to

152
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,970
two more times then the hole is damaged a

153
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,910
lot so it is a one-time method  bit slower,

154
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,710
however, it allows you to save yourself the

155
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,800
various hassles afterwards so once

156
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,120
all the parts have been fixed I moved on to

157
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,610
making the keyboard once defined,

158
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:18,130
however, that the keyboard in fact all the

159
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,410
various holes I have brought them back by hand on the

160
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,160
panel you could proceed by printing

161
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,660
the drawing  and assaulting the holes first

162
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,730
I did so because I didn't have a

163
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,730
big enough printer at home and in

164
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,590
any case I didn't have any particular

165
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,940
problems

166
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,550
as  Following

167
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,820
the drawings I saw that they came out

168
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,950
quite quite right compared to the

169
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,910
drawing that I had done the

170
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,560
next step was to cut the

171
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,390
protective plexiglass for the keyboard

172
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,330
here simply or traced the drawing

173
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,640
the panel I had made for the

174
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,320
chipboard keyboard in  so as not to

175
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,320
have errors then subsequently with

176
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,560
the holes because even this here being

177
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,750
done by hand

178
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,780
there could be errors if you

179
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,760
copy the keyboard that is already but

180
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,840
certainly good and the holes on these made

181
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,560
with a common 30 mm diameter cup socket

182
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,410
are  find on the market at a low

183
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,900
price in short, with the pillar drill

184
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,600
you can perfectly drill in

185
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,280
plexiglass without special

186
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,510
precautions

187
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,690
just go slowly enough and keep

188
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,240
lubricated with water

189
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,980
I see that I have seen that I have not had any

190
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,740
particular problems with clay or various things

191
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,770


192
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,750
the next step after placing

193
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,210
the keys was to create the

194
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,250
housings for the joys  tick

195
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,779
these too here

196
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,720
the measurements have been reported love the

197
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,189
16 they were made with the

198
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:07,680
manual pantograph the only precaution is on the

199
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,290
depth of the millings so if

200
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,759
you have to make one, start

201
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,829
with the pantograph already

202
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:16,490
set at the right depth because

203
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,059
if it is too low the  joystick

204
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:23,279
if, that is, if too high the plexiglass does not close

205
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,529
there is too low you risk

206
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,499
having subsequent problems with the graphics

207
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:32,029
because you cannot do them well

208
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,509
stretched out they could fall inside the

209
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,209


210
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:42,259
joystick as regards the dimensions you can

211
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:43,999
also break a hair I did not have any

212
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:47,360
particular  problems even here

213
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,399
the important thing is that they are centered here is

214
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,140
the important thing that they are centered with the

215
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,630
keys otherwise in the end you see they are

216
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,500
slightly there you can play it a bit

217
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,290
but if you find yourself with an error of 45

218
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,110
mm at the end you find yourself with the  knobs

219
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,920
passed between them and you can see why then

220
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,380
the graphics were made on the pc and

221
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,120
perfect so you see that the joysticks

222
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,519
do not fall perfectly  at the points of

223
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,120
the graphics that you had set

224
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,029
the only precaution is this with the

225
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,240
joystick and obviously the lateral dimensions

226
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,040


227
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,230
I had already started biased I tried

228
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,140
to keep them a little further in

229
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,740
because I did not know the perfect dimensions

230
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,240
of the joystick because I did not have them  still

231
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,860
in my hand I tried to hold them a little

232
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,019
further inside the result was still

233
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:44,149
good and during the assembly I did not

234
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:45,950
have particular problems of dimensions

235
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,720
that crossed with the keys or

236
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,910
hit the bottom

237
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,070
so also here being

238
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,339
careful for a moment having a  moment of consideration there

239
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:59,329
are no particular problems of the

240
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:01,339
problems I had them with the fixing

241
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:04,699
of the glass because the glass when born to

242
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:07,550
cut it given a size you cannot

243
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,410
play with it when it is cut so it is

244
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,810
so all the various errors that are

245
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,730
found at the end, for example mine

246
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,920
problem was that the

247
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,680
speaker panel was 5 mm out it had a

248
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,910
5 mm gap it was higher on one side the glass was

249
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,440
not  it can be changed because once it has been

250
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,540
cut in case it is not that you can do a

251
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,810
lot

252
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,050
at least I therefore having the

253
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,930
brackets schools as I said before by isolating

254
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,000
the holes a little I managed to make

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,160
everything fit perfectly in the end

256
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,930
the result was still very

257
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:45,060
very good and the  glass in front was

258
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,990
fixed at the

259
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,480
back by two crosspieces placed

260
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,460
directly in place or I

261
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,140
placed the glass on I made it

262
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,570
match with the keyboard that mated

263
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,910
with the speaker panel and behind or

264
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,270
simply fixed two crosspieces about

265
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,270
one centimeter thick so that the

266
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,210
glass  does not fall behind instead below it is

267
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,610
placed on the keyboard and

268
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,580
the plexiglass holds it in position because the

269
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,690
3 mm plexiglass still succeeds

270
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,400
in imposing the glass perfectly

271
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,490
and above it is blocked by the grids of the

272
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,779
two speakers and a fairly simple method

273
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:26,520
must be done in work that yes because

274
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,220
precisely for  recovering the various errors

275
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,420
for the result to be clean must

276
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,290
be done on site

277
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,590
for the choice of glass I chose a

278
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:41,270
black smoked glass it is not very very dark

279
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,630
in reality however it allows given that you

280
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,550
use a liquid crystal monitor

281
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,210
to that effect on the blacks

282
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,910
that are slightly white because

283
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,760
they want the LED behind that illuminate the

284
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,520
panel  they let the light pass a little

285
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,190
on the blacks using a smoked glass

286
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,250
this effect is attenuated a lot I am not saying

287
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,190
that it is close to the quality of the crt on the

288
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,170
blacks however it allows to

289
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,540
attenuate this effect of the white a lot and

290
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,330
in my opinion even

291
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,980
the colors with a type stand out much better  glass so

292
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,420
slightly anti-reflective compared to

293
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,750
the normal one so I preferred to make

294
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,610
this choice also because the price was

295
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,339
practically the same the effect was

296
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:30,560
better so I preferred to use

297
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,270
this type of web glass

298
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:37,610
the next step was to

299
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,830
fix the monitor also this and the  'I

300
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,080
made a plate, a sort of piast, so that it fits

301
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,400
perfectly with the glass in front

302
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,860


303
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,680
always in wood using

304
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,680
the vesa attachment of the panel and

305
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,570
laterally it was fixed with four

306
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,910
metal brackets the ones

307
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,120
used for the whole bar top and

308
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,370
the inclination, however, was

309
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,200
also decided on the one in place following the

310
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,380
glass centering there too

311
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,050
if you have the  leaning glass you have a bit

312
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,450
of dimensions from the drawings managed to

313
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,180
center it perfectly even by eye

314
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,120
there are no particular problems

315
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,459
I had a small problem with the

316
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:25,280
pedestal that when I bought the

317
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,610
monitor

318
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,100
I saw that it was fixed it was a

319
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,019
fixed part with the whole body I could not

320
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:32,100
remove it

321
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,120
I had to cut it but even here after

322
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,070
it is nothing out of sight so you can

323
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,709
play with it you can possibly disassemble

324
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:43,410
the frame and place it directly on the

325
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,149
glass without the original frame

326
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:48,240
I kept it because it was black anyway

327
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,130


328
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,140
so it was fine for me since it did

329
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,540
a black burgundy on the glass did not

330
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,660
give me problems even here the frame I

331
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,410
preferred so also because s  and i

332
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,320
don't remember badly taking it apart to disassemble the

333
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,660
frame i had to disassemble the whole monitor

334
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,450
and the screws to hold the

335
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,410
back panel were inhabited with the

336
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,180
front one so removing the frame

337
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,940
for me meant removing the

338
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,910
back panel of the monitor as well so it

339
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,950
was quite useless to remove one

340
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,230
next step was to create

341
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,740
the groove to let the

342
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,360
bordeaux rubber of the side panels enter,

343
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,940
also this one here was made with a

344
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,770
cutter mounted on a pantograph and manual

345
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,650
this type of cutter is not easy to

346
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,750
find it on the market you will find

347
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,020
quite high prices because going  on

348
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,660
more or less well-known brands you can

349
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,250
also spend around fifty euros

350
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,830
for a cutter so I bought it

351
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,530
abroad it was a cutter that was

352
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,780
overpriced or in any case spent 20 euros which

353
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,060
was that it cost me almost as much as the

354
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,350
monitor the cutter however  this type of

355
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,120
edge that I used and also those

356
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,410
that are on the market

357
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:18,350
need to make a groat  ura of 2 mm

358
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,150


359
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,590
doing it on a straight panel is not a problem it can be done with

360
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,950
the circular saw but to follow the

361
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,080
profile of the side panels you are

362
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,600
forced to use an offense so so

363
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,000
this was a

364
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,370
forced choice because I did not see any

365
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,510
other methods to fix the bordeaux

366
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,240
because gluing it is not the

367
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,180
best solution in my opinion so using

368
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,910
the joint I had to make this cutter it

369
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,650
was still a simple job because

370
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,050
when it defined the right height

371
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,990
so that the center comes it starts

372
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,280
quite quietly enough direct

373
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,380
here too there were no particular

374
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,310
inconveniences

375
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,569
after this or I defined the

376
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:11,680
graphic part of the bar top then the graphics

377
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,950
were printed on adhesive glossy vinyl

378
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:19,329
to make these graphics

379
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,550
when I made them a friend of mine made them for me

380
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,060
and I have them  passed the designs of the

381
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,640
bar top and he made us will build

382
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,960
the graphics above so i gave him

383
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,670
all the dimensions where the

384
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,810
d keys happened  where the crates fell, etc.,

385
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,320
etc.

386
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,350
he built me it was a job

387
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,040
that came around for free I know they

388
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,050
ask enough to do a job

389
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,460
so I don't know how much but surely

390
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,110
around a hundred euros to

391
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,170
do a job like that  I

392
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,370
managed to find the places in

393
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,310
vector so it was a job for

394
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,770
him in his opinion very simple

395
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,930
having defined the dimensions having given them

396
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,440
the logos it was very easy with me

397
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,120
with about twenty euros I

398
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,040
got away with it because that was the price

399
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,750
that I have a few I paid to have them

400
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,350
printed the auction part in double copy you

401
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,210
seem to foresee possible problems

402
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,300
because if they are damaged not only very

403
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,580
expert

404
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,519
in robbery in putting stickers they are

405
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,559
still quite large

406
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,539
in reality then it was very simple

407
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,330
I did not even have here  particular

408
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,940
problems but for safety you do it

409
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,690
double to

410
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:41,870
avoid stopping me having to redo them and they have

411
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,870
been cut by hand do not

412
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,559
cut it with the pl  to get some advice I give

413
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,259
for the graphics and once you have made a

414
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:54,190
defined design that you have made

415
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,379
it is better to increase the bordeaux the

416
00:18:57,379 --> 00:19:00,139
bordeaux all the graphics by 56 mm on each

417
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,490
side

418
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,549
in this way especially on the

419
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:06,409
side panel which is the one a little more delicate

420
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:08,779
what you  touch a little more when

421
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:11,179
you get to the end of the panel that

422
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:13,039
collapsed all the graphics the burgundy

423
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,139
that advances you can turn in

424
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:17,419
on the let's say front part where

425
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:19,940
the burgundy would go and the burgundy you

426
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,440
keep it in position with this trick

427
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,570
in order to rightly avoid if  the

428
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,210
right cuts you have to glue them right perfect

429
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,799
celine collapsed crooked by a millimeter

430
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,669
at the end there are still some

431
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:37,399
holes left so you can compensate for the

432
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:40,250
various errors and in addition the burgundy fast

433
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,929
in position you do not have the problem that by

434
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:44,179
touching the edges are raised because

435
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:46,580
maybe  with the light with the heat

436
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,320
touching them could stars the edges

437
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,470
having them under the rubber edge being

438
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,750
increased resulting  the graphics under

439
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,600
the rubber edge

440
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,990
you can solve this problem so it is another

441
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,909
thing I did with the graphics once

442
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,330
you anchored them was to paint them

443
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,059
over the side panels the rest was

444
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:10,009
covered by plexiglas the keyboard is the

445
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,500
front part the side ones

446
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,970
organized because I saw that

447
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,159
even passing with my hand after a while they

448
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:19,020
deteriorate quite quickly

449
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,289
I do not know if there was a poor

450
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,419
quality of the alton printers and in any case

451
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,090
I preferred to paint them with 10 euros

452
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,669
of spray cans I solved the problems

453
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:32,720
and I am calm

454
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,980
after which one  once I had done

455
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,539
all the pieces I had glued to the

456
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,880
graphics and we had put the burgundy I

457
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,440
went to the final assembly

458
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,720
once you have the pieces ready

459
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,570
you go away quite calmly all the

460
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,480
really defined dimensions it was already

461
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,059
unfinished it was ready to assemble when ever

462
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,429
on the graphics I mounted them as

463
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:56,190
the side panels of the keyboard that the

464
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,059
final one is the whole I fixed

465
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,450
I put the monitor back on the glass and in the end

466
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,070
the result is this which is the top bar

467
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,549
you saw on the shed

468
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:13,820
out here on the aqua awning next to the room

469
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,909
done this I went inside

470
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:20,730
I switched to the electronic part

471
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,740
I used this type of  motherboard

472
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,320
some a motherboard with cpu celeron

473
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,260
from the 1900s

474
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,700
I started with a different idea

475
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:37,429
I wanted to use linux with the back then but

476
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,650
raspberry I already had the first version

477
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,340
at home I tried to

478
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,720
use it but the power is not

479
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,549
enough to run

480
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:50,399
some more recent games like the various

481
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:53,720
metal slugs already there he starts to have

482
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,869
problems with the lakes and talking to a

483
00:21:57,869 --> 00:21:59,820
girl the other night he told me that

484
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,379
even the 3 starts having problems

485
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:04,499
despite the power being greater they

486
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:08,700
are also problems with  with the 3 then

487
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,259
since I had this motherboard at home

488
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:12,659
that was not using it is very

489
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:15,929
compact it consumes little so I decided

490
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:17,879
to use it to use this

491
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,759
motherboard here combined with 4 gb of r  am

492
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:23,070
a classic mechanical hard disk does not

493
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,889
need ssd in short, I did not need

494
00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:31,639
to use other components

495
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:35,340
and as regards the keys I had

496
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,980
bought them that were together,

497
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,690
a usb card was supplied that acted as

498
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,539
from the controller then with the

499
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,850
standard windows drivers that  recognizes it as a

500
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,739
joy stick usb

501
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:51,359
just configure the keys inside

502
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:54,230
the various windows emulators between recognizes

503
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:59,730
directly without problems and for the

504
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,739
software part I preferred to use

505
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:04,679
maximus arcade which is a front end

506
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,489
there are many

507
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,090
to me they recommended this in a

508
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,440
forum they have me  recommended this because

509
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,730
then I actually tried the

510
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,480
others as well this is the simplest costs 25

511
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:19,899
dollars

512
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,779
this software but there are

513
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:24,929
many guides is compatible with

514
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:28,330
many emulators from the main hall

515
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,519
emulator for playstation 1 and

516
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:33,690
genesis acronym supports about thirty

517
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,730
various emulators so also here as

518
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,019
since the first time he did such a

519
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,429
job he had no but  i

520
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:44,649
used no front end

521
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:46,389
this was the simplest choice it is

522
00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:50,110
true you pay 25 euros but you can find

523
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,950
guides on any forum

524
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,029
anyone who has used a front end even

525
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:57,370
different is however first switched to

526
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,720
maximus because really the base as

527
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,809
front end as an operating system used

528
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:08,379
windows  seven for the simple reason that it

529
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:11,279
is easier to hide the

530
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,779
windows start screens when the action the

531
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:15,129
computer that comes out the classic

532
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:17,049
windows start screen then enters

533
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:19,539
the desktop with windows seven there are

534
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:21,789
lots of guides to hide

535
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:24,490
these steps of windows  and get

536
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,350
directly to the front end simeti navi

537
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,490
automatic practically there

538
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,970
are no problems from this point of

539
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,700
view there are many guides with

540
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,670
windows 10 and already windows 8 windows 10 is

541
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:42,450
already more difficult because for what

542
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,980
little I have informed I have not found

543
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,929
anyone who  he managed to

544
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:48,000
completely remove the windows screens

545
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,030
there was always something

546
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,130
I saw that wind  ows seven the emulators

547
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,970
supported the guides were there so

548
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,530
I simply said I prefer

549
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,290
windows seven

550
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,070
for this reason here

551
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,440
and that's it at the end as emulators I

552
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,950
used the main in version 0.5 98 which

553
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,590
is not the latest is compatible with

554
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,059
maximus arcade

555
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:19,540
despite this front end

556
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,250
the last release seems to me to be from a couple

557
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,830
of years ago it also supports the last

558
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:28,290
mame quietly

559
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,820
and basically enough he only cheers

560
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,820
from the link let's say in the games then the various

561
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,710
configurations of the games must be done

562
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,960
within each bricklayer the

563
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,820
name in starts  classic way

564
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,390
the keys are configured then he that is he cheers only from

565
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,430
let's say connection from the graphic interface

566
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,450


567
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,370
when you launch a game he yes takes

568
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,200
care of launching the emulator with the

569
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,780
game so basically

570
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,090
these were the phases that allowed me to

571
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,130
create the todt bar  you have seen

572
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:57,900
that out

573
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,430
if you have any questions specifically

574
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,620
where did you get the information to

575
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,730
get to the finished product let's say where

576
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:22,530
you have recovered the knowledge for which

577
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,050
pieces to choose and how to assemble everything

578
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,450
which I imagine you had the idea of the

579
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,080
finished product

580
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,470
I would not physically know where to take

581
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,930
for example the glass panel or where to

582
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,540
buy the buttons and the joystick

583
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,860
ok well then

584
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,650
the knowledge on the workings  I

585
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,210
was lucky because I worked

586
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,030
for seven years in the furniture wood sector

587
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,640
so I already had knowledge

588
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,170
from before for glass I found a

589
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,840
glass factory in the area that made

590
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,809
me the pleasure of making glass for myself, maybe some

591
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:03,960
companies for private individuals do not  they waste time

592
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,620
making glass in the various brikos it is

593
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,330
hard to find glass panels if they

594
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,160
are not found they are not of the right size

595
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,380
you have to cut them cut the

596
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,380
glass at home it is not so simple

597
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,200
from this point of view I

598
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
turned to this glass factory that I  he

599
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,610
was pleased to do me this

600
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,600
favor in short, the wooden panels

601
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,730
are in briko those if

602
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:33,780
16 mm chipboard is in the simple brico  icily a

603
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,419
little

604
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:38,309
everywhere regarding the key kit I

605
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:40,919
bought it on the internet

606
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,440
online you will find that here quite

607
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,679
easily if you do a little research

608
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,549
you will find in any case now that they

609
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:52,530
are returning a bit of fashion

610
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,530
old retrogaming games there are many

611
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,250
forums

612
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,650
there are also many groups on facebook

613
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,630
to say that they

614
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,210
are willing to help you give you

615
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,790
dealing with suggestions

616
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,330
let's say a decade ago because

617
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,070
since a project I still wanted to do

618
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,080
when I was going to school a decade

619
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,650
ago the information was much more sparse

620
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,520
let's say there were yes we saw signs

621
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,670
more restorations were not there were few

622
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,290
who built these bartók

623
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,620
these cabinets now however it is

624
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,240
much much simpler hell you can

625
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,790
find projects already done you

626
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,790
can buy panels already

627
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:42,120
cut  it is enough to adapt to the monitor that is

628
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,390
sometimes it is easy to buy the

629
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,340
kit already made the

630
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,380
wooden panels already made

631
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,990
you have to see then if I hear you  the

632
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,940
monitor more than anything else which is the part a

633
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,150
bit more difficult to match but

634
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,340
in reality sometimes there are

635
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,440
projects where they already tell you what type of

636
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,400
monitor to use with about fifty

637
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,140
sixty euros are found

638
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,360
precisely that the raw panels however

639
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,390
already cut then proceed

640
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,030
calmly enough that you will save more

641
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,210
than half of the work certainly by buying

642
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:28,610
the panels already made thanks
