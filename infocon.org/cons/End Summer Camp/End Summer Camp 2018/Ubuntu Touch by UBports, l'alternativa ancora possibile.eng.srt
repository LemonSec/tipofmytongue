1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
so little presentation of a lot

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,420
because i'm dario i think i don't know if you

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,970

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,210
well one yes two indeed we are taken

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,770
home because you don't know me i'm from

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,350
vicenza dress jean this is a view from

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,350
my house summer winter  I work in the

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,119
office

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,980
what you are talking about today is not my

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,529
profession but it is just a hobby among

11
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,960
others it is also obvious to walk going to the

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,090
mountains to ski lately I

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,149
have also started running but just to

14
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,680
make a person live on a fairly normal person

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,350


16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,730
in addition to this face  part of a

17
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,250
community the ubuntu community this is

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,789
the italian community and in the free time

19
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,370
recently started to do even

20
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,260
those who are called the coder dojo what

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,739
it recognizes in the

22
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,730
programming activities for children from

23
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,219
7 to 10 years old we will soon

24
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,459
expand our action also  to slightly

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,920
older children aged 12 13 15 what

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,770
he is talking about today, however, is neither this nor

27
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,049
that but it is yet another project that

28
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,409
h  o I recently took heart this

29
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,759
project is called ubuntu touch

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,159
I started taking care of it when I

31
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:28,100
went to this event which was held in

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,659
2014 in todi a beautiful town in

33
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,929
umbria and they made them that foot tax office

34
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,520
will be an event dedicated to apps

35
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,520
in the world of portable devices  dell

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,979
internet of things etcetera etcetera

37
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,829
had some success I was there among

38
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:51,649
other things to talk about other things but or

39
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:53,479
that other the first time of ubuntu

40
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,959
phone which was the canonical project

41
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:05,349
made to bring ubuntu and linux on

42
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:08,199
different devices  that it was the

43
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:13,780
pc that I have then it was a nexus 4

44
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,780
which was one of the first phones on which

45
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,870
ubuntu touch ran

46
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,390
then the tragedy last year

47
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,590
canonical decided to completely change

48
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,250
investment sectors and abandoned

49
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,650
phones and devices such as smartphones

50
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,170
straight up TV  to move on to something

51
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,870
smaller which are internet of things

52
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,190
so it makes

53
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,730
cameras refrigerators rather than

54
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,070
u-based robots  buntu the phones

55
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,060
abandoned

56
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,120
them luckily the project is not dead

57
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,120
so today I'm here to tell you a few

58
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,210
things the first is the project is still

59
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,940
alive and also the whole family that is

60
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,510
around

61
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,090
despite the canonical has abandoned

62
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,140
the development

63
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,950
after five years of  quite

64
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,900
intense development there is a small

65
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,240
but growing community of developers who are

66
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,670
carrying on the project from

67
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,580
where he left the canonical everything was born

68
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,620
thanks to this gentleman here this

69
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,080
gentleman who at 18 19 I don't remember

70
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,180
is called marius grips card  who is a

71
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,260
Norwegian he in his spare time had

72
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,890
begun to develop ubuntu phone

73
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,260
for his one plus one because he did not

74
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,660
like the system decided to try to

75
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,080
bring us puntuta cecè also succeeded by

76
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,739
this

77
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,930
absolutely voluntary project absolutely

78
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,600
unpaid it was then realized

79
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,880
around  to him a small community

80
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,340
that is growing and other people who

81
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,800
are contributing decisively

82
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,220
to the support  and the development of a

83
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,470
photo point another person for example is given

84
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,570
a kind of realism in now

85
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,790
we want to use this year in reality it is

86
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,510
much more because a factotum and he

87
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,910
follows both the development and the part of the

88
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,520
infrastructure so everything all

89
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,280
the infrastructure that was there is based on

90
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,020
canonical server now it has been taken

91
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,920
out the development has been brought to wii

92
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,410
tab for example and also all

93
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,090
the testing infrastructure has been

94
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,250
brought to him by the other servers this

95
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,810
gentleman who did all this

96
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,240
worked and is still doing very high

97
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,550
president the forums website blog

98
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,870
etc. etc.

99
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,580


100
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,630


101
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,320


102
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,490


103
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,380


104
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,010
'as wide as no one was a

105
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,570
beautiful phone a few years ago it

106
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,499
was born with

107
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:14,139
another system that was a derivation

108
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,809
of android I don't know if you remember that she

109
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:22,839
died she changed her name p  erò is still

110
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,369
alive and uan person is one of the phones on

111
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,860
which you can run ubuntu touch in

112
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,379
addition to this there is fashion those of you who

113
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:37,360
know fon1 towards another beautiful

114
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,969
project this is a phone

115
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:43,539
then there is the square I show it that

116
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:47,639
has decided to make a mobile device

117
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,949
based on this phandroid too, however,

118
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,750
so that it respects a series

119
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,650
of ethical parameters since its development and

120
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,470
also later during its life for

121
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,530
example

122
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,700
the components with which it is surfed or

123
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:15,610
come from certified and ethical work

124
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,270
even the same materials of which it is

125
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,220
made even if not 100 300 tries to use

126
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,170
materials from

127
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,180
certified mines etcetera etcetera you know that

128
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,330
in africa there is a bank around the

129
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,550
world there is a sort of exploitation

130
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,560
of the mineral resources of the place a

131
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,960
disadvantage of local populations

132
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,310
if in economic terms and in terms

133
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,320
and are only ethical but also ecological

134
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,350
pollution and anything else fashion tries

135
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,220
to put a stop to this is to use

136
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,490
components

137
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,810
ethical let's say in addition even the life

138
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,120
of the phone itself is tried to be

139
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,490
maintained for as long as possible both

140
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,410
through a continuous

141
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,229
software update and with the possibility of

142
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,259
replacing some of the components for

143
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:15,440
example the telephone camera you can

144
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,400
buy then modify the phone

145
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,319
the cell  phone 2 with another better,

146
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:26,090
let's say with a better resolution in

147
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,900
step with the times

148
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,310
other its citigo and nexus 5 st and a

149
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,770
much older phone much more well-known

150
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,449
on this pointed phone it runs well

151
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:41,389
one of the phones even easier you can

152
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:44,080
find it too  used on the internet it costs

153
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,259
100 euros and you take it home while

154
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,440
still being a great phone in

155
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,650
addition to this there is a series of

156
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,840
devices that had developed and

157
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,990
carried out the canonical development and

158
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,479
here you can see all there are the

159
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,669
bq devices at the top  the bq and 45 of which

160
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:11,060
10 bq 5 in its fruit there are the other

161
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,650
devices developed by the other

162
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,770
company that supported ubuntu touch and

163
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,040
when it was

164
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,250
on  pportato da canonica and that are the

165
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,770
meizu mx 4 and the pro 5 in

166
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,120
addition to these also

167
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,040
the development of ubuntu touch is carried out on these,

168
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,600
so a longer life span is guaranteed

169
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,490
than other

170
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,650
devices that maybe are stopped at

171
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,400
android 4 or 5  for example I have seen

172
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,690
that on the bq e 4.5 the latest

173
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:52,000
released version of android is 5.1 which is by

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,360
boh I don't know how many years ago

175
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,880
ubuntu touch has just released

176
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,520
even a week ago because the

177
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,100
launch was last sunday

178
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,220
released or even from four  for the bq

179
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,030
and 4.5 comporti brings a whole series of

180
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,050
improvements that I am not here in erika

181
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,690
in the near future we will

182
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,210
hope to see it soon having to come out

183
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,200
this year but let's say the wait is

184
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,640
prolonged it was still a bit purism

185
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,690
sorry for the book  m5 of purism those of

186
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,610
you who have already heard of it no 12 22

187
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,390
ok purism is a company that has

188
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,459
come portable now is trying to

189
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,569
build its own smartphone

190
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:52,059
also based on free software so

191
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,629
linux

192
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,330
totally open code ubuntu touch

193
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,440
will be one of the official systems

194
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,080
on which the brands will be able to run five

195
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,720
books in five precisely this

196
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,170
phone as well as a home kde

197
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,520
plasma and maybe even lines I do not

198
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,400
remember however I will certainly be one

199
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,960
of the operating systems on which

200
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,220
this phone will turn in addition to this there are

201
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,590
some very interesting ports that

202
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,330
are developing in the last few months

203
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,600
when I have made

204
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,520
them two are shown these are two Italian guys

205
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,730
one is called mattia the other stefano who

206
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,870
have just brought ubuntu touch on

207
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,100
these two  devices that are xiaomi

208
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,880
mi3 and bq more classes with two

209
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,110
fairly recent phones so with

210
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,460
pretty good hardware obviously they are the work

211
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,580
in progress they do it in their

212
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,070
free time even here totally

213
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,150
free contributions and are based on valium

214
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,580
I don't know if you know none of you have

215
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,830
obviously heard of al youm

216
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,150
which is a distraction layer for the

217
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,000
devices you are on  it runs android to

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,310
facilitate the installation of systems

219
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,920
books how it can be linux how it can

220
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,560
be a silent point on devices

221
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,990
born for android which is a bit the

222
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,620


223
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,080
current situation of the market in which we have

224
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,870
two top competitors

225
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,750
and then on the one hand google google with

226
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,240
android  on the other hand, the market is contending for

227
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,760
the biggest slice is

228
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,220
that of android it is clear that

229
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,120
the development of alternative systems over puntuta is aimed at the cold one,

230
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,660
that is, if the

231
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,880
fish that I do not know at what point is with the

232
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,600
red development in two  free linux systems

233
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,220
alternative to android

234
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:11,910
other fact third fact the project

235
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,130
had mentioned before the community

236
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,010
that gathered around the first

237
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,100
developer who was ever the scripps card

238
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,130
this community is called new people's

239
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,970
doubts maybe it's not just marius it's not just

240
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,370
dahl tomasson all  a series of people

241
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,080
who are trying to

242
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,930
develop right now give support to people who

243
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:40,310
develop ubuntu touch and they obviously do it

244
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,430
in  free way and therefore

245
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,860
absolutely unpaid none of

246
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,320
us is to give a better structure to

247
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,180
this community

248
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,020
the founder of ubi porsche who are

249
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,460
four five characters who maybe then

250
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,300
I'll tell you have decided to try to

251
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,980
set up and with a foundation you'll

252
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,190
be pop  fondation io qui force one show

253
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,730
a

254
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,800
foundation under German law on the

255
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,700
model of the document foundation

256
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,420
you all know document foundation true

257
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,950
raise your hands 1234 here well document

258
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,880
foundation the non-profit foundation that

259
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,480
supports the development of libreoffice you

260
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:38,330
know fis book because  sorry it will be

261
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,070
then but I would need a coffee

262
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,280
but I see that even a little tired

263
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,180
here is the short you before fondation and it

264
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,920
will obviously be a foundation

265
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,750
German law because Germany

266
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,670
knows better than me the best place

267
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,279
to make a foundation for

268
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,519
tax and protection issues of foundations they

269
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,899
have in germany in elsewhere is not based

270
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:07,790
on the model  tocumen fondation therefore

271
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,470
each associated with ruby port fondation

272
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,920
will not be able to count more than tot people on the

273
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,779
board of directors will not be able to

274
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:20,510
have more weight in order to

275
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,730
balance all the actors that we

276
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,040
hope will come into play

277
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,980
this is a becoming it should

278
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,540
materialize we hoped by July

279
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,510
August  it is probably already a lot if we

280
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,220
can do it within the year

281
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:40,220
we hope it goes through the strengths

282
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,149
of this project

283
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,740
there were some strengths of

284
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,949
ubuntu touch the first was the convergence

285
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:53,589
if you have ever heard maybe then I

286
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:56,170
mention them briefly but they are  some have

287
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,110
fallen over time and have

288
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,040
remained scanu and the first is to have

289
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,329
different devices with a single system

290
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:09,040
now in android devices if you

291
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,290
have an ask for an android phone in your

292
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:17,290
pocket everyone who has an apple who has an

293
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,060
apple will be burned on the spot  so

294
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:26,199
seriously one of the problems of

295
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:29,800
android devices is the fact that the

296
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,800
manufacturer typically releases a

297
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,110
device they make  12 updates and then

298
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,050
a kick in the ass and I don't give it to you

299
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,459
anymore these two economic advantages

300
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:45,339
obviously from their side the first is that they

301
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:47,829
don't have to waste time and develop

302
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:49,990
updates on hardware that maybe is

303
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,800
outdated and second is that they sell you a

304
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,380
new phone and this  perhaps the

305
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,660
best advantage

306
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,270
ubuntu touch of the guarantees the

307
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,300
insists the alignment from

308
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,340
the latest version of the system for all

309
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,130
officially supported devices

310
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,620
so all the beautiful phones that you have

311
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,260
seen before the official ones and that

312
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,740
you find then on a page of the

313
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,540
rho site are guaranteed  they will be released

314
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,640
at least as the bucks fixes always

315
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,930
at the latest release so you will have a

316
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:33,800
phone of 2014 2015 that will still

317
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,420
work with the latest version of

318
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,430
linux patched from all points of view

319
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,650
in safety and this is not a little

320
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,310
the second second advantage is ubuntu

321
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,820
silent is free software and is respectful

322
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,440
of privacy

323
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,030
attention that I'm talking about ubuntu

324
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,510
touch and I'm talking about the system  a I

325
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,700
'm not talking about the components that

326
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,920
are around us because every time I talk

327
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,350
about this there is a very

328
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,589
strong criticism on the fact that there are actually

329
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,209


330
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,349
on the devices especially on smartphones but

331
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:14,059
especially on smartphones

332
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:16,010
every night of components that are not

333
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,559
the  true these components range from

334
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,159
basic hardware that manages gsm or 4g

335
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:26,659
rather than even to

336
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:28,940
video card drivers this

337
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,649
unfortunately at the moment they are irreplaceable

338
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:37,279
pieces of hardware mixed with

339
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,070
software that are released together

340
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,140
with the mobile phone and unfortunately

341
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,080
the same card drivers are irreplaceable

342
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,149
graphics card graphics of

343
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:51,890
arm processors to the kind of

344
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,010
mobile phones are rarely books and or

345
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,500
maybe I have seen one all the others

346
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,429
are systems that use proprietary graphics drivers

347
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:04,760
so obviously within the limits

348
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,840
of the system and of what you can do

349
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,220
at the moment

350
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,340
the software is all a  euro clear that

351
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,789
we are still on the road but this is the

352
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:17,870
situation in the dive  nire

353
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,279
this is the situation in 2018 in which

354
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,620
there is no hardware manufacturer that

355
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,279
truly believes in a totally

356
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:29,990
free system totally based on

357
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,570
linux things can change I trust a

358
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,290
lot in purism but purism in this

359
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,710
book tourism sorry is encountering

360
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,290
several difficulties because an account  is to

361
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,930
make a nice program and collect 2

362
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,790
million dollars as they did

363
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,640
to finance stefano an account then

364
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,240
go to all Chinese producers and

365
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,540
convince them that the hardware you want to

366
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,850
use is totally free that the

367
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,610
software that must run on it must

368
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,390
be free  and so at this moment

369
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,370
we are still on the road

370
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,430
we hope to get to where

371
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,810
we want to go soon that is a

372
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:17,210
totally free system other things other things

373
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,970
besides the canonical ubuntu thatcher system

374
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,700
last year also dropped

375
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,210
another thing that this magnificent

376
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,400
system that  it's called unity 8 which is

377
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,520
a graphical interface that had the gift

378
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,190
of convergence women of

379
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,250
convergence  it is this magic that

380
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,050
I have seen it live

381
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,210
I do not know if you have had the opportunity to

382
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,490
experience this this fantastic thing

383
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,750


384
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,240
the possibility of using the same

385
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,590
system on the mobile phone and on the pc those of

386
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,450
you who have tried convergence no one

387
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,030
I imagine you can also try it  now

388
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,360
if you have a phone the nexus 4 or the

389
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,240
nexus 5 you can also try it at

390
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,320
home

391
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,360
practically the phone attached via

392
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,810
usb and with a monitor change the mode

393
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,440
of being vertical noda portray

394
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,460
talent skype and the interface becomes a

395
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,710
typical interface of a  desktop so

396
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,750
if you have a bluetooth mouse and a

397
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,970
bluetooth keyboard you can use it as

398
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,400
if it were a pc you can use a

399
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,490
mobile phone as if it were a clear pc the

400
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,850
performance depends on the

401
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,840
mobile phone however on a nexus 4 unity 8

402
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,590
this project was running well which has been

403
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,470
abandoned by the rectory  and now brought

404
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,049
forward again by uv clear forces

405
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:45,380
we are also there

406
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,000
and a constrained ie a lack of

407
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,030
resources because why people ch  and they

408
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,710
carry on a project they also bring

409
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,000
the other one so at this moment

410
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,090
there is a shortage of developers that we

411
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,330
hope will increase from a little to a time

412
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,810
that is not the shortage will

413
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,280
increase but the number of

414
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,980
developers will increase that

415
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,660
by  few developers who now can be

416
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,820
counted on the fingers of two hands

417
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,760
at least double within six months

418
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,610
a year it is clear that to carry out a

419
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,830
graphic gesture of this kind you need

420
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,720
a lot of people this is the

421
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,360
magic I was talking about before this

422
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,610
phone here  in this case you see it

423
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,840
there is this works here it is here this

424
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,380
here an ex 5 is this here is the nexus 5

425
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,680
there is this is not a pc connected to a

426
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,470
monitor but the nexus 5 that works like

427
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,660
a pc you see them there is the  bluetooth mouse and it

428
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,070
looks gigantic and this is a

429
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,970
keyboard these things work you can

430
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,440
surf the web write documents

431
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,120
read mail

432
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,280
all this up to now

433
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,940
has been made possible thanks to

434
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,060
I have to give words to the main spon  sor main

435
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,520
sponsor this dutch company is

436
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,160
called smooth is a ridiculously

437
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,250
small company compared to what canonical

438
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:27,020
because 30 40 employees of which 3

439
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,960
4 of these people are hired to

440
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,960
also deal with ubuntu touch so

441
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,540
there are currently 34 people

442
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,230
I say  34 because some on a part-time job

443
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,420
who offer themselves in their work of ubuntu

444
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,800
touch which is not cheap

445
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,440
with a company of 30 people this is the

446
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,260
person this gentleman here is called

447
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:54,020
giaron box is the ceo of this company

448
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:59,330
as well as founder and he who knowing

449
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,830
having heard of the development of throwing us

450
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,070
on one plus one, he contacted marius

451
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,870
grips card and told him but why

452
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,150
don't you make a version of ubuntu he is also silent

453
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,190
for shell phones that I

454
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,680
bought fashion because I strongly believe in

455
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,340
the ethical principles of this company that between

456
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,029
the other is also Dutch like as

457
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:25,269
smooth but he managed he told him ok I

458
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:28,509
do it now and I do it immediately this moment has been

459
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:30,820
postponed from time to

460
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,729
time ubuntu touch on f  ashion works

461
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:37,299
but not very well however he is still a

462
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:39,969
very enthusiastic person in the project

463
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:43,840
and therefore he devotes many parts of his

464
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,869
energy and also of his money he buys

465
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:49,330
to this project

466
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,789
obviously he does not want to be a

467
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:53,919
corporate project because he does not want is not to the

468
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,559
capacity not to the  resources to take

469
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,379
charge of a project of this magnitude

470
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:01,989
and that is why the idea

471
00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:07,359
of becoming an ubuntu foundation was born for those

472
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,519
interested you can easily

473
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,559
start contributing this is

474
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:20,139
our website is called youporn.com you can

475
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:23,349
find them a  po all the roles sought

476
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:25,019
obviously being an

477
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:27,580
extremely small community that is extremely in

478
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,399
need of any type of profile

479
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:33,129
so if you want to do documentation

480
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:36,489
programming translations disclosures

481
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:38,499
like myself going around

482
00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:39,779
talking about things

483
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,729
you can join there is a way to fill in

484
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:45,369
you can enter  in contact via

485
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:50,469
especially telegram our forum

486
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:52,419
and then at any time you can

487
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:55,269
ask me  ok if you also want a

488
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:57,779
human contact

489
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:03,250
point you need a little bit all the profiles

490
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,930
are more or less technical

491
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,120
the project is a project that is

492
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,780
being born but let's say our idea

493
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,870
is our enthusiasm and what can be

494
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,600
done

495
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,850
the question to  which I find myself most often

496
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:25,650
answering on ubuntu touch and it's that but

497
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,080
hell but it wasn't abandoned by the

498
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,990
canonical moon ago it's still alive and I have to

499
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,820
say yes that's alive

500
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,700
we are still carrying out projects

501
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,620
so right now there is a huge

502
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,510
effort we are making to

503
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,790
gain some visibility and this is one of the

504
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,680
reasons why I am here and there is a huge

505
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,570
need to grow a community that is

506
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:51,720
extremely small that you count a

507
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,230
name it means how many are few ok

508
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,880
you can get in touch  point on

509
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,670
telegrams on the forums you can also go

510
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,910
to the site there are the officially supported devices

511
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,450
if there are in mode to

512
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,040
try installing ubuntu thatcher on the

513
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,350
devices officially there is a program

514
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,680
that runs both  on windows and on linux as well as

515
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,520
on mac even with which you can

516
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,310
flash that is to install ubuntu keep quiet

517
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,040
on official devices you just have to

518
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,470
try I throw the stone let's see

519
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,910
if someone collects well I'm done

520
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,660
if you have any questions

521
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:50,479
[Applause]

522
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:55,080
no questions all clear well  for

523
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:05,190
fetishists a nexus 5 order of magnitude

524
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,879
how much does it cost in euros how much does

525
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:14,399
a nexus 5 cost to a former 5 pro vita and 80 70 80

526
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,940
euro and 100 euro used immediately seasoned with

527
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:25,769
two beautiful plot but after one sky

528
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:32,960
ion a mx4 that a  this here that at 32 gb

529
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,259
of memory and 3 gb of ram and an opta horns it

530
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:40,710
seems then I will show you again a

531
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,070
good phone even the fair phone at a

532
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,399
32 giga and 3 gb of ram is a good phone

533
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,440
but it costs a lot

534
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,570
you can find it  still on the market, my

535
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,029
opinion, it costs a lot because when you

536
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:56,789
buy a 100 euro Chinese mobile phone

537
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:57,239


538
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:59,759
you must know that the difference in

539
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:02,539
price you pay between what

540
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:05,190
that phone is actually worth and how much you

541
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:10,279
pay for it is all the ethics that we ignore  or

542
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:13,470
i don't know if i got the idea if you want to

543
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,869
exploit a chinese worker as

544
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:18,239
we exploit him for anything that is

545
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:20,789
a t shirt and a pair of jeans and underpaid him they

546
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:23,049
work seven

547
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:26,200
sorry seven days a week for 24

548
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,919
hours

549
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:29,289
and clear that that person there  his

550
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:31,629
salary is a euro that you save on the

551
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:34,659
phone if, however, you pay a

552
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:36,700
fair salary to a worker who is

553
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,559
Chinese from any other part of the

554
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,429
world

555
00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:42,009
that place you have to pay then in the

556
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:44,679
things you buy so scelfo has

557
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:47,409
decided not to hide not to

558
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:51,419
charge this  cost to society

559
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,039
that both pollution and

560
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:56,529
exploited workers and pours it on the phone

561
00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:59,919
then a fair phone two seems to cost 599

562
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:07,350
euros to give the idea question the iphone

563
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:14,080
was a happy owner of a samsung

564
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,480
galaxy nexus that supported ubuntu touch

565
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,960
and then the  I had propitiated and to date I was

566
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,330
wondering I had also dubbed the

567
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,489
replicant project that wants to make an

568
00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:26,799
android version is completely free and I saw

569
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,989
that their main problem  It was important to

570
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:32,340
separate the proprietary interface between kernel space and user space

571
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,499
to

572
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:38,019
connect late on the phone

573
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:39,820
you have encountered big problems of

574
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,139
this type separate or find

575
00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:46,330
a free alternative for the

576
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:50,080
radio interface or how the project status on

577
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,690
this is obvious you don't  I can say but I

578
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,059
can inform myself if you then give me the

579
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,399
address I will write to you but what

580
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:00,009
technical details thanks I am not a

581
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:01,749
programmer in the sense I am not a

582
00:30:01,749 --> 00:30:03,629
programmer who programs phones

583
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:07,450
so I am more on the marketing side

584
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,950
because it seems that the two

585
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,520
profiles

586
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,070
are  antithetical who goes around

587
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,470
talking below has poor

588
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,260
technical skills and vice versa

589
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,030
then at the bottom I see exceptions

590
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,760
but they are exceptions that usually in

591
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,250
the university but I count if you give me

592
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:33,680
your details then I write to you I'm

593
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,530
finished I know  that the time is up too

594
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,970
so if you have any questions,

595
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,160
anyway I stay around here

596
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,550
you can ask me anything as I

597
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,650
said is there any  gadgets for those who are

598
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,800
passionate I don't know where to put them because it

599
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,630
doesn't seem like the place here but maybe

600
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:55,390
leave a little bit around that thank you very much

601
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:01,259
[Applause]
