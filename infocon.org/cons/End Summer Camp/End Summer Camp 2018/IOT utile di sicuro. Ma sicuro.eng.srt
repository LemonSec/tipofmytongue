1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
hello everyone my name is igor

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,060
falcomatà i'm someone who in Italian

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,069
sounds a bit bad a penetration test air

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,590
so i'm someone who does

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,780
attack simulations obviously in a

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,639
controlled environment in a controlled environment and

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,460
that is the important thing to check

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,340
the safety level of  network

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,380
applications systems infrastructures

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,939
etcetera etcetera

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,449
according to a very old motto that exists

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:28,890
like many places born in

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,650
cyber security which is try to break

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,739
into your system for next 2

15
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:36,239
try to break into your

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,480
systems before the attackers and

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,500
they really do I deal with

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,420
security  computer for some years

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,600
and among other things I am the founder of

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,969
security punto org which is one are

21
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,680
some mailing lists in particular

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,149
one called ml that deal with

23
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,350
computer security

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,570
when it was born in 98 it made sense

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,090
now perhaps with the forum with  internet

26
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,260
with all these things here a little less

27
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,049
sense but still some messages each

28
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,260
month every year passes I am active in the

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,090
various bz lug

30
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,330
r lug fluke it depends on where from cat

31
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,010
hat from where he resides at that

32
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,310
moment but at the end of the fair we will talk

33
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,820
today about aid and security aid

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,939
especially first of all very

35
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:24,720
fast since we have little time

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,640
what  I already know it to you I am not going to

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,369
explain it to you are all those things that

38
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,470
we increasingly put at home

39
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,850
from our refrigerator to our

40
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,159
television to our smartphone at the

41
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,689
end of the fair that is also an

42
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,030
object for good or bad that to do with

43
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,659
the iotti according to all the statistics to

44
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,820
an exponential growth it is estimated that

45
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,100
there will be c that there are already 20

46
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,689
billion devices more or less

47
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,490
connected in some way directly

48
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,710
or indirectly to the internet and that these

49
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,470
will reach 50 billion

50
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,520
2020 or so when  we

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,720
talk about garlic tisi

52
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,580
basically talks about anything

53
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,520
that uses ip technology and talks

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,190
to a command center directly with

55
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,169
others  objects and things of this kind

56
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,530
ok so much so that the most used term is

57
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,130
internet things the internet of things but

58
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,320
we also talk about the internet of every

59
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,900
thing or the internet of machines or

60
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,660
even a machine to machine that

61
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,700
when we talk about objects that  between

62
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,830
them in mesh networks or similar they

63
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,830
exchange information and make

64
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,410
decisions about things to do based on

65
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,330
a pseudo-artificial intelligence or

66
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,360
so on the internet or fas you have heard it

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,459
internet of server security skynet

68
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:53,730
internet of [ __ ] is a beautiful account

69
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,500
on twitter  where all

70
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,720
the failures of all these objects

71
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,420
connected directly to the internet are collected,

72
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,980
especially if we go and see if

73
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,600
we go and see when I made these

74
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,120
slides it was the period in which I

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,190
do not know if you remember alexa which is

76
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,530
the objective that did  amazon to

77
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,989
have at home something you can say to

78
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:17,940
order mini fries or

79
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,890
order spare panties and so

80
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,900
on here there was a period some

81
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,269
six me  yes it seems to me in which device alex

82
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:25,769
have begun to make some

83
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:28,799
satanic laughter seriously i'm kidding

84
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,830
ok so even the terminology is

85
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,680
very confusing ok what the hell does it mean

86
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,600
all this stuff the two ems etcetera

87
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,700
etcetera at the end of the fair

88
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,299
we are talking about objects objects that

89
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,790
they talk to other objects via the net

90
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,060
usually ip network ok that can be of

91
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,840
any type

92
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,610
this definition these slides you

93
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,599
see stolen here or stolen from

94
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,579
a talk I did with marco calamari

95
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,970
in a cassandra computer point

96
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,760
so that he knew him at an event that is

97
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,110
very interesting that it is called and

98
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,030
privacy which is held once or twice a

99
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,980
year where we talk about the law of

100
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,930
new technologies or privacy or

101
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,339
things of this kind,

102
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,259
big brother awards are also assigned to those

103
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,539
companies that have distinguished themselves in

104
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:23,220
quotation marks for  being particularly

105
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,800
little interested in our privacy or

106
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,479
vice versa too interested does not know

107
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,350
privacy more than it will be  had

108
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,740
legitimate use and users

109
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,750
of aids this interesting here now

110
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,710
we have done the introductory part

111
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,660
this part here instead start to

112
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,789
put a bit of brain

113
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:44,539
if you search internet of things on google

114
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:47,539
you will find few results

115
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:51,240
40 million results but what

116
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,889
interests me is that  what interests me

117
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:55,500
is the user more than the use i.e.

118
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,229
what can I do with the hot i everything what

119
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:00,870
i am interested in doing what is mine what

120
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,729
is your relationship my relationship with

121
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:05,160
the help try to think about it do not

122
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,020
use aids c  'is someone who does not

123
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,860
use me here this is already a

124
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,260
good good thing

125
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,389
we are talking about consumers private users

126
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,250
that all those who have the feed bit

127
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,409
the mobile phone we are talking about business users also

128
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:21,330
begins to talk about industrial

129
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,909
ouch ouch ouch ouch then the internet

130
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,620
about things in the industrial sector things of

131
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,539
this kind

132
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,280
we talk about resellers we talk about things

133
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,440
of this kind I am interested

134
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,479
especially if there is some developer

135
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,909
of aid because the security part

136
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,620
must begin to implement it

137
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,470
mainly they therefore ascertained

138
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,479
that your use of aid

139
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,520
is none because no one by now in

140
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,440
2018 can think of not having to do

141
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,870
with lyautey at most if he thinks he

142
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,099
has not made records  of not having to do

143
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,770
with lyautey is a passive user of

144
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,169
aid but lyautey is now there because in

145
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:57,060
your car it probably will

146
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,159
be if it is not already in your TV it is

147
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,139
in your telephone and very soon it will

148
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,820
also be in your boiler and already in the

149
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,949
your light meters

150
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:07,169
etcetera etcetera and in your traffic lights

151
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,900
under the house the cities begin to make a

152
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,110
lot of use of

153
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,820
aids as regards the

154
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,900
parking sensors sensors of the viron while things

155
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,860
of this kind victim of aid an

156
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,780
interesting thing the miniaturization

157
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,420
of these objects allows  also to do

158
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,360
some very unpleasant things that are legal

159
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,700
in quotes so it was interception

160
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,710
etcetera but also illegal  there if I want to

161
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,900
make a gps locator to put

162
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,760
under the car I drive now I

163
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,040
do it with a big deal so of an

164
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,210
attack under the car from a

165
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,680
battery and if he does not go to look

166
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,690
for it expressly he will never find it or

167
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,730
I can take a router in a  raspberry

168
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:50,320
one of these mini appliances with

169
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,540
wright here with battery put it in

170
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,950
your office on a network port

171
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,380
have an access to your

172
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,090
company network without you leaving with

173
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,490
you realizing it up to

174
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,560
what I think is perfect even

175
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,880
if  in reality there will be a lot of time

176
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,340
for if tomorrow I were to design a

177
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,680
backdoor to an object a trojan that

178
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,050
is on someone's network I would put it

179
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,510
in the firmware of a printer

180
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,830
you know how printers work

181
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,540
in a business environment now you usually

182
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,430
go to a supplier  buy a

183
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,540
contract make a contract it's called

184
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,400
cost copy where he brings you the

185
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,560
printers sails he attacks you don't know

186
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,210
anything about those printers  and for three years they

187
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,580
are there the easystel installation to them

188
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,140
the possible maintenance to them

189
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,820
etc.

190
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,170
have you ever seen if you have never seen it

191
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,970
search it on google there are people

192
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,800
running doom on the hp

193
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,560
laserjet color display ok then signing of the

194
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,480
printers is a particularly

195
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,580
malleable object interesting for those who want to

196
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,830
make these objects is a business that

197
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,180
is in your network over which you

198
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,700
have no control and that can

199
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,560
do funny things but it is not

200
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,060
what interests us today so

201
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,710
I gave it to you  just as a starting point alioti and

202
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:03,130
security this I could not put it

203
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,590
this is a twitter ad so tweeted and

204
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,330
refused to whom it is not known that he can no

205
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,540
longer give the shaun tribe the s in aid

206
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,650
stands for safety

207
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:17,710
where the essen aid is not there  it is

208
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,930
another article not from yesterday not the day before yesterday

209
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,160
but if I remember correctly 2013

210
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,860
is not films mor light internet of five

211
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,860
actors the internet of things but more than

212
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,840
anything else the internet of attack vectors

213
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,550


214
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,549
see  Let's a little bit about the technology that makes up

215
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:38,080
this whole bubble called aid

216
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,750
then lyautey is made up of

217
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,270
some new interesting stuff made

218
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,670
especially for the iotti but in reality at the

219
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,260
end of the fair there is a lot of

220
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,300
technology already super known so

221
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,750
web  Mobile 2.0 that you love already has

222
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,630
rpc servers and things like that there is a little

223
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,030
bit of technology in bad the

224
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,040
legacy in the sense that some of the movies

225
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,690
some of the operating systems that are used

226
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,690
in the field of hot in reality were already used

227
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,650
simply not you  they were calling help

228
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,360
we think of vx workshop we think of

229
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,670
operating systems of this kind up

230
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,830
to the point of reaching even pieces

231
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,570
of things that are very much in the

232
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,320
scada field p you know what scada are the

233
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
control systems and

234
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,760
data collection systems in the industrial sector ok

235
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,620
those  that in the factories they

236
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,770
make the machines, the refrigerators, the

237
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,740
iron poles and so on

238
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,140
there are many differences between I

239
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,390
escada but there are also some analogies

240
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,660
ok we will try  even here to mention a

241
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,930
few to tell to outline some

242
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,480
differences and similarities in particular

243
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,670
now slowly

244
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,470
this stuff which is called io

245
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,230
ti industrial internet of things begins to spread, i.e.

246
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,200
the use of technology helps in the industrial field

247
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,430


248
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,980
the first big difference between  lyautey

249
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,380
and objects in cs scada areas is that

250
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,240
usually the aids are engineered

251
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,250
time to market therefore quickly and

252
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,930
forgive latinism often ad

253
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,000
kazum while in theory in the industrial sector it

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,580
is one of the few things that they care a

255
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,970
lot about is the quantity and we say

256
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,100
it  ability of the object to withstand

257
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,140
wear and tear to withstand a whole

258
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,880
situation then security is horrifying

259
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,030
even in the cs field but at least

260
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,800
the engineering field the

261
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,500
quality field is usually much more taken care of

262
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,050
the extra one in

263
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,700
all it is hoped that  both because they want to

264
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,990
apply the production processes of the

265
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,730
cs scope to the objects aids to

266
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,630
be put in the factory network because

267
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,899
this  stuff here has problems the first

268
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:49,240
reason is simply a matter of

269
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,140
line of code

270
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,240
I don't know if you know if the

271
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,829
security jobs anyway of

272
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:55,269
software engineering probably have told you

273
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:58,750
but there is a direct relationship to the number of

274
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,200
lines of code  totti errors in the code

275
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,519
mathematics is not true statistics it

276
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,959
cannot be done and it cannot be ignored

277
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,920


278
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,390
let's say that every thousand lines of code

279
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,910
there is an error of these errors every

280
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,370
thousand lines of code that one out of ten

281
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,990
of these errors has an impact  direct

282
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,940
indirect on cyber security

283
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,220
ok so doing one plus one plus one the

284
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,010
more there are lines of code and the more

285
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,200
likely there is an error in these

286
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,910
lines of the code and the more

287
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,200
likely one of these errors is to impact

288
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,110
cyber security

289
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,630
here  there are a couple of examples

290
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,820
we went to the moon with less than

291
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,810
10 thousand lines of code a pacemaker at

292
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,110
about 100 thousand lines of code as well as

293
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,480
photoshop 1.0 when it came out  to

294
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,250
now photoshop the linux kernel is over 3 and a

295
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,020
half million lines of code

296
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,180
and it is interesting to

297
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,910
oh well 65 million lines of code

298
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,680
including applications let's say in

299
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,820
the basic package of a

300
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,610
distribution eni so debian a bit old ok

301
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,399
windows xp  and windows xp compared to

302
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,500
windows 31 we are talking about 43 million

303
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,880
lines of code compared to 2 million

304
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,970
lines of code and then oh well also the one

305
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,620
on the f35 f 22 and boeing 787 etc.

306
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,620
other example non-industrial

307
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,279
machine machine of the modern era that 50

308
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,029
million  of lines of code

309
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,760
what is the problem that thousands or

310
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,850
millions of lines of code together with

311
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,279
inexpensive objects why the typical

312
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,019
help object must be little expensive

313
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:35,949
think about the feedback

314
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:37,779
how much can a bracelet cost

315
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:40,779
that reveals the beats ok and that has a loop

316
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:42,490
of life a time to market that must

317
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,959
be very fast because if I have

318
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:44,620
teeth

319
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,420
we make a bracelet that detects the

320
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,640
beats nice idea but how many

321
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,500
will have had it in the world and that  moment

322
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,210
so once I have the idea I have to

323
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,760
realize it in the shortest time

324
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,330


325
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,950
possible plus a lot of this stuff uses the c

326
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,600
which in itself is not a problem if it is

327
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,090
done well but has notoriously for those who do

328
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,670
computer engineering will know I love it

329
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,500
notoriously

330
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,240
memory management problems that are much

331
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,590
more delicate than those of other

332
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,850
languages that are called scripting,

333
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,920
however, more of a higher level

334
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,470
so put this thing together

335
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,120
millions of lines of code objects

336
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,530
developed as quickly as possible

337
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,740
that must be cheap with a  time to

338
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,530
market very low script up what

339
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,860
can ever go wrong so

340
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,540
the problem is that there is too much

341
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,510
software for sure it is a problem but it

342
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,580
must be managed with software hungary with

343
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,740
a good quality of the software

344
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,690
the problem is not that there is  it's just too much

345
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,950
software the problem is that there is too much

346
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,320
software written forgive again

347
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,410
latinism to ad [ __ ] that is a lot of software

348
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,760
written quickly or without the ops

349
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,230
some software security guidelines

350
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,490
things like

351
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,990
this this is a bit for what we

352
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,970
said before a bit also because often

353
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,610
rightly in this

354
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,730
business model who writes an application is the

355
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,100
firmware of an object of this business

356
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,080
here often is a  new graduate or

357
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,510
even with a start-up of people

358
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,550
who have put themselves there and do this thing here

359
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,290
not that the new graduate cannot

360
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,750
write the beautiful code but one by

361
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,730
one let's say the experience having lived

362
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,640
a series of situations usually helps

363
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,190
to have a more defensive approach a

364
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,660
more defensive mentality in fact it is very

365
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,460
important it must go very well what

366
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,630
is happening now that is that

367
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,850
in the university there is more and more talk

368
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,580
about the quality of software engineering security

369
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,170
of things of this kind

370
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,490
I remember  when I didn't go

371
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,240
to university

372
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,840
so we're talking about 97 98

373
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,370
I didn't see one of the various

374
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,630
reasons the other that there is no desire to

375
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,100
study one but one of the m  reasons why

376
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,450
I did not go to university and that I

377
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,790
was already interested in cyber security

378
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,440
and on a five-year degree course

379
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,550
the cybersecurity program

380
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,370
was like three days now

381
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,300
luckily things

382
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,760
have changed a lot I think of polimi I think of

383
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,760
cream I also think of  venezia padova the

384
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,560
whole series of maybe someone from here there is

385
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,500
also various in groups of the various

386
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,089
diversities that are asserting

387
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:10,380
themselves around the world

388
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,730
we talk about the micro hardware that is the

389
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,790
long hardware of the business ni ok

390
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,740
then the hardware  of these in farini the

391
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,360
first problem that knows that these in

392
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,430
farini have a hardware

393
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,800
that is often not designed to run

394
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,420
a multi-user multi-use operating system

395
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,570
and with protections so they have a

396
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,920
flat memory management

397
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,290
ok if I can write  the memory

398
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,130
is not

399
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,839
a difference that ernst and user especially

400
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:37,290
there is a single software that runs if I

401
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,690
abuse some of the inputs of that

402
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,519
software to go for an over fl  ow

403
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,529
to overwrite they are directly in

404
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:47,410
memory very often they do not have those

405
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,209
security measures that the

406
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:52,209
server and client devices have we now use

407
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:55,660
so the impossibility of executing

408
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,480
code in the detachment things of this

409
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:58,930
kind

410
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,970
ok they do not even have the ring in the cpu

411
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,500
so they do not have a differentiation

412
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,589
between kernel and user space not all some

413
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,750
yes some no and even here often

414
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,029
especially in the smaller micro business

415
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:12,970
are everything is always written

416
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,709
in c so with all the problems

417
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,540
that this entails for the part of

418
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,800
memory mag ing etc. etc.

419
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,880
this is  the objective then the

420
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,589
bracelet and so on the

421
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:25,839
next step is often the controller and

422
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,980
so an embedded operating system

423
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,200
we think of the router the camera

424
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,660
we think of a sensor that collects here

425
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,790
that collects all the data of our

426
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,290
bracelets because maybe there is a

427
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,360
system of  tracking or things like that

428
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,020


429
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,070
ok very often the us operating systems

430
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,770
are 10 12 of these objects  15

431
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,180
years behind what are

432
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,220
the protection technologies of a

433
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,920
windows or linux machine or what is

434
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,230
current so they do not have what

435
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,880
are called anti

436
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,310
exploiting techniques are very very trivial but

437
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,620
I already did a talk in 2010

438
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,630
talking about  android security in

439
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,220
2000

440
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,530
10 android was at the level of this

441
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,240
business here there was no kind

442
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,609
of anti exploitation technique and

443
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:11,819
things like that very often then the

444
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,310
techniques to attack the

445
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,990
communication interfaces

446
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,910
of the management maintenance interfaces of

447
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,980
these deals are very trivial

448
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,930
common techniques telnet compass by default or in

449
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,780
any case tel net http with

450
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,710
common vulnerabilities step by default

451
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,090
network communications based on traffic i

452
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,800
declare things of this kind and

453
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,520
api web based interfaces what

454
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,830
can ever go wrong

455
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,090
this we do it very quickly

456
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,360
this  is a comparison table

457
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,950
on the site of a project

458
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,230
called hartnett di as  i know if

459
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,360
anyone knows it is basically

460
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,610
a version of freebsd that some guys

461
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,480
are patching

462
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,310
kernel level anti exploiting and

463
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,970
stuff like that

464
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,280
this comparison table takes

465
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,650
arden airgest of freebsd open vs net

466
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,900
bsd and shows  all the various techniques

467
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,610
now we do not go into detail

468
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,920
and says who has them by default and who does

469
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,360
not have them

470
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,490
if you take linos you will probably find

471
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,430
only these three

472
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:18,770
I looked up to here because I am talking about linux

473
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,480
if this slide does not talk about linus

474
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,010
you know it  what is the

475
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,230
most used operating system in the field hot i am bad

476
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,240
etc.

477
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,870
good he is that this is an

478
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,670
article even a bit controversial for charity

479
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,680
published in the washington post so not

480
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,420
in the grandmother's gazette and not in a

481
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,530
specialized magazine in 2015 that

482
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,540
spoke  about the security problems

483
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,180
of the linux kernel

484
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,620
you will say but linux has been operating

485
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,600
very safe everyone knows it is better than

486
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,050
windows

487
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,470
no at the kernel design level

488
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,300
of antic sporting measures in the

489
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,700
linux kernel unfortunately linux is

490
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,470
lagging far behind all

491
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,210
the other commonly used operating systems

492
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,260
so windows mac way six

493
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,790
the only one on which we probably still

494
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,500
say better features than

495
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,780
and freebsd all the others that in the

496
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,580
general purpose operating systems

497
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,550
have much better functionality and mechanisms of

498
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,440
antec top team than

499
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,670
those of the linux kernel

500
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,920
so much so that now there is a project

501
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,800
called curling the kernel garden inn

502
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,320
project that wants to back

503
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,570
port  a whole series of security patches

504
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,990
made by the gr security project to apax

505
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,310
inside the kernel john harbor post with

506
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,870
a whole cinema behind him

507
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,480
we are not interested in entering but keep in

508
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,310
mind that the linux kernel in the

509
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,920
state of affairs especially as we say

510
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,710
compiled by default in

511
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,720
embedded objects and in objects say ai in

512
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,280
servers in workstations is

513
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,040
probably not kerned  and now with the

514
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,640
best state of the art

515
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,590
another very important thing to

516
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,780
evaluate when it comes to the internet of

517
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,040
things is this the internet of things to

518
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,130
face that is to one account and update 10

519
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,350
servers 20 servers one thousand servers 100 thousand

520
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:06,890
servers

521
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,930
one account  and update a billion

522
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,400
parking sensors around the

523
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,660
world

524
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,460
if each of these deals has a

525
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,890
small signature that has a vulnerability and

526
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,630
I put one in each

527
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,490
parking sensor of an entire parking lot for

528
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,410
a city for a continent for the  world

529
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,730
ok

530
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,590
the idea of having to go and do the

531
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,410
reasoning of those affairs is

532
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,630
complicated not to mention that maybe they

533
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,210
are not updateable there are objects

534
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,550
that are not updateable or are

535
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,220
only updateable own site

536
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,510
then we will have new slaves that

537
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,760
go around take the same restart  the

538
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,430
sensor attaches it usb press a

539
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,770
key they hang it up a good job

540
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,800
ok so an important thing when

541
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,920
evaluating an aid speech is a

542
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,720
good level in the meantime  security by default but

543
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,340
also the possibility of having a

544
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,840
management of

545
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,490
firmware updates etc. that is

546
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,130
substantially interesting

547
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,680
up to the case and this too

548
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,240
is not really help in the classic sense but

549
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,290
think about

550
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,200
those of you who have a cellphone anyone who

551
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,280
of you has one  smartphone

552
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,440
anyone who of you with the latest version

553
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,520
of the firmware

554
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,580
released by google on android or by

555
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,360
apple on his who instead has a version

556
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,130
that is no longer supported not if it is not

557
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,510
that you raise your hand obviously it was a

558
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,780
rhetorical question but they are raised your

559
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,120
hand  been that the concept is that that is

560
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,770
there are a lot of objects that it is no

561
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,450
longer convenient to update because I

562
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,500
am going to pull some trouble

563
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,600
I am vodafone I mean I have

564
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,010
sold a million phones that

565
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,840
work because I have to go and

566
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,780
engineer the update patch

567
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,440
distribute it  on a million phones

568
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,000
that then maybe it doesn't work and on a

569
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,350
million customers who get pissed

570
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,590
instead leave it like that  as it is until it is

571
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,660
the end user who is a consumer or

572
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,910
business who asks the manufacturer to the

573
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,980
supplier to give him an updated device i

574
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,440
will have this problem

575
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,480
this in the same yautja there are a

576
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,620
lot of objects that are abandoned

577
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,270
we do an interesting key study not

578
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,290
everyone knows

579
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,750
that league rabbit and the beast there in the

580
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,760
upper right the with the upper right you

581
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,800
know it is a hideous plastic rabbit

582
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,380
that moves its ears makes

583
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,570
sounds of voices is called

584
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,410
nabaztag ok is produced in any case in

585
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,870
over 100,000 copies and in the  2005 was

586
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,090
a considerable number for an object extra

587
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,100
help is precisely the paradigm of the aio

588
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:36,630
team you don't need a [ __ ] the joke is by

589
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,340
marco calamari this always of the slides

590
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,360
that my rabbit made me together

591
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,740
is the only thing in computer science

592
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,540
that in  30 years of living together

593
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,760
made me make a good impression with his

594
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,090
wife

595
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,340
ok because precisely morea the ears

596
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,140
said sweet things are programmed and

597
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,130
things of this gen

598
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,630
This was to show how much we are

599
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,600
esteemed and recognized in the world to a

600
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,430
button on the head two ears with

601
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,650
multicolored LED motors a ray

602
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,870
feed reader but above all to a firmware is a

603
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,240
wifi card and was controlled by a

604
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,330
remote server that was used to make

605
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,130
the  to send him commands then the

606
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,930
batak nose connects to a server

607
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,760
I connect to the server send commands

608
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,290
arrive at the

609
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,760
nasdaq this is also interesting from the point of view of

610
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,770
me because it is the iotti paradigm it

611
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,300
is almost always like this

612
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,430
that is it is difficult for you to have an

613
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,350
object  help that has commanded

614
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,289
directly from you often the object

615
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:27,809
help well you stay a meter from you go to the

616
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:32,130
cloud in the cloud here he gets things said he

617
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,919
sends things what can never

618
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,580
go wrong here is the protocol of the

619
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,710
nasdaq and interesting to do a talk

620
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,539
to the  flight that is dedicated tribute half an hour

621
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,190
we did a minimum of reversing of

622
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,820
white shark and looked at what it does

623
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,370
uses the protocol of an already mpp sedan

624
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,780
then choice intelli  people also for

625
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,960
the time that was basically encrypted

626
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,900
in that case behind encrypted with tls ok

627
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,630
but then in reality when they get

628
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,730
mp3 blobs to play

629
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,169
etc. these instead are

630
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:05,580
transferred with normal

631
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,159
http requests from the rabbit that  it was a gap

632
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,070
on the server and so on

633
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,010
ok so the two interesting things are

634
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,140
that you use the tls so it uses an

635
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,970
encrypted protocol for the

636
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,429
communication channel of the commands but it does not

637
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:23,490
verify certificates so you can do

638
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,960
man in the middle you can

639
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,220
play the  two certain films of the three

640
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,740
certificates he is connecting to

641
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,110
the xmpp server a jabra server to which he wants to

642
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,330
connect I intercept the

643
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,530
direct traffic and give

644
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,929
him any certificate he takes it for granted and I

645
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:38,730
do it myself baby doll simply

646
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,549
using the xmpp protocol or better

647
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:44,490
still  when he downloads mp3 to say

648
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,620
hi love i love you i

649
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,169
replace mp3 on the fly and

650
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:51,870
saying your rabbit has been caught pays

651
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:56,789
a bitcoin if  you want to get it back ok so it goes

652
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:58,620
well here there is the attack we are not doing it

653
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,840
but it is done with hard spuches with burt and with

654
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,909
these things here what I just

655
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:05,429
told you then encrypted command traffic

656
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:07,770
but does not verify the certificates

657
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,929
traffic of the contents in  clear therefore

658
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:12,299
directly interceptible use of

659
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,679
resources in the club so there is a whole

660
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,539
channel miss fund the central nas kotak server

661
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:17,400
against the

662
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,570
world tag jumpsuit ok

663
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,760
in addition it is also an orphan in the sense that the

664
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,350
company in the meantime has gone bankrupt has been

665
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,000
sold re bankrupt not  nobody cares anymore

666
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,320
so the nose but pays is a

667
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,870
discontinuous object no longer exists there

668
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,059
are amateur servers but it is a

669
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,370
classic even here in the yacht

670
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,590
if the business model does not work

671
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,540
I still fail I close the project

672
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,410
I find myself with 100 thousand dead rabbits

673
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,660
you will say oh well design of 2005 that

674
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,030
the studies you show us are in 2018

675
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,550
tell us something more interesting is

676
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:50,750
fine in 2018 better actually in 2006

677
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,720
that is the article of 2  018 but a

678
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,640
search was done in 2016 which is called

679
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,130
aid and security on three places and one of

680
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,320
these various cybersecurity news sites

681
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,850
this and that I think is

682
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,010
sponsored by kaspersky but every

683
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,910
friday antivirus siena 1 ok aid to

684
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,070
pin nerds  points in the problems

685
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,679
guess what they found

686
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:15,170
in 2016 these researchers looking at

687
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:21,110
many help objects have seen that ok 6

688
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,540
out of 10 devices have

689
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,580
a management interface that is vulnerable to

690
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,830
classic vulnerability i s injection

691
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,570
koman injection etc.

692
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,960
ok eighty per  one hundred devices

693
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,330
do not require the use of a password

694
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,160
of a certain strength complexity

695
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,929
so if I put foo foo as a

696
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:40,640
password in a b says the name of a

697
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,690
more robust password 70 percent of the

698
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,760
devices allow numbering

699
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,940
of valid users 70 for  one hundred

700
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,309
devices are using honey crypt network

701
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:55,040
services in 2016 70 percent so

702
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,320
that case of 2005 wasn't all that

703
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,590
isolated and po  oh well this is another

704
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,510
important thing especially for privacy

705
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,390
90 percent of devices collect dat

706
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,210
least one piece of personal information

707
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,910
via the device and sand to the cloud I

708
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,530
don't know if you have ever looked at the traffic that

709
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,420
an average android application makes or  the

710
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,190
average operating system sends a lot

711
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,559
of information about you who you are what your name is

712
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,270
penis length all

713
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,250
these things here to google servers

714
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,500
ok same stuff objects do help

715
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,110
there are also here an avalanche of cases the

716
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,240
most striking is that of this up  of

717
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,630
these dolls of these let's say

718
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,520
games toys for children that

719
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,560
had a mechanism to recognize the

720
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,140
voice speak take photographs everything

721
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,790
on a cloud server of the company

722
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:44,980
moreover it breaks through the bill and this object is not beautiful

723
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,390
here I do not know if you recognize

724
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,560
the shape I tell you the  name is called where

725
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,300
there was vibra tissimo that vibrates tissimo an

726
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,710
object to yachtique there is its

727
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,330
bluetooth interface its

728
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,420
companion cloud server eh  year found two

729
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,940
three vulnerabilities clubti wirth storage

730
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,890
password exposé from an institution

731
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,710
interface which is customer database

732
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,750
credential disclosure an authentic and

733
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,970
bluetooth el connection also this is

734
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:14,900
a classic

735
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,490
if you have devices that use bluetooth

736
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,780
and she who is a bluetooth version

737
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,880
made especially for lyautey that  uses little

738
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,300
energy even a little effort in

739
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,520
breaking it usually which is a whole

740
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,570
series of other things

741
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,270
you will say if I buy myself it vibrates very much I

742
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,800
would like my privacy to be a

743
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,860
minimum maintenance managed with the

744
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,350
correct measures in this case not here

745
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,470
but it is only to do  an example another

746
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,540
example if someone then wants to see

747
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,610
it a little faster it goes it happens more

748
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,680
complete go to the report site and look for

749
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,590
it is called I want to cry the episode

750
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,750
we took an epic but any

751
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,430
bought at the supermarket

752
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,970
ok brought home and we looked at that

753
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,740
what could be done with this epic but

754
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,110
above all what could be done with

755
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,180
this epic but without the knowledge of  a person

756
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,460
who installs val ip cam in his apartment in his

757
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,960
apartment you know what an ip camera is

758
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,030
a webcam that has the

759
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,000
tcp ip stack directly and talks to the internet

760
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,370
ok this is the very difficult and very

761
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,630
complex exploits necessary to

762
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,790
enter once you know the  'public ip address

763
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,130
that you find with sodano so

764
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,200
on in

765
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,900
the ip cam administration interface instead of doing get flash

766
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,780
login fi get login and he tells you the

767
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,820
password and the user the password set

768
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,430
at that moment this is a

769
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,430
2004 vulnerability published by

770
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,740
luigi  ariemma and that to date has not

771
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,240
been resolved that is this signature is not

772
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,890
from 2004 and 2015

773
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,000
from 16 2017 doing a further research

774
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,610
a French man is called pierre

775
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,320
something now I do not remember the name

776
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,520
pierre kim he too had taken a bit

777
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,130
let's say  various webcams and found that

778
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,810
basically there must be more or

779
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,490
less a single film producer of

780
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,740
this webcam that was sold to 800

781
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,510
million different producers

782
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,440
ta  nt is that according to him there were even

783
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,080
1250 camera models so 1250

784
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,640
different models that have the same firmware at the end of the fair

785
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,530
which must

786
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,770
also be a firmware made burnell

787
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,660
forget in the sense that it is released

788
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,310
there are no updates etc. that is

789
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,110
every time they stop

790
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,610
maybe make some changes throw

791
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,730
something in but then bye thanks goodbye

792
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,860
and in this film there was an avalanche and a

793
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,280
half of vulnerability ok for example

794
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,290
another that had seen others in the third

795
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,180
minute to the second minute the web sharka is

796
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,910
that this application beyond  to

797
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,180
do as webcams very often do, i.e.

798
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,380
use the universal plug

799
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,910
and play protocol to ask your router

800
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,010
to be visible on the internet which is one

801
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,870
of the worst bestialities in history,

802
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,000
i.e. you put an object on

803
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,530
that universal plug and play on your

804
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,140
internal network  protected by your nat and

805
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,360
this object tells your router and

806
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,890
hello hide enabled then

807
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,360
disable the a  iverse plug'n'play

808
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,490
tomorrow if you have it enabled

809
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,310
I would like to be visible from the internet the

810
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,650
router says but of course which port you need

811
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,410
trakl 81 go calmly then from that

812
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,060
moment on on the public ip of

813
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,620
your router on port 81 and

814
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,020
yours is accessible  webcam then

815
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,630
that vulnerability above for

816
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,100
those who do not want to use

817
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,350
the public address of the cam directly there is also

818
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,030
a beautiful application in claudio

819
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,320
I had never seen such a crap

820
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,120


821
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,220
with ten minutes of white shark this

822
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,990
application in the cloud practically in

823
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,940
capsule i  naked p then send the

824
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,380
beaver packet to a server on

825
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,510
amazon on the vs

826
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,120
ok of the http traffic then it makes some

827
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,100
pc packets it makes http requests

828
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,760
and throws her and the answers so

829
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,640
obviously all clear not only in

830
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,440
this traffic it also puts us  the

831
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,150
serial of the camera which is easily

832
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,820
predictable so it is not that zk

833
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,820
underscore 914 his is different no if

834
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:03,350
real the camera is 000 1000 2000 3 if it

835
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,200
joins this  I am passing by default to man of the

836
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,640
application in the cloud a request by

837
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,559
saying only the owner of the camera

838
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:11,900
serial 1 with the default password

839
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,120
you show me my room if you take the

840
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,960
default step you

841
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,250
see the room of any other

842
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,780
then dozens of projects  of

843
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,490
different products all derived from the same

844
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,260
signature universal plug and play

845
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,300
default credentials so much so that the

846
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,610
famous botnet mirai also used the

847
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,770
credentials of this of this room

848
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,410
here an out by pass on the

849
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,920
login interface known since 2004 traffic in the cloud is

850
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,600
absolutely no chance to

851
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,250
have the slightest update of

852
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,660
the camera signature there is the only

853
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,340
possibility is to buy a

854
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,200
later model hoping that they have fixed

855
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,040
the vulnerabilities you have this is

856
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,170
one of the 500,000 articles per week

857
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,210
that come out on webcams open on the

858
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,630
internet c  'is a lot of broletto mouth sites

859
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,100
so this genre that show me

860
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,710
webcams at home these are

861
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,000
the most shocking because there is  d'ippo

862
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,730
control room of a nuclear power plant

863
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,929
children and things like this

864
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:07,610
let's close that we are already

865
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,170
behind the times

866
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,410
then this is the ohio ti acta

867
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,600
surface arias so it definitely has the

868
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,030
resource we say that if you want to develop

869
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,490
help and if you are developers  of help

870
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,170
you have to go to know how your

871
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,720
pockets are to know what are all the

872
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,040
attack vectors the whole

873
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,870
attack surface that when you develop a

874
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,330
signature in an application etc. you

875
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,990
have to go to advice

876
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,530
then to properly manage this

877
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,780
wireless stuff in stand for internet

878
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,240
then  when you make an object you help

879
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,310
this object remember that it will end up on the

880
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,470
internet and the internet is an

881
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,100
extremely violent eco system extremely

882
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,230
attack where you have 4 billion people

883
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,790
who do not even know who they are who

884
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,920
may have

885
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,020
zero day vulnerabilities or simply be able to fly

886
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,790
may want to enter yours

887
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,340
more or less targeted object is not that

888
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,170
they have it with you eldo cojo co  jo that is they

889
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,870
sweep the whole door 81 ok

890
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,150
and if he finds a webcam as the

891
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,260


892
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,560
vulnerability there he entered it then I go to see what

893
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,969
security by design is privacy by design

894
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,370
this fortunately you have it requires it

895
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,960
in theory also the gp was therefore  at least

896
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,730
this at least as a term should

897
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,760
be quite known and then secur

898
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,560
software developer lifecycle that is to

899
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,210
think from the perspective of

900
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,940
software development with adding security

901
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,980
at the beginning I never at the end

902
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,310
as often as we do then I recommend using

903
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,168
platforms framework protocols and

904
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:37,449
standards  known and

905
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,980
safe usually especially in the

906
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,449
cryptographic field but more generally in

907
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,530
computer security

908
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,780
whoever invents hot water often

909
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,340
makes it cold ok

910
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,260
that is if you decide that you make

911
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,639
your own notification system

912
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,168
that no one knows how it works you are most

913
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:51,909
likely doing

914
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:56,860
ok more [ __ ] then go once you have

915
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,870
the product more or less working to

916
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,820
do a security review both from

917
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,620
the  to design is really technical

918
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,960
so a penetration test what is it

919
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,240
from someone who breaks that stuff

920
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,490
there at breakfast which is

921
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,270
certainly what makes sense I

922
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,190
still put in the slides that

923
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,840
I imagine will be downloadable from the eastern site

924
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,700
two or three links it has  it makes sense to read

925
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,050
because even there if I go to look

926
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,660
for security help on google I find 100 thousand

927
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,560
links

928
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,930
let's say that these are the most

929
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,270
interesting at least those in my opinion if

930
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,650
you have never looked at it go and

931
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,480
see shodan shodan

932
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,890
an internet search engine  of

933
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,200
things and you can search by banner per

934
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,970
door for things like this and

935
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,530
you will find a billion webcams a

936
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,060
billion industrial equipment

937
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,470
etc.

938
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,090
another object another site that I

939
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,930
really like elphinston collector what is

940
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,490
fim with collector is an engine of

941
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:51,280
research that searches only in the titles in the

942
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,869
extras of the cybersecurity conferences

943
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:53,640


944
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,140
keep in mind that for how

945
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,540
cybersecurity works now the  research

946
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,070
if I discover an

947
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,040
interesting vulnerability on gb on pippo tronic on

948
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,290
what it is most likely or I

949
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,300
do it because I do it for someone who

950
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,130
pays me very well I keep it a secret

951
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,540
public role because I want to

952
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,340
advertise I want to let myself be known

953
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,060


954
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,560
etc. so if you have tomorrow  to do with

955
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,880
a protocol with an object that you do not

956
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,010
know go there and look for the name of

957
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,560
that object siemens simatic what you

958
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,930
have probably found all the

959
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,480
public knowledge about what it is I did it

960
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,190
a security then the and the techniques

961
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,830
of attack towards  that kind of deal

962
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,450
we only overshot by six minutes

963
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,220
so at this point I would ask

964
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,410
you if you have any questions or if you have any

965
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:39,010
answers otherwise thank you and he went back

966
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,250
to putting on some music

967
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:47,880
[Applause]
