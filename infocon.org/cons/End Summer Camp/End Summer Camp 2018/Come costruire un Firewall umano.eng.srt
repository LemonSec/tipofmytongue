1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
then 20 25 minutes in short we talk about

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,299
non-technical things because clearly here

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,830
we are talking about the h factor

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,710
I speak on behalf of isaac after visp I

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,039
give you a face a flash on who on the

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,060
association for undertow I made

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,680
a couple of publications in 2013 on the

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,480
rules  of engagement for a penetration

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,580
test and the following year on let's say on the

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,308
violation of industrial systems

11
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,500
the topic conceals today's talk

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,290
presents the latest research that in

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,629
fact works the patronage also of

14
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,550
discomfort as well as some associations

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,879
even if a  work in progress precisely on the

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,230
problem of wellness and jacket

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,629
I know that it is a non-profit association

18
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,840
that groups people who deal with

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,870
t governance and cyber security but

20
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,290
more at an organizational

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,830
level at the business level does it offers courses and

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,920
is clearly  all things vender

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,540
neutral the after maybe we also

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,700
do them a flash I tell you but

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,130
basically it makes disclosure

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,290
so for example the photo that there

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,450
in b  ace you see we

28
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,049
sponsored the cyber challenge

29
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,360
that has been talked about a bit about but lately

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,329
after macaroni then the contest at

31
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:34,350
an Italian level

32
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,270
then the constitution of a team

33
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,670
that does ethics activities the king and the

34
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,329
try to go and challenge the rest

35
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:43,350
of the world

36
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,080
at the level of count

37
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,040
isaac in three chapters there is milan rome and

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,250
venice venice is the most

39
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,880
recent chapter we are about 250 members we do

40
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,980
indeed disclose some

41
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,830
events the next events we make one

42
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,280
on 27001 at villa manin where we

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,280
also bring a couple of  testimonials who have

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,039
embarked on the certification path

45
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,130
and maybe someone knows the event that

46
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,230
never the sixth edition on

47
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,480
application security that I think we do

48
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,470
in October at ca foscari and therefore it is a

49
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,290
very talked day

50
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,459
so let's say there are also

51
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,320
international testimonials so basically

52
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,180
we do  we make disclosure and in

53
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,040
cyber security issues well because

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,350
this is the starting point in short  l

55
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,790
as regards the part of the

56
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,790
awareness because it is the problem

57
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,459
of human error it is an

58
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,730
absolutely important aspect so here I

59
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,120
took an article of some let's say

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,160
some time ago there are

61
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,470
conflicting voices but substantially a

62
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,150
sum director that the postal police

63
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,790
some  some time ago he had made an estimate

64
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,670
that 90 percent of accidents are

65
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,900
due to the human factor

66
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,830
and he is certainly the person a little more

67
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,180
competent who also wrote a book.

68
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,489


69
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,019
the

70
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,150
burglary tools for which those who have

71
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,080
read it

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,150
in short find things that find

73
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,010
content that despite being an

74
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,260
absolutely old old book in short,

75
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,590
is still valid today because in any case

76
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,370
we are talking about vulnerability on a

77
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,620
psychological level but basically it is

78
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,150
recently I had to face

79
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,610
the topic  there is no documentation

80
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,700
no there is anything I found for

81
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,430
example a little book he wrote there

82
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,590
Franchina for those in the sector maybe they

83
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,730
know who they are

84
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,430
let's say about social genres but there is little

85
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,830
in short there are there is little

86
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,290
station and I got an idea that

87
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,760
the problem is linked to the fact that

88
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,430
psychological skills are needed, that is in the

89
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,290
sense that  however, whoever deals with

90
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,900
security is always a technologist here

91
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,220
you have to reason with a psychologist

92
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,900
currently, in short, psychologists who

93
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,210
will also be computer science surely

94
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,209
there are there are few

95
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,250
this is the structure of the white paper

96
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,839
more or less in short I told you  I have

97
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,450
done more than someone

98
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,070
so it is quite run-in

99
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,840
I normally do a survey I try

100
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,120
if I can also bring a business

101
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,580
that is therefore a real case of a

102
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,250
campaign maybe it is awareness raising

103
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,130
to explain how how to do it and this is

104
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,720
the working group then  I am the

105
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,180
coordinator then we also have

106
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,600
a sociologist inside who was a former manager

107
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,160
of information systems and in any case

108
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,610
people or all the people operating in the

109
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,250
company for  Because in my opinion the component

110
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,170
here that really makes the difference is

111
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,050
the experience only the user who

112
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,030
manages we tell their users

113
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,490
so whoever is in the training systems that

114
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,890
manages the users knows what are perhaps

115
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,880
the most common errors and errors

116
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,820
then I am  figured this the title is

117
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,980
born a little from this idea but that in

118
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,610
any case

119
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,030
the brain can be assimilated to a

120
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,699
firewall and therefore hypothesized and that

121
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,090
a firewall arrives that

122
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,030
you have just bought it you have to do the

123
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,580
configuration then define the

124
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,520
rules for

125
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,680
the accesses rather  what to do the arden

126
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,560
ying and then you put it into

127
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,349
production so I searched on let's say

128
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:46,719
this concept on google

129
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:48,330
this beautiful kit came out

130
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,779
on amazon that we say at the end clearly

131
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:55,750
school to assemble and brain

132
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,340
then the optics is that you receive

133
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,919
this thing here had to assemble it by

134
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,650
putting a minimum of hardening on it

135
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,949
so the effort here is certainly

136
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,229
not talking about  technology but let

137
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:11,919
's talk about some psychological bases let

138
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,210
's say about the functioning of the mind

139
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,449
so let's say the brain is anyway

140
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:21,340
some me I'm not a doctor so

141
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,409
discouragement and coppo I can say

142
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:27,099
[ __ ] and let's say I'm not going to deal with

143
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:30,490
the topic in depth but

144
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,949
who has it  done who does it for a living

145
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:35,169
let's say he defined the

146
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:36,279
rules well so there are

147
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,039
real vulnerabilities a bit as we say

148
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,830
there can be vulnerabilities on

149
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,159
a system even the brain nor any and

150
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:49,060
therefore fear the concept the prize

151
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,599
the curiosity are aspects let's say  that

152
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:56,050
are the vulnerabilities of this thing that

153
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,710
is part of my security system

154
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,509


155
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,680
these things here are clearly

156
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,659
usually well known for example to those who

157
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:07,689
sell those who sell I know if you have ever

158
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:11,680
heard of pnl pianelle are strategies

159
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,949
of

160
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,560
interaction between the user also  in the

161
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,449
language in the way of posing for

162
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:20,050
the sale

163
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,270
then those who make the sale know very well

164
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,460
these vu  lnerability

165
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,949
what is the concept that if it goes into the field

166
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,690
of security

167
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,610
the impact maybe it can be it can be

168
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,639
different anyway here is let's say

169
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:37,060
the brain is part of the people who

170
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,220
are my users it is part of the

171
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,590
security system and therefore the myth is

172
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,080
let's say that  maybe you have seen

173
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,380
dave's cartoon so the point is

174
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,289
that I do packing I do hardening

175
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:52,660
I behave etcetera etcetera

176
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,760
and then on the other side or of the

177
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,520
dave users who continually create

178
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
flaws in me and so this thing here

179
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,830
I have to take into consideration and do with it

180
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:07,229
some reasoning absorbs the

181
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:09,729
work in progress so this here is not

182
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:11,740
the work is not finished the publication is

183
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,669
not finished yet his party let's say

184
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:17,410
two three months in short we are working

185
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,160
now we have about 35 answers and

186
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,500
these are the questions you see that

187
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,190
anyway the topic  it is precisely linked to

188
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,300
the human factor are typically companies and

189
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,690
we say

190
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,750
companies that are now not in

191
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,539
public administration services  one a little less the

192
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,360
cut of the companies is quite large

193
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,770
and this in some way especially

194
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,190
on the question linked to that we say them

195
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,170
with the orange slice

196
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,690
if you can then see the answers

197
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,980
then it is linked a little to the type

198
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,950
of sample after we stop on this

199
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,750
so what goes first one of the

200
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,820
questions of which this here the result is

201
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,550
there are computer accidents

202
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,620
due to human error so you see

203
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,290
that compared to the initial screen they

204
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,240
are therefore we are talking about a 72

205
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,500
percent but what is the problem with the faith

206
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,580
of the slice  red no, that is,

207
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,640
while on other things

208
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,720
when this question is asked about

209
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,030
penetration tests or security problems

210
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,350


211
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,480
if I talk to those who follow security

212
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,660
maybe they deliberately say no that is,

213
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,540
however, not for a disclosure speech that

214
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,610
problem is that probably share part

215
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,230
of  those freights and also because they do not know

216
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,930
because the user is difficult to

217
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,140
admit that he has been cheated in quotation marks and

218
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,440
therefore in here  that no that is already

219
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,840
a bit reduced compared to the standard

220
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,460
in my opinion is reduced dramatically

221
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,160
because probably the head

222
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,440
of logical security does not even know that

223
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,390
his users have done some [ __ ]

224
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,760
in quotation marks maybe he is then the

225
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,530
problem but he cannot understand who did

226
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,250
it  the trigger another question is

227
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,310
in the event of a cyber incident

228
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,610
people do not know what they have to do and

229
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,200
therefore here you see that at least most of them,

230
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,530
at least linked to the sample,

231
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,850
can be traced back to the training systems

232
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,820
if I had probably gone down with it

233
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,740
if the sample was of companies  a

234
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,050
little smaller the slice in quotes

235
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,360
of the nos which is quite small

236
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,580
would probably be a bit

237
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,000
bigger here there is also a certain concept

238
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,250
of maturity so the orange slice

239
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,280
that demonstrates that for individual

240
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,500
accidents users know what to

241
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,010
do

242
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,440
means  that somehow here or

243
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,990
of the users at least according to those who answer

244
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,090
that they are a little more mature then instead

245
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,910
for or  Instead of calling

246
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,310
training systems or those who deal with

247
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,980
safety for managing

248
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,050
incidents, users may know in quotation marks to

249
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,830
debunk the basic problems so

250
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,230
here somehow demonstrates a certain

251
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,520
level of maturity on his program

252
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,530
another thing is  tests are made

253
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,670
on to measure

254
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,570
the level of security

255
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,970
so the most classic things

256
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,670
are clearly the vulnerabilities to penetration

257
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,950
tests if you are interested that there is the

258
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,530
understood it is the notebook that I

259
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,020
told you that I have taken care of the rules of

260
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,780
engagement is freely  downloadable fate

261
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,990
search notebooks isaac in venice and

262
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,120
the notebook is the number one notebook we do not

263
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,220
talk about this and we do not talk about magic or

264
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,580
office-like concepts because

265
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,350
now even the difficult tests,

266
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,360
let's say in a certainly

267
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,830
corporate environment, are also starting to be

268
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,200
fairly standardized what is the

269
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
problem is the aspect of

270
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,920
social engineering because engineers and social is

271
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,310
the real test  in the h factor then in

272
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,200
this speech of the firewall of the

273
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,100


274
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,830
human firewall and you see that the answers are

275
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,050
very low on 35 1 he said that he does them

276
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,430
because talking about social in general

277
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,160
because it is an absolutely

278
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,650
important component so these this text

279
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,180
here taken from a slide of let's say  by

280
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,350
raoul church of 2009 so we are talking about

281
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,320
almost ten years ago this is that

282
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,720
however the bad guys have understood they have

283
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,840
learned to use the narrow let's say

284
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,750
social engineering and this wait

285
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,090
will be more and more advanced because

286
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,460
clearly milic stuff today of

287
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,890
the security apparatuses or in any case the

288
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,340
technological and self-supporting part then

289
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,840
artificial intelligence etc.

290
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,460
etc. so it will be more and more

291
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,520
sophisticated so the importance

292
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,940
of the h factor of the human capacity

293
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,670
wait will grow if you want to

294
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,280
see a good movie but you have

295
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,800
already done it that of el is the title and

296
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,690
in short, there is this image of this woman

297
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,750
who tells is that she presents

298
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,240
herself as ingenuity  social re and explains on

299
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,800
the other hand a person who deals with

300
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,800
security how he manages to convince his

301
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,410
wife to give him all the data and he

302
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,000
says absolutely no my wife is

303
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,740
trained and knows it is instead let's say

304
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,480
also exploiting concepts for

305
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,330
example of affinity  in short, there is a moment

306
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,390
during the film that

307
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,090
on the other side the wife a little

308
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,450
reluctant is made to start the noise

309
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,380
of a child crying this thing here

310
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,270
decays we say the inhibitory brake

311
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,980
so the person on the other side

312
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,380
assumes that we  is a mother who has

313
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,100
problems as a mother and so let's say

314
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,140
the harmony is there so

315
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,290
somehow then the rules

316
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,060
certainly fall in any case social in general it

317
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,890
is something that we all use no, that is

318
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,350
in the sense that if I had to understand

319
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,600
with  someone I look at his social profile

320
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,790
so surely it is an

321
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,430
important aspect and it will grow let's say in my

322
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,400
opinion that he will leave more and more this

323
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,120
is a let's say a nice intervention done by

324
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,610
those in fashion from seas  or a few years ago

325
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,070
on the illustration of an expert and shawn

326
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,680
test and this nickname makes you understand a little

327
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,790
no so here there was just

328
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,850
the illustration of a case of a priest

329
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,800
on the text the aim of demonstrating

330
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,440
vulnerabilities and all the initial phase

331
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,620
of  goethe ring had practically given

332
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,089
negative feedback then and password

333
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:48,879
strong so doing the bag

334
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:51,009
could give nothing

335
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:54,370
the hardening was quite advanced and

336
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,490
then in the end one is forced in

337
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,649
this case to fall back on social

338
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,410
engineering they found a bus

339
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,749
the illustration of a  real case they

340
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:07,990
found the receptionist who had

341
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,910
passion then the year targeted

342
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,559
passion for apps

343
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:15,579
well her child so let's say up to

344
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:17,649
give to her child then they made a

345
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,009
few words they sent me an app

346
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:23,009
then compromised the cellphone

347
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:26,379
4g connection and with the wifi  internal

348
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:29,319
ghetto then gateway towards to

349
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,839
enter with the perspective of beams a back

350
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,149
door then hypothesize in short this

351
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:38,139
mobile phone incan  descente that let's say I have to

352
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,730
work to get a more solid back do

353
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,949
because if this turns off my

354
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:44,499
mobile phone, however, the whole phase of

355
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:47,439
summer escalation started from a

356
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:50,110
social engineering activity has

357
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,559
however it is ineffective

358
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,120
so what is the characteristic of one

359
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,009
of social engineering  one thinks of the

360
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:59,829
one with the sweatshirt there is not that there is

361
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:01,660
a photo for example of one who was then

362
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,329
arrested and who had skills and

363
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:06,129
let's say in some way of hacking of

364
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:08,290
social genres and wanted to break into the

365
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,120
world of fashion then they have it  taken

366
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,199
this is not the stereotype of who

367
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:17,110
makes who makes who is so what are the

368
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,259
characteristics of social engineering

369
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:23,139
with skilled interpersonal skills and a person

370
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:25,509
who hides in any case but in the end that is,

371
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:27,429
if you see for a moment those lyrical things

372
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:29,939
fundamentally does not necessarily have

373
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,410
skills  of a technological type

374
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,079
therefore those who do ethics activities the king

375
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,569
santa madonna must

376
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:39,970
also have technological competence those who do social

377
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,550
engineering no and therefore  of in the end

378
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,309
let's say simplifying the vision is that

379
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:48,129
a salesman who uses

380
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:50,410
neuromarketing tactics for criminal purposes

381
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,819
so that is what is

382
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:53,260
possibly on the

383
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,560
other side how it works

384
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,900
surely is also based on

385
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,000
targeting the person so it is a bit of

386
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,970
a difference  between the fiji and the spy I mean

387
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,540
I still have to aim it and then

388
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,079
let's say the aspect of pretending to be authoritative

389
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,240
give support hypothesize to give

390
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,480
support then exploit ignorance

391
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,839
on the other side let's say who is

392
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,660
mine my my prey are

393
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,849
fundamental aspects  and therefore in some way

394
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:28,960
you have to pay attention to

395
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,150
people looking for information but

396
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,120
in my opinion this also lies in let's say in

397
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,040
what for example I do, that is

398
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,140
surely if someone asks me for

399
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,910
information at my house he makes me the

400
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,650
marketing calls

401
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,570
I tell him look not me  interests

402
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,250
etc. etc. the same thing must

403
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,500
also be reported within the company

404
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,450
but here is this but this stuff

405
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,550
here called c  The brain is still made

406
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,700
therefore by those who study it from the

407
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,510
elements so there are 33 brains

408
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,390
so we call this three parts of the brain

409
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,610
so the part is the most extended part

410
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,520
then the most outward part is the

411
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,610
rational part and we say the part where

412
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,040
there is the intermediate brain 15 with an

413
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,400
intense rational veil and the intermediate brain

414
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,250
listens but whoever decides is the part

415
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,780
that is more low-level

416
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,960
so when the neanderthal man

417
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,730
let's say he began his

418
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,500
let's say his growth in terms of

419
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,680
knowledge  had let's say his brain

420
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,430
was first it was primitive and yet what is the

421
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,900
catch that is what they

422
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,810
decide so if I can

423
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,360
somehow compromise the

424
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,380
primitive brain it is the reaction

425
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,870
happens instinctively and then maybe

426
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,700
rationally I realize the

427
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,650
of the problem even more so if I

428
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,360
realize I also find it difficult to

429
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,520
disclose it so even what is

430
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,360
said the first the problem of saying that I

431
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,500
had an accident

432
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,680
d  we are of a social nature is because then I

433
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,750
realize that I made a let's say

434
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,000
made a chapel and therefore

435
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,340
somehow it shows a weakness

436
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,950
no but actually it happened to me

437
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,960
even recently it is a customer who

438
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,460
later fired the person that yes you do

439
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,830
it  you fired the doctors there may

440
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,290
be but it is clear that these here are

441
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,600
professionals so to people who work

442
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,400
at an advanced level if you have not

443
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,590
explained anything other user did not

444
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,300
inspire him what a

445
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,750
partner-type attack is yes maybe that  is the final outcome

446
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,540
but maybe you have to give it a moment

447
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,930
also of elements so in let's say the

448
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,350
primitive brain is still the let

449
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,880
's say the point the critical point

450
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,700
the thing to work on ten

451
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,670
commandments in the sense that we then say

452
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,110
to make an awareness campaign

453
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,060
substantially these  are the points to

454
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,450
touch because because for the brain to

455
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,310
learn I can only work here too

456
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,470
let's say at a

457
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:11,180
medical physiological level that is the

458
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,540
concept is that  and it is the repetition to the

459
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,550
emotion these are the only elements

460
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,310
for which one learns so when you went to

461
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,410
school to ask the question

462
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,320
continue reading the thing was created

463
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,500
the synapse and those oscillated to speak

464
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,760
to answer the questions to make the theme

465
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,470
or the  emotion the emotion one puts

466
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,270
his hand on the fire it is not that he has to

467
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,340
repeat it no that is to say one remembers for the

468
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,560
whole life that the hand that the hand

469
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,940
burns that the fire

470
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,050
clearly you tv so you must

471
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,480
somehow be able to pass it

472
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,330
let's say this what I will do there  'human you have to

473
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,140
go from an unconscious incompetence

474
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,650
to more advanced states so

475
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,940
the incompetence and unconscious

476
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,030
I would say that it is here very often it is the stunt

477
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,640
of my users that I have around so

478
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,110
they do not know and are also unaware

479
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,210
therefore already an advanced state and at least

480
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,520
of  to be not to know but to be

481
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,890
aware that is this is 1 st is already an

482
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,570
advanced

483
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:21,220
stage the stage let's say maybe the one let's say

484
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,800
more advanced is the includes a little more

485
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,100
evolved is the comp  conscious mind you have

486
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,560
finished a course on

487
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,840
cyber security the user before clicking

488
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,240
on the name of the buildings reads

489
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,040
carefully but the stage

490
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,650
the best is that of the

491
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,510
unconscious competence which is that for

492
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,010
example at the moment I am

493
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:49,090
walking breathing that is or a pocket

494
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,750
open on walking on breathing therefore it

495
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,290
is however not impacting on the fact that I am

496
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,390
talking so let's say they travel of

497
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,080
their own life

498
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,020
so that is the state the state the

499
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,300
point the point of arrival

500
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,390
primitive brain is still visual so if

501
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,630
you can get through let's say

502
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,630
visual concepts then  cartoons rather

503
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,270
than films the one with a greater grip

504
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,820
because let's say the brain remembers

505
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,010
precisely because the primitive part

506
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:25,390
remembers the part the images you can

507
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,060
do more and it is then the strategy maybe

508
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,770
in the banks that you do lately

509
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,080
always banks do a lot these cartoons

510
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,630
animated simplified in the business space

511
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,480
that will be later in the white paper

512
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,150
this was adopted  to this strategy you have to

513
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,770
give some indications on what to do

514
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,050
because this is also up to werner

515
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:47,110
so if you leave the user a free hand and

516
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,900
let's say him you risk that he improvises

517
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,540
maybe you have the good one who does it

518
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,090
correctly but the not good one if you do not give

519
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,490
him at least  an

520
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,530
IT regulation and he can't understand so

521
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,180
somehow you wrote

522
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,670
what the basic rules are he must

523
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,240
have them

524
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,000
and he signed it when he was

525
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,309
hired so somehow a minimum

526
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:11,500
of responsibility in what he

527
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,970
read as he had to

528
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,950
sign us  well I told him work in progress

529
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,780
but there are certainly some first

530
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,820
ideas that I can give you that is you have to

531
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,340
think about the primitive brain this

532
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,770
is the fundamental element to be able to

533
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,270
maximize the return

534
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,540
on investment on this type in

535
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,760
some way maybe awareness if it is

536
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,610
do towards us students

537
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,920
the concept is the fact of no we say to

538
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,200
do a continuous activity because

539
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,620
precisely if you do not reach alone  the state of the

540
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,720
conscious user but you have to

541
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,090
somehow create the synapse so

542
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,820
the user must act in an

543
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,640
unconscious way and on s ii it is a problem

544
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,500
however also of the brain I tell you for

545
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,140
example something related to passwords for example

546
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,880
that is eight-character passwords

547
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,050
we are all aware that they are

548
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,220
insufficient

549
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,600
so there are people who begin to bring

550
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,240
to 12 characters such as the rip-off that the

551
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,940
brain does not have the

552
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,500
physiological possibility of measuring to

553
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,590
memorize more than seven eight characters

554
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,360
so you bring it to 12 and then

555
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,250
automatically if the user writes it

556
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,830
a let's say on a piece of paper

557
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,559
so it is not a forcing with respect to the

558
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,620
physiological nature of the brain and

559
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,809
you have to take this into account you must also

560
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:34,990
think about let's say on the level of

561
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,910
maturity of my users so when

562
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,429
done in an IT regulation

563
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:41,020
sometimes I happen to find

564
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,990
very outdated IT regulations but it

565
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,730
is something that is

566
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,679
probably there in the making  and vulnerabilities

567
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,750
we are talking about now in two years they

568
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,670
will not even exist anymore no so we are

569
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,490
all aware that cyber security

570
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,730
evolves very very quickly

571
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,080
we must certainly start from who and most

572
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,540
critical icon spoke before let's say that

573
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,870
typically the paron is in the

574
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,900
starting stage 0  no, that is, he is but

575
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,850
whoever you want him to come from less that is in

576
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,930
the

577
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:14,480
unconscious sense and let's say he does not know, however,

578
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,190
it will not be the problem but alas and the

579
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,580
target defined by the attacker who

580
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,980
also makes a reasoning on the costs I go on

581
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,160
what he does the movements and with the

582
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,480
movements  financial in the

583
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,280
administrative managers has commercial information

584
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,290
commercial manager

585
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,030
the CEO i.e. they are the

586
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,210
targets for those who do social engineering

587
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,810
certainly the favorite one the signal

588
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,850
is to verify in different ways

589
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,740
then to the concept of females use

590
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,060
so you know that the news

591
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,910
if you want to repeat them  you are able to

592
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,670
distort reality and therefore also here

593
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,490
the fact that one introduces himself and

594
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,980
perhaps asks for information explain the

595
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,320
concept of making a check and

596
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,660
live on who is the interlocutor so

597
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,330
do not react instinctively but take the

598
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:07,160
time to answer me use

599
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,440
short and non-technical contents this is a  a

600
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,600
fundamental aspect precisely because we said that

601
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,290
the brain is visual to focus on the

602
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,360
personal sphere because in any case in my opinion it has

603
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,080
more grip

604
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,110
so let's say that if you explain that s1

605
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,990
you double click and it strikes you all the

606
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,140
photos of the holidays on your pc instead it does

607
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,480
the same thing on an example  company

608
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,010
maybe it makes more sense in short to do it

609
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,290
in the personal sphere and also form

610
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,240
your account parts so alas the

611
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,490
firewall h I do not have it only in the

612
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,170
company but it is also

613
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,310
with the counterparties and therefore we say

614
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,710
sir triggers  the whole speech two words

615
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:50,870
about let's say about isaca then do

616
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,510
neutral certifications in the world of

617
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,910
security are the most recognized

618
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,400
in Italy but it requires a little less but if  go

619
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,520
abroad and work cybersecurity if

620
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,080
you do not have the isaca

621
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,720
difficile certifications maybe that is, it is even worth more than

622
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,310
a degree in computer security in

623
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,800
short, it is clear

624
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,160
outside Italy they

625
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,170
are also those, let's say they are

626
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,510
definitely tough but then they are the ones

627
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,040
who also give you a  return this is

628
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,840
a statistic from a few years ago on

629
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,240
computer certifications therefore not

630
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,430
of security but computer certifications

631
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,480


632
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,490
the first is the I can and the one

633
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,010
on the implementation of the risk the earthquake which is

634
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,510
what they are mac and for those who make the

635
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,750
sisal min and the optimal  so, however, you give yourself

636
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,400
a vision also from the business point of

637
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,840
view

638
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,510
and then there is the cisa i am i cisa that

639
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,670
at this point it is a little more we call

640
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,400
it even more at a high level

641
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,420
well if you have not answered the

642
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,150
questionnaire do it I think that  the

643
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,950
publication as always will be

644
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,010
free then I hope it will be finished by the

645
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,420
end of the year

646
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,580
let's say we have just

647
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,360
started anyway if you have any

648
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,860
do  send if not I finished so that here

649
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,680
is the wing he put me and you are interested in

650
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,100
the topic if you like it you are

651
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,420
also interested in being part of the

652
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,530
working group

653
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:20,370
no problem in short ago 13 the only

654
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,540
thing is that how do you have to  dedicate

655
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,680
weekend evenings to these things someone but

656
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,920
in principle we divide the

657
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,330
capitoline that is here area anyway

658
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,360
reading is a bit like making a thesis in the

659
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,720
end no my goal is to be able to

660
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,700
give some rules in some

661
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,040
simple way not the ideas that you  I gave

662
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,230
this is the problem that

663
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,950
I found myself in this situation

664
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,660
normally I do the publications

665
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,210
because when I do not know I could start making

666
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,870
me understand but

667
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,000
in short, in short, it has always been ours to

668
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,410
do it for me I do it for the purpose of

669
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,970
dissemination  there is not in the sense that I

670
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,559
then share the

671
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,139
let's say the experience and I also share

672
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:09,509
let's say what I learned perhaps by

673
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:11,730
studying his on the individual topics

674
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,950
so it is a question of reading the

675
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,830
documentation what  there is therefore nic

676
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,620
surely I have read it but for

677
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,450
example where I am reading a book on

678
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,429
the brain where I understood these

679
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,460
aspects related to the state the speech is

680
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,710
that this is precisely how the tweet seems above

681
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,009
all not clear for who it is for who it

682
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:34,409
is let's say  psychologist absolutely these

683
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:38,190
are unmarked concepts on sales

684
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,659
if you are interested,

685
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,549
write to me and then we will evaluate in short, the

686
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:44,789
volunteers are always welcome well

687
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:46,590
thank you

688
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:52,220
