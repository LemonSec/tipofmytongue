1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,279
ok bye everyone again because it is from

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,519
this morning on this last tour

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,820
of the day I think I will tell you about dick

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,099
speech by mozilla I liked to bring

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,289
this story because I lived it a bit

6
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:22,080
as an outsider a bit of passages and it was

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,600
interesting to see how it is  it started from

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,460
a science paper for the shore with an

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,550
algorithm that is now an open source library that

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,920
can also be used in various

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,980
languages we will see I am stefania del

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,100
prete because she did not know me before I

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,610
always work for topix that a turin

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,030
piemonte internet exchange every year

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,879
we also do this school  of four

16
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,100
weeks called big d'hiv and

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,440
this year we also got to

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,710
bring a lot of consistency what my

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,109
colleague that I'm kidding

20
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,579
also bring a way of mozilla since

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,550
mozilla has been opened right now

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,470
a real

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,560
a real team  machine learning and in

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,190
particular on speech recognition

25
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,500
i have been involved with the

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,580
mozilla community before with berlin for

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,420
a year more than a  year in which we

28
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,460
created several events it was easy

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,500
because there was the office directly

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,260
in the city mozilla in europe the offices

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,470
in berlin london and paris

32
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,120
among other things i knew the berlin team

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,970
but this is nice because it came via

34
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,100
lissi di  vitali

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,440
ge returning then cuts we started

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,240
meeting the Italian community we

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,790
started to bring some wind and

38
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,310
some things that I had also seen in

39
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,990
berlin let's say why speech recognition

40
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,479
when at the time it was berlin type in

41
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,880
2015 this project

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
called vani al was activated  there was still time

43
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,369
for him to know it among the proxies that it is

44
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,810
an operating system for mobile and

45
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,840
dinners around these flames that were a bit

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,000
of the demos of this operating system

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,989
that lasted for a while then for one

48
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:18,120
reason plus another this this

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,340
process this project was

50
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,620
discontinued but the interest

51
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,620
in pennies nation continued and part of the

52
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,660
firefox resources were

53
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,730
directed to what is called

54
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,860
aid or connecte  d devices remained

55
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,430
strong

56
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,140
the request to still have a

57
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,819
special library with what was

58
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:42,519
still open source because various various

59
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:43,989
proprietary projects started

60
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:46,030
any so there was this interest

61
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,219
in particular you wanted to use a

62
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:51,549
system is used from start to finish

63
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:55,980
end without having let's

64
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,319
say filters at the beginning and at the end of

65
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,590
this system is the project started

66
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,209
through a study of a science paper

67
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,099
of baido project that publish several

68
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,319
researches at the level of artificial intelligence

69
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,250


70
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,069
in particular it started with

71
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:19,260
this with this  which you see as

72
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,230
highlighted because it is intense

73
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,569
enough to study if you want to study the sit down

74
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,019
print veil as you prefer take

75
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,660
this time this first edition was

76
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,010
from 2014

77
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,160
if then it had other versions

78
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,640
this of this research in the most recent

79
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,120
in 2017 the first in 2015 this  of with

80
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,150
English Mandarin and let's say the

81
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,359
process was started studying a

82
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:54,500
quind research  at the theoretical level a

83
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,819
project that has been

84
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,530
started to test take this

85
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,750
knowledge and bring it into an

86
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:07,230
open source project the key points of this

87
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,440
pepper were in particular not to have a

88
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,019
complex pipeline often in the past if

89
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,239
not used maybe I will run highlighted

90
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,839
something  previous tests that

91
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,608
had been from ago has perhaps just the ways

92
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,960
under however

93
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,660
with very very long processes but

94
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,699
instead it was possible to use

95
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:30,400
the ronnie directly more from the beginning to the end

96
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,440
to leverage the new technologies that

97
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,470
had developed as gpu in particular

98
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,750
now on the positions  of whom tab

99
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,229
there is also a product version

100
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,650
of pete sense without gpu but it is

101
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,699
advisable to say e and we will

102
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:51,940
soon see a big cake 7 to redo a

103
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,069
way to overcome these background

104
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,500
noise that you can imagine people

105
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,380
especially when you have a dialogue and

106
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,830
there are different types

107
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,630
of background there could be a

108
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,460
room with silence a  Absolute or

109
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,419
even voices around sometimes so

110
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:13,210
let's start by briefly understanding this the

111
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,720
key points at least of this article

112
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,120
for those who do not know it the neo

113
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,509
networks practically have a bit as

114
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:24,159
you can guess from the branch of

115
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:25,870
artificial intelligence taken some

116
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,720
names from the functioning of the neurons of the

117
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,349
brain

118
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:31,479
these  logically these definition

119
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,060
surprised a lot with the pliers because

120
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,349
it is even thought that there is more

121
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:36,849
in the white matter than in gray

122
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:39,340
so in any case speaking of assonance

123
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,800
with a neuron what you can think you will

124
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,050
give artificial are

125
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,990
these inputs that we see the beginning

126
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,979
inside  there is an activation function

127
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:52,449


128
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:55,210
that allows these inputs that are

129
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,940
taken to continue or therefore to remain

130
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,370
active question they had really no

131
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,979
an example can be for example here

132
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:04,419
we see just a sum of the

133
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:07,120
multiplication of the 2 of the value and of the

134
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,360
weight this usually wade  the weight if

135
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,400
there is a value

136
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,500
232 multiplied by 3 which is 6 yes

137
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,370
multiply the various excellent excuses

138
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,050
add up the various multiplications and

139
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,060
then add this b which is an ios hub

140
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,919
that you can self-pay that you can

141
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,229
finally add if to a certain number and

142
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:32,030
you pass everything in this

143
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,139
activation

144
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,789
function a very function  simple can be

145
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,400
a veil or a function with a kind of

146
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,830
threshold in which it says if on the period it is

147
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,150
a value of 10

148
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,860
then the new one remains active

149
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,580
otherwise it does not contribute to the neural network

150
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,909


151
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,039
in particular what we have here is

152
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:54,710
a recurrent and welcoming neural network

153
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:02,720
rmn in  which

154
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,039
unlike the classic type talking

155
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,190
about dp networks usually there is this

156
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,639
project of film awards in the sense that it

157
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,539
always goes on

158
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:17,090
let's say in the activation of the neuron of the

159
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,780
various layers in the various layers here is

160
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,540
slightly more complex and

161
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,520
what  allows the seals we can

162
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,190
see an image directly as

163
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,860
you can see there are flows that go a

164
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,680
little forward a little back 3 quotes has

165
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,630
been tested here  This neural network and

166
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,540
let's say in this way allows you

167
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,940
to practically deal with

168
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,150
complex and so different data such as

169
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,710
special mission or and end

170
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,110
there is for example also

171
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,840
a well-known dataset called

172
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,020
mixed in which different numbers and electoral are used

173
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,260
also  in this direction

174
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,240
in particular the lines expressed in the

175
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,420
papers were made up of different layers

176
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,630
so we have several of these layers

177
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,360
understood that I have to stay still

178
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,090
the first ones are for layers so as

179
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,260
we said before we do not yet have

180
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,040
this particular component of right

181
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,180
of identity let's say

182
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,389
we  another ghezzal video and then a

183
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:30,940
last one that takes the recurring input

184
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,950
from the previous ones so

185
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:41,200
we have 5 layers of depth in

186
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,659
particular share who is interested we

187
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,250
wanted to fulfill this condition

188
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,589
so we resell it up to who

189
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,839
like the input weight we have it

190
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,750
since this w is used a lot as if then

191
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,320
these by us in particular a

192
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,690
particular when I don't want to  we make the

193
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,760
margins in general the clones and a

194
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,029
subcategory use the data in

195
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,980
a supervised way in this case for

196
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,000
example you knew

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,190
[Music]

198
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,470
the sentence is for example you had a

199
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,300
writing of the component in order to

200
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,040
test that the algorithm worked

201
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,710
what you

202
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,300


203
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,810
this slight taken from and ranging even

204
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,770
a great same promoter of marbles in

205
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,170
particular from the course of

206
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,170
specialization of the learning type in which

207
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,970
all the lessons are open

208
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,130
I know that you pay if you do not want to do

209
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,560
that  final but you can also find them on

210
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,470
youtube on different apartments

211
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,170
available once we simply reviewed

212
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,170
it rains the set between the

213
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,880
part of doing training in which

214
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,970
the algorithm we say goes regular is

215
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,410
formed on the datasets that we

216
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,570
want to do we want to go and

217
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,450
check  of which we already know the

218
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,080
answer

219
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,870
let's say the solution is a test

220
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,870
part a head part where we want to

221
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,850
confirm the height then  we

222
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,580
let our algorithm go on for

223
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,240
example different vocal tracks and we see

224
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,390
the performance in the sense of performance

225
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,320
of the lake rhythm itself lately

226
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,180
especially with the access of more to

227
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,210
much stronger technical powers if

228
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,260
added

229
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,650
a set of dells in which  it does not look at

230
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,150
the actual performance

231
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,520
of the algorithm the more the performance

232
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,700
on the technologies themselves and these

233
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,250
percentages are recognized this 80 20 20

234
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,040
90 11 is a function of how much data

235
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,530
the dataset is larger, the more there is a tendency to

236
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,710
have a 98 11 because  having a lot of

237
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,560
data already the datasets even on one

238
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,770
percent are significant enough

239
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,360
to be able to test if the

240
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,050
algorithm part is the

241
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,050
technical performance part so this

242
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,320
was some of the highlights of this

243
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,010
article in addition also this in which

244
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,930
as I mentioned  then there was the

245
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,899
background in this research it was seen

246
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,899
that in addition to the problem of different

247
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,820
background there was this species  and

248
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,040
compensation by the people who

249
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,769
called rom borges ex where when

250
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,490
people had or perceived a

251
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,339
noisy background let's just change

252
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:41,529
the pitch itself of their own

253
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:43,420
voice intonation was also an

254
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,510
interesting enough effect to

255
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,040
say to go and cover find a

256
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,300
solution

257
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,649
in  particular the solution that was

258
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:54,010
used in this research

259
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,269
project was to have a dataset that a mix between

260
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:59,920
tracks with a silent background and

261
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,779
tracks with a background in which instead

262
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:05,380
there was enough noise and what was

263
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,940
then analyzed and that there  there was

264
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,990
too much divergence between a real dialogue and

265
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,000
this type of data set and it was seen that it was

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,550
quite performing

267
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,390
so after studying this

268
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,860
research project it was decided

269
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,520
to develop it

270
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,620
as a library that can then be used by

271
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,590
anyone who deemed the goal

272
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,200
they had set appropriate  and to have a web this

273
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,570
work network then what we practically guessed the

274
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,120
binomial of 10 for ce

275
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,930
nto usually the standard of 15 percent is

276
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,300
already good enough it was decided to

277
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,100
implement it through black to the network

278
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,410
using toulson flow that a

279
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,680
library made by google mind based on

280
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,690
a stage another point songs in

281
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,630
particular the thing that is then evaluated

282
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,720
more effective in the lake rhythm and

283
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,950
experimentation with parameters and

284
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,740
precisely find a large enough dataset

285
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,410
that ideally covers these

286
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,819
problems that we have seen before

287
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,530
so if closed use I think in

288
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,980
particular if you have never seen I think

289
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,770
the chrono fir but used is very nice

290
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,080
the la play crohn practically what you

291
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,420
see in the image is a

292
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,670
visual expression of what happens in different

293
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,550
layers and that is nice to start

294
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,470
playing with a neural network you can

295
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,810
also set the activation network

296
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,450
irait of learning there are also beyond

297
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,880
these  there is also a figure aspire in

298
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,620
which our

299
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,800
smoking completeness will go mad if we do not set

300
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,630
many many more things together

301
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,030
here we say that gives you the idea of

302
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,390
how a deep neural network works even

303
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,790
in computer vision in which at

304
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,970
the beginning the inputs can be more or less

305
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,910
let's say geometric and then inside the

306
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,130
neural network develops its

307
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,960
recognition patterns that plan  plan when

308
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,030
to recognize the real face in

309
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,800
this case it was used instead

310
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,209
as loose change connection

311
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:21,040
in particular the decided to

312
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,399
use this network this is the n

313
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,529
in particular s long short term and died

314
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:33,639
in which there are some components not

315
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,139
only of this

316
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:36,759
of  this little game to thank that

317
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,170
we have seen before but also of

318
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,170
the forget elements in which you can

319
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,929
go and neglect some elements to

320
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:46,949
continue your optimization to

321
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:49,869
go to optimize over obviously if you

322
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:52,839
used this adam optimiser which

323
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:54,579
concerns the optimization of

324
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:57,189
stochastic processes if someone interested I

325
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:00,670
left  here is the link to the recently

326
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,259
published paper I don't know how much there is

327
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:04,689
actually anyway mo  lto detailed on

328
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:09,490
how it works he then told me that the

329
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,649
very important thing with which a

330
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,480
person goes to play and then goes to play are the

331
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,249
different parameters different hyper

332
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,740
program tears and in particular it has been

333
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,839
seen that here we have used

334
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,779
open libraries also at the level of i

335
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:25,029
dataset which is something that you can

336
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:27,190
still go to

337
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,160
establish a priori and we see that here

338
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,930
we have precisely the training day again it

339
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,580
is the test dataset that you choose

340
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,290
then there are other parameters that we have

341
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,070
seen also let's say in this that

342
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,260
also responds from the  play here as for

343
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,340
example le poc

344
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,480
il reit which also gives the speed with which it

345
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,700
learns depending on the case

346
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,570
depending on what the need is and in

347
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,940
particular I put this link because

348
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,360
in this currently

349
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,940
the latest version is this 2.0  alfa 9

350
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,430
however in this documentation there are

351
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,670
more details also on these types of

352
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,230
parameters and a more

353
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,120
complete documentation on all the models so if

354
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,800
you want to go to see docum  entation I

355
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,750
suggest you to go to this link and then

356
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,230
eventually see the latest comits

357
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,290
that have been made so at this

358
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,270
time he had taken this speech books

359
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,040
etc. but there was also the desire

360
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,580
to make a dataset that would allow you to

361
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,320
have this type of variety that

362
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,750
improves more and more at a wider pace and in

363
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,880
particular a

364
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,400
new dataset has started to be created then

365
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,880
this project called common boys has been created

366
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,130
very very interesting in which anyone

367
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,760
can contribute from you to your

368
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,970
cousin to your grandmother

369
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,430
indeed I encourage you to incorporate more

370
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,440
possible people but they are welcome

371
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,160
absolute variety of grades

372
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,910
just see how it works at this

373
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,039
moment this data

374
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:08,150
at 7 and 12 terabytes can also be downloaded about 500 hours

375
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,349
at the moment the training was done the

376
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:15,619
dataset of the rhythm of species was

377
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,289
done with English  but if he intends to do it

378
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,599
also with different languages

379
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,299
in particular among all the languages that

380
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:25,130
at this moment there are really

381
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,110
different if a  It amounts to about 1,000 hours of

382
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:34,070
recording and it is a coincidence that with

383
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,919
the export of an Italian community that has

384
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:39,260
really written a lot of strings

385
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,179
because every community every language

386
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:43,940
needs a minimum number of strings and

387
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,580
validated a number of illegible characters but

388
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,020
which  are too formal etcetera

389
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,610
etcetera so that this project

390
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,130
can also start on the official website and

391
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,679
this boys after mozilla after ring flash

392
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:56,750
haiti if you want to contribute with the

393
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,059
Italian language in particular this

394
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:02,750
was the evening in which we

395
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,210
launched it at saw that at the voice  then

396
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,590
in the validation part and therefore

397
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,150
also funny I know you and what

398
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,070
happens then you swoop down on this site

399
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,539
click to say something and

400
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:22,909
this screen appears in which you read the

401
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:25,730
sentence and then if you want to put that

402
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,450
something happens you can go and do it again

403
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,049
courtesy

404
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:32,210
if you speak  with some people tell

405
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,960
him to put their commitment to

406
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,970
express in a good way and in a good way

407
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,799
reminds me that prim  when there is no

408
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:42,140
Italian too I happened to validate

409
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,700
some sentences in English then elected in

410
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,000
Spanish

411
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,990
choose the language then obviously

412
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,039
speak the language that was written

413
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:55,110
as you can see there is speak listen in

414
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,270
the listening part you do you start  to make

415
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,309
a first validation so that in

416
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:01,020
any case it does not happen that there are

417
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,760
wheel strings or strings whose

418
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,100
phrase is cut off etc.

419
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,750


420
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,070


421
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,900


422
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,960
one way or

423
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,080
another

424
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,780
then whitenews you are in addition to

425
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,500
contributing

426
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,559
logically with your voice and

427
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,158
your whole family

428
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,130
you can start from the deposits and

429
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,260
official documentation done very well

430
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,130
in particular there are several things to

431
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,430
install

432
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,490
what I recommend if used already

433
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,320
butchers used by  center this

434
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,350
maybe make you a virtual environment which is

435
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,020
always a good strategy because

436
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,450
another version at least

437
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,880
the last one is used  Once a

438
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,720
president version of tension said it

439
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,730
then there were buy in addictions to

440
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,460
install with probably some case

441
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,520
and in particular then I will give you the link

442
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,290
also a talk that guided step by step in

443
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,300
this process

444
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,780
if you want to contribute even more

445
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,580
maybe you have already seen neural networks

446
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,700
etc. both a part written in

447
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,200
python yes prof class yes and if you go to

448
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,720
the youtube part I suggest you

449
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,150
always talk to a crazy person who are

450
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,610
sometimes quite demanding let's say that

451
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,770
this year library where it is difficult

452
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,610
find oil free spago in leisure for

453
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,170
now it is possible in short by talking

454
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,460
about speech together for a moment even a

455
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,080
krait on rast believe a library type

456
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,770
on rast also pay bindings and for

457
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,130
stream then at the multimedia level if

458
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,390
enough covered and different resources

459
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,630
then  on speeches a channel on purpose

460
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,760
if you use that channel and

461
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,380
this machine learning channel that has now taken

462
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,420
part just like a real

463
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,320
team

464
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,990
and then that talk and I was talking to you this here

465
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,210
that was this year at the foster in

466
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,850
which we tell you a step by step to go

467
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,190
to the installation both for years of the

468
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,179
south to you very switch a little and if you want to

469
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:31,399
actually contribute precisely the

470
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:34,309
generation  of the same phrases for

471
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:37,309
example there is a person who increases

472
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:39,649
very interested in swimming or another a

473
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:41,539
particular book sometimes

474
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:43,759
these sentences occur very straight and on the note I

475
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,320
want to put a hand on physics

476
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,009
so if you want to contribute yourself

477
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:51,590
you can contact us in the community of

478
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,899
mozilla on telegram go to mozilla

479
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:55,250
italia.com there

480
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,279
are different channels this gives me access

481
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,250
all or directly on the forum

482
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,399
and that's all

483
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:09,559
and if you have questions now ways to

484
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,320
contribute or about libya often

485
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,779
on the article let me know that I am

486
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:18,460
available thanks

487
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:26,450
[Applause]

488
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,249
c  'is to be studied if I can not do a bit

489
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:36,740
of homework even for a hundred

490
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,350
articles

491
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,240
but in my opinion that with the gothic glue

492
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,850
there have been some examples  the interesting ones

493
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,980
in which you start to use these

494
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,860
algorithms are some and gottini so

495
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,499
in my opinion also on pablo he could give us

496
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:54,249
an eye interesting things from multiple sources

497
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,470
ok thanks to the time and good appetite good

498
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,750
evening

499
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,589
[Applause]
