1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,359
the web management part sail with dense

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,030
really in no time no that is

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,210
we have an excellent plugin called

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,960
qg stu web the kuji plugins have been

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,880
developed in python are really

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,980
many and it is also very simple and

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,369
develop someone good programmer

8
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,650
maybe it will put us a  afternoon to

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,510
be able to do what you need

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,970
then obviously there is also a

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,369
python console to manage the operations

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,829
I am not a good programmer I

13
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,059
have not learned to use food is from the console

14
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:40,559
however we have this plugin that

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,640
simply says create web map and therefore I

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,120
gives the possibility to export to a

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,930
map using one of the

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:56,789
major javascript libraries to another ok if I

19
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:07,740
feel one thing was better maybe they

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,490
touched

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,110
yes

22
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,820
ok so we said in a very

23
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,330
simple way if my need is how it can

24
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,870
be that of an active citizen  is to

25
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,390
publish the map of the

26
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,020
expropriation belt of the new ring road

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,700
unless we are within the

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,040
galatti guide  ca for hitchhikers for whom the

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,470
map must be in 3d and must have the

30
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,820
size of the universe more often than not,

31
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,150
insisting with the delegated public bodies

32
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,500
I can get a chef

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,380
file I can upload it here so let's

34
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,340
add for example a little bit

35
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:03,680
of the base map then  let's go and look in the

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,960
geo database of bt areas let's go and get

37
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,140
us there go

38
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,430
don't worry I'm fine what is

39
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,720
buildings e and at

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,380
least enrico now speaks like this in

41
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,890
my opinion because these are standard encodings

42
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,130
within municipalities

43
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,550
and floors

44
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,400
unfortunately I missed the add button

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
let's try sending

46
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,070
no

47
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,770
go for the double click yes here it has a

48
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,070
resolution problem so

49
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,850


50
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,720
we liked the soil map but it is not

51
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,370
particularly significant and here

52
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,810
instead you see that it has a series of

53
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,680
polygons let's leave  be the absurd colors

54
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,990
that all the

55
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,530
vehicular traffic areas and buildings give me and

56
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,070
each one should have even if you

57
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,739
associate  ato a series of

58
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:24,049
information this case also here

59
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:27,439
we have building type 01 means a

60
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,340
civil building just like the world of

61
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,220
0 1 new building also these all to

62
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,099
be decoded in reality this which

63
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,500
must be the king however

64
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,079
civil building then there is industrial

65
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,140
military  however we have polygons with

66
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,510
information with information associated with them

67
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,030
to publish this

68
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,040
information on the web this plugin

69
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,260
web interns created web map web maps

70
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,239
are normally made from an

71
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,230
html page and a javascript library that

72
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,560
cares about

73
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,069
[Music] let's

74
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:13,110
zoom in for a moment that cares

75
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,530
precisely to make

76
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,238
available to render the rennes to

77
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,850
render sorry for the term I don't

78
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,790
really get an Italian term to

79
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,060
render

80
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,790
the geometries we have so these or

81
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,980
the layer I decide which ones should be

82
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,490
visible I decide the

83
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,169
extension the map extension let's see if it

84
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:38,480
makes me  see something or if it crashes and

85
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,660
normally or even a preview I wanted to

86
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,960
publish  icarvi the html and then try to

87
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,550
dissect it because perhaps the

88
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,560
best process is to understand a little bit

89
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,680
how the web map works and go to

90
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,440
modify a code an already

91
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,280
existing code no but in short the data

92
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,650
are transformed in this case into

93
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,710
jayson but there  they can also be

94
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,200
other data functions then let's

95
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,669
settle for leaflets I put a

96
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,080
little too much meat on the fire

97
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,120
then let's make a simpler case

98
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,580
because I understand that they are let's

99
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,520
keep the roads if it goes well

100
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,699
ok so I do directly from export

101
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:13,070
makes a series of conversions and generates me

102
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,669
a  html page of which now let's go for a

103
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,919
moment see see here there is right on

104
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,779
a temporary folder there is an

105
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:28,860
html index in fact ok so the background is

106
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,379
always downloaded from the same server from the

107
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:33,240
same server the geometries can be

108
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,339
queried with the attributes we

109
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:39,149
have seen I can  I might want to

110
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,969
add other elements then

111
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,309
for example a search by address that

112
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:47,759
are already integrated in the libraries or

113
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,399
I can then go to extend

114
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,259


115
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:57,029
the libraries directly, let's see if we are able

116
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:59,849
to slightly modify the

117
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:04,289
code and in this case let's go and see

118
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:08,069
how the page structure is if you do

119
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:11,159
n't follow me because maybe

120
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:14,069
html is unpleasant for you to be difficult stop

121
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,849
me stop me  well i said something

122
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:21,659
strange up to here raise a hand and

123
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:25,050
try to then try to outline

124
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,499
the structure for what is possible

125
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:32,669
then i have a deal that has an id mep ok

126
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:35,399
so either this is the container of the

127
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,209
map for some strange reason

128
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:41,339
basically  the style of this i of

129
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,539
mep will in this case be full screen

130
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:48,240
but if I need

131
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,259
to apologize if I need to

132
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,319
put other elements

133
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,969
obviously I can use it with

134
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:03,239
any css so in this case

135
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:07,289
I reduced it without problems then everything

136
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:09,889
what's inside of mep is

137
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:16,019
generated by the javascript class

138
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:19,969
let's also open the source files through

139
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:23,539
some inclusions

140
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,789
this is the  our folder then I go

141
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,200
to open the code and html code is

142
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,260
quite simple no so this this

143
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,059
i of mep which is empty

144
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,010
originally then there is all these

145
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,910
libraries that are

146
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,620
loaded the data actually are

147
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,430
still loaded with a

148
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:00,020
javascript script and are transformed

149
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,930
simply in a

150
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:10,399
jason format so in fact I suffered too

151
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,690
long it can actually be inside

152
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:20,089
the common js file no no I have nothing

153
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:24,649
but one a variable that contains

154
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:29,020
all the data all the data of the municipalities

155
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,970
basically then this content is

156
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,130
made a  moment so let's see for a moment

157
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,560
what there can be of flat a and the

158
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,740
fundamental library basically

159
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,120
let's see if it shows it to me

160
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:49,640
from here ok

161
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,920
I think these are precisely the polygons

162
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,470
that is or a variable that is called jason

163
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,880
that is common to all the coordinates of

164
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,000
all  polygons inside objects

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,970
objects jayson ziani rightly

166
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,910
loads it a bit in one line so it generally

167
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,140
takes a bit

168
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,140
obvious  then what or

169
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,880
programming the real map

170
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,430
that is to create a map object that

171
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,880
normally has a dimension and also

172
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,970
an extension then there is a

173
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,670
very important attribute control which is the one

174
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:31,350
that is showing me practically

175
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,660
reflects the gisti web but here I should

176
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,230
add also the region of Veneto and

177
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,940
dinners atlas of the lagoon because I am

178
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,640
showing data that are not mine or

179
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,430
in the case of an open street map, however, here is the

180
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,000
attribution control that we

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,030
saw there then of which I have a first layer

182
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,610
that he calls it overlay basic map

183
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,120
without  and this one downloads it from the server

184
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,610
of the many one is our

185
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,910
background bar it gives it some settings that

186
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,160
it took from cookies but see they are

187
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,070
easily editable and then it does

188
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,220
an operation of the maps method to one of the

189
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,560
layer and then adds this layer

190
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,920
this  layer to the map if I

191
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,330
go to the console but first player

192
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:34,050
probably if there is remove layer is a

193
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,130
bit strange as a name

194
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,730
most likely  my the year disappears

195
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,180


196
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,519
ok so I can also do this

197
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,040
dynamically there is a legend etc.

198
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,750
after which this is the function that

199
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,350
generates the pop up and then says recover

200
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,240
all the data no of the vector file

201
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,450
all the attributes and go to create  a

202
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,120
table and they are the ones we had seen

203
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,110
before

204
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,209
or we had not seen them are these that is

205
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,010
here there is only the municipality of Venice but

206
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,779
the layer of the municipalities is well present

207
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,940
let's see if displayed it hides the

208
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,250
red line you see and allows me to

209
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,589
query the other things  ok then the

210
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:22,630
function that is a function that goes on the

211
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,459
pop up and briefly here is the style

212
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,980
for the municipalities which is what gives me

213
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,810
the color of the first but you see that

214
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,960
for more or less it is a red and

215
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,360
there is instead  rai 10 5 therefore have a

216
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,780
dotted line and then at the end once

217
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,150
common dyers have been prepared, i.e. the

218
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,720
common dryer function is not the same for the

219
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,020
vehicular area so let's try for a moment to

220
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,529
change the style

221
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:57,790
because something unwatchable is the color film

222
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,439
.  let us also passito 0

223
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:08,769
if I update if a day the map I should

224
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:13,360
have the roads not of that violet but

225
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,940
with only the outline

226
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,410
ok so we no longer have the

227
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,920
violet filling that was there that there was a moment

228
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,389
ago enough question and that is yes  here you can

229
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:31,130
go on obviously if there

230
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,430
are functions

231
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,320
this leaflet but roughly

232
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,920
functional yesterday leaflet indicated for a

233
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,709
quick publication does not manage

234
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:44,959
mood multiple reference systems

235
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,089
open layer can also manage re-

236
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:49,550
projection then layers from different sources

237
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,899
as we had  a first practically

238
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,260
because here I have different reference systems

239
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,720
and the

240
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,570
is the

241
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:05,060
is the software that is taking care of

242
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,510
overlapping them practically these

243
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,820
we have it in monte mario that the municipalities

244
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,330
while the city and should be

245
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,120
seen in the new

246
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,190
reference system  area dnv tm 32 however

247
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,030
updated to 2008 substantially

248
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,400
so here anyway it is the software that you

249
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,160
all have internally with

250
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,020
different coordinates  the software takes care to

251
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,510
put them out instead in the

252
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:45,000
element in the web element

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,649
you see that the coordinates are all

254
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,959
latitude longitude therefore cousins

255
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,300
in exporting converts the geometries

256
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,970
so leaflet definitely fast if I have

257
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,370
data that can also be

258
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,740
subject and deformations etc. I don't

259
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,750
have to draw  people open day is the

260
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,899
most complete it allows with two three five

261
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,360
months of work it also allows you to make a

262
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,630
complete environment with editing and

263
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,279
overlapping etc.

264
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,680
but then there are various approaches because

265
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,450
if I were to make an environment

266
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,149
in which the  people must be able to cut out

267
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:23,120
the portion of a meteorological event

268
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,860
provided that someone perimeters the area

269
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,260
of hailstorms that falls within their

270
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,810
municipality for an insurance request

271
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,520
I personally would do everything at the

272
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,920
database level one table with these

273
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,480
geometries another table with the

274
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,540
geometries and with  a simple sl I get

275
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,270
the intersection or the offset the

276
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,700
buffer and this and que  ste that are the

277
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,649
classic geographical operations questions

278
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,509
yes my question of the developer more

279
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:07,329
than since I do not deal with jeans

280
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:11,499
but by eye the coordinates year 16

281
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:14,110
decimal digits are actually used because

282
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,740
that stuff there I started to mess

283
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,660
terribly because if the

284
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,720
decimal digits like this  by eye, that is, if you reach

285
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,290
the fifth digit in our latitudes,

286
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,809
maybe a cure expected around 200

287
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:31,420
meters if I remember correctly if some

288
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,589
of the colleagues for whom that is jan are beyond

289
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:38,620
the fifth digit is problematic in short,

290
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,160
even thinks 20 meters in the sense of a given data

291
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,920
from the mobile phone which can

292
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,980
still have a therefore the classic geo-

293
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,519
referenced photo or the user report

294
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,800
clearly is that it gives you the idea of an

295
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,339
accuracy that is not there my question

296
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:59,920
was related to that exports

297
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,620
because if I have to export a  map and

298
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,659
then load it I must also think that

299
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,699
people have to visit that page and it

300
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:08,859
is the loading times of the data

301
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:11,799
used all quan  to it makes sense to

302
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,809
export it figures as in that case there

303
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,849
is a system to truncate the data in the

304
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:18,189
judgment of which gis bad now here

305
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:20,319
we have to go to evaluate who made

306
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,319
the plugin if used in

307
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,429
existing libraries so yes if I have to

308
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:29,159
clearly optimize this  then comes at the end

309
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:33,929
but this too jason has verified

310
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,840
a painting if he has to publish it

311
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,940
also reduces it in size even by

312
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,769
removing this is already on a single line

313
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:46,289
this is at the level of example it would be

314
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:48,749
worthwhile to export with fewer figures but

315
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:51,269
also with much fewer vertices  so

316
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,399
depending on the display scale

317
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:56,249
if I have to see all the Veneto I do

318
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:58,110
a simplification operation within the legis

319
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,289
or instead of taking

320
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,360
this which is the level of the

321
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,669
administrative limits of the Veneto region therefore

322
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,499
very detailed to make them

323
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:09,869
istat limit values which is very  less

324
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:15,980
detailed there are various points in which to

325
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,159
optimize the process

326
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:22,080
I would always take it upstream

327
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,629
because this also means the times

328
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:28,350
loading no inside cookies

329
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,480
for example a trivial thing a

330
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,309
trick that I teach you who

331
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:35,070
may have already seen it and then explain the

332
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,679
architects who say when I go to do

333
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,659
the loading if I disable this

334
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:41,879
view here is much faster to

335
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:45,450
load  all the data if now I

336
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,210
just have to put a figure at the Italian level

337
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,240
no as it was that of the landslides the breast

338
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,649
also from what starts from us

339
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:54,629
let it be

340
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:56,730
now that I am waiting for you to draw it all

341
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,429
anyway among other things on this

342
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:03,299
video card that is  limited so it is always

343
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,809
better to do it upstream so this is a

344
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:08,820
problem in the sense that when it does the

345
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,070
re-projection evidently the

346
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,399
projection algorithm says I am in doubt I take

347
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:16,950
16 digits because beyond a value in meters

348
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,289
then a value in meters starts and

349
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:22,470
so if I say meters with a comma and

350
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,480
then the food software maybe this

351
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,029
is a precise figure to the centimeter

352
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:29,669
then I give it six figures because if in

353
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,220
doubt the software does so it would be

354
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,440
better to proceed  ssato a rule may be enough

355
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,629
the expression from the top of the

356
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:38,580
programmer however as a

357
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,049
programmer you happened to

358
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,580
publish maps to have this

359
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,330
request

360
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,210
there were it came to my mind just

361
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,279
seeing

362
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:49,219
but it's fine in my opinion there is then the

363
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:50,869
most beautiful

364
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:53,359
me working  in gis the thing that gives me the

365
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,739
most satisfaction is that most of the

366
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:57,109
time a team work is done and therefore there

367
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:59,599
are also different skills etc.

368
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,340
so I recommend that

369
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,029
if you are dealing with geographical data

370
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:07,279
compare with someone of good type

371
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,820
enrico like the  genius like daniele

372
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,440
in short, then if they are busy,

373
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,580
call them also because, however, also

374
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,559
simply an email an email in the

375
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,679
mail list on the site also to understand so as

376
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,719
not to perhaps take a path that then

377
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:27,349
from the point of view of the method of tying

378
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:30,320
hands in short normally when  there is the

379
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,239
request I want on the website of the

380
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,759
map where we are one takes the google bees it's

381
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:37,099
fine if I have to put a

382
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:39,320
point but you see that we already have

383
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,179
mes  I know the administrative limits we have

384
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:44,179
put the infrastructures that google

385
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:45,830
has drawn them has drawn them as he is

386
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,160
interested if I am a company

387
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,500
that makes exceptional transports maybe I

388
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,630
already have a map of the bridges where I cannot

389
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,200
pass so it can be useful to

390
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,280
me sorry go ahead

391
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,409
yes it was  published some time ago a 6 a

392
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,120
very long article by a cartographer

393
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,140
had analyzed google maps and

394
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,929
the algorithms that apply

395
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:27,039
mainly artificial intelligence to

396
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,010
represent the maps and one thing that

397
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,710
google does for example is clustering

398
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,470
on the start the types of features  so for

399
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,519
example if I have a city it is a priori I know

400
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,470
where the buildings of the

401
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,639
shopping centers are it makes clusters and it tells you

402
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:47,049
which are the shopping streets to

403
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:49,419
say that in the sense there are

404
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:54,389
clustering functions on escaped yes then I

405
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:57,190
accompany the question of who  gis

406
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,559
through this interface called

407
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:02,529
processing it is possible to use

408
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,470
practically a series of all open software

409
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,929
that have d  For example,

410
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:10,450
free of charge libraries that after 30 years of development for

411
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,639
analysis etc. then

412
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:15,519
various dinner functions require a lot

413
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,769
the simplest thing in terms of

414
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,399
web map if I actually a series a

415
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:22,510
series of points

416
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:28,169
let's see if I find for a moment the

417
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,030
one with the dots that you  I

418
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,050
had shown that before but I do not find

419
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,760
however there is the possibility to

420
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,920
directly enable clustering in this

421
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,340
interface here and there is a

422
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,870
library of leaflets and open layers or

423
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:58,570
perhaps only of open the year that gives no

424
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,050
because at the moment it does not  I have not notes

425
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:08,559
actually load a layer of points

426
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:14,100
to just to understand if I am capable

427
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,780
then the data is

428
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,650
then I am going to generate the idea center

429
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,680
of these of these areas here before

430
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,830
we do not even show that they are

431
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,690
basically the landslide areas that

432
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,190
you have seen before

433
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,800
I  a feature that allows me to

434
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,810
generate the centers of at this point

435
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,870
we remove what has nothing to do with this

436
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,450
point where it should give me the possibility  ability

437
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,930
for the early one to

438
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:11,910
process clustering as well here we are

439
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:18,390
visible cluster hopkins therefore ability

440
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,840
the cluster functionality we

441
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,070
always keep the beginning of why it is lighter and

442
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,410
therefore depending on the zoom level

443
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,480
years visualize this can

444
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,610
be a very simple thing

445
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,250
later  of that the possibility of making

446
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,290
actual analyzes and then going to

447
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,380
see the shopping streets

448
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,860
etc. requires a method

449
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,410
that is also quite shared, that is, the use of

450
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,330
more software generally in free software is required

451
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,040
while in the usual it is the owner

452
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,020
rightly one says I bought the

453
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,850
licenses of this product I would like

454
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,710
to also do this thing

455
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,540
in the usual book when you ask the

456
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,520
developers but I would like it

457
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,140
to also do this functionality that

458
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,880
in the other software one says well but

459
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,820
being free software or you write a

460
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,310
connector or simply since

461
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,320
you have the data from  one part project

462
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,090
on the other

463
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,370
open your other software file analis  i

464
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,340
generate the data ok so this is not

465
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,170
I like questions because very often

466
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,340
those who approach gis through cousins

467
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,200
for work matters very often

468
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,660
would like to have everything they need in this environment

469
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,960
but the approach

470
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,420
of those who use free software is  that yes

471
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,940
to contaminate etc. however the software is already very

472
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,090
heavy and maybe I would not

473
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,370
recommend it as a

474
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,920
shate viewer that is to the question one I phone

475
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,330
I found this data published in

476
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,880
shape how I open it I would answer open

477
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,810
jump

478
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,539
oh well to the defect java version

479
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,840
but more than  social farm for

480
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,600
windows however in short there are also

481
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,570
software a moment simpler

482
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:05,970
but I repeat the analysis tools for

483
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,899
example you can see then in case we see

484
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:12,330
something in detail but there

485
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,369
is clustering is used very precisely to

486
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:16,289
distinguish populations such as

487
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:18,149
mammals or ungulates  on the basis

488
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:22,729
therefore in the forestry field used very

489
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:31,470
far here it is very passionate therefore no it is

490
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,139
that in any case it acqui  sisse and

491
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:35,909
use it for example in the message because it has

492
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:37,679
an excellent client to modify the data

493
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,049
but to answer this question on the

494
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:42,570
cast ring he needs more cult and

495
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,279
database queries so as he

496
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:48,299
said but it is an analysis there are various

497
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,700
possible algorithms no so if

498
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,830
depending on what I have to do about what I

499
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,349
have to do klaus peering if actually

500
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:57,450
anisotropic and so also the opposite

501
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,789
i.e. the interpolation being able to have

502
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:02,159
from a series of values of the wells

503
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,340
interpolate the ground line behind there

504
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,229
is also some knowledge of domain

505
00:27:07,229 --> 00:27:10,080
that is needed  google has an advantage

506
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,479
that is he outlines the shopping streets

507
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:15,299
but in most of the

508
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,129
times he does so but most of the time he does not

509
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:19,769
have to account to someone for the method

510
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:22,649
used he provides a data and that

511
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,210
becomes the bible

512
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,970
so much that I am sure that if

513
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,609
indeed one  he says this street is

514
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:31,679
full of shops so

515
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,049
go shopping here

516
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:36,450
no because it is already full and even if it may

517
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,179
not be right  meanwhile, who can

518
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:40,080
deny

519
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,599
it by not having google data because the

520
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:45,210
data detected by google which, as

521
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,009
you know, is largely generated by

522
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:50,639
mobile phones thanks to the consent or

523
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:55,769
even the non-consent of users even

524
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:57,960
against the will of users but

525
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,239
none to those  data to be able to generate

526
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:02,009
the same process various with another

527
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:02,880
common software

528
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,560
another algorithm so another

529
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,240
very important thing for the

530
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,220
research area where I work is to use

531
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,050
free software allows you to

532
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,700
publish a paper and anyone can

533
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,040
redo all the steps because  if not

534
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,990
otherwise you risk saying yes we

535
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,790
have entered the data in this

536
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,490
proprietary software we have applied

537
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,140
the xy algorithm and we have this the

538
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,380
result maybe there is a bug that on

539
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,330
tobacconists since the name is too

540
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,970
long does not consider the dimension i

541
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,520
square meters of the shop and so on and

542
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,030
therefore it turns out that the survey is

543
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:41,630
completely lacking in tobacconists

544
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,620
and therefore if one wants to  and such a

545
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,300
thing is very fun to do and

546
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,160
it is not difficult if you get the data

547
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,050
from the open street map for example because

548
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,790
they have everything they have the shops with the

549
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,340
VAT numbers with the address how many floors

550
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,490
to that shop with 6 at the exact end

551
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,040
even 23  excellent data source open street

552
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,110
map that has the advantage that I can

553
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,150
modify it that is if something is missing I know

554
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,480
that I can insert the and then the withdrawal

555
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,240
out shot clearly typed

556
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,840
st cousins of the direct connectors for

557
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,070
open street map

558
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,940
oh well which I launched a bit too

559
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,250
long  so if it is planted, however,

560
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,710
I can have both the background and the

561
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,510
data available also the known

562
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,830
street data but you are hungry no one more

563
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,810
question thanks as it weighs the

564
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:36,180
data pack of the Veneto region that is all not very

565
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,760
much are at a 3 terabyte that is on the

566
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,140
server  the sea is not there no

567
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,470
impossible things in short these files that

568
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,690
you have seen most of the time one

569
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,790
that is the servant himself asks to download them at

570
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,940
the provincial or municipal level in short

571
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,680
then  i just like network cher i

572
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,540
remember more or less this thing here

573
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,120
so i don't know they are not very heavy

574
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,170
after

575
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,290
which the veneto region has the

576
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,810
institutional task of providing the basic map

577
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,940
then we saw the soil map and

578
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,190
made by arpav for example because it is a

579
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:14,100
given  fundamental for pollution for

580
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,750
the management of pollution etc.

581
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,960
but the data producers are many there

582
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,260
are many here is attention for example

583
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,940
to the Ispra data which are often

584
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,540
mosaic of data made by others and

585
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,720
therefore we have a single card that is convenient to

586
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,240
see but in reality  in Liguria

587
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,460
a method has been used to perimeter landslides

588
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,690
and in Calabria

589
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:41,190
maybe there is nothing but then you

590
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,070
have to go back to

591
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,470
discover how weight what weighs so much

592
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,740
are the satellite images the orthophotos

593
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,390
so that yes in the sense that

594
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,950
needing  a lot of resolution but the

595
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,000
vector data in general is also very well

596
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,760
compressible substantially so with

597
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,740
a little patience, in short, one can

598
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,450
sca  get everything from the regional portal

599
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,290
kept you can find the maps

600
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:13,200
with the umts g3 g4 g5 antennas which

601
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,020
certainly not then in part yes in the sense that

602
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,670
you must always understand who is interested

603
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,880
in mapping that data the municipality itself

604
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,670
that actually receives

605
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,070
authorization requests  should take this into account

606
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,500
in urban planning and

607
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,870
should transmit the data to the

608
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,180
region obviously use conditionally

609
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,590
because more often than not what you find

610
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,810
is a point says ok here there is an antenna

611
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:41,040
that managers are there which which which type

612
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,770
of radio base stations and which

613
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,630
power in what year

614
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,770
these things were installed here no one in risi marks

615
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:53,500
the buoys enrico you know more

616
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,900
microphone on the arpav site I understand

617
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,910
that there is a monograph for each

618
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,340
antenna where the

619
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,470
power is also marked I believe they are required to  But to do it,

620
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,710
however, that Venetian level for

621
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,860
example for which you have to be

622
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,660
good bloodhounds there are and there

623
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,150
are many and also very interesting  i

624
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,580
it is not easy to find them in the portals

625
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,240
get help ask in the list of

626
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,950
calls to the region at the arpav because

627
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,480
more often than not one gets lost

628
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,060
simply in the menu but maybe

629
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,090
they have published them in a cascade on a

630
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:37,690
hidden page because the supplier

631
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,440
was not available to integrate them at the moment

632
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,430
in the data infrastructure, that is to say, these

633
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,980
monates also happen here one must make

634
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,020
a data available quickly then

635
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,730
publish a zip

636
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,190
within the institutional website and

637
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,530
in the geoportal there is still no or one

638
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,230
that is not updated for which we must

639
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,900
insist a little but  you can find a bit of

640
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,350
everything thanks

641
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,560
we are done
