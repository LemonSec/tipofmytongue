00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:06,690
hi renzo davoli r of the 235 the nickname

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,179
that was given to me is neither the rfc because

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,719
I was among the first to have a

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,340
network node in Italy born in 1987

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,340
and then all the

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,519
network administrators had nicknames of this genius

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,710
attributed to them  from the pentagon so

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,590
I was pleased to have this as a

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,790
link in the then today's top is

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,820
deliberately disorganized because it wants

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,390
to meet your

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,190
interest in a dialogue that I will

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,879
tell you about my activities both

14
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,020
let's say more advanced and therefore

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,510
already implemented  available both those

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,260
and let's say the developments we are

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,329
doing with the virtual square group at

18
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,780
this moment in the post let's talk about

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,920
virtuality we try to give an

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,070
operational idea of virtuality after all

21
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,290
what is virtual given any

22
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,750
service object to a service an object at

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,479
first  made in a different way from a

24
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,030
that can effectively be used

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,700
instead of a we call it a virtual

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,920
so if we take a piece  or of memory

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,939
plus a piece of disk and with various me here

28
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,770
method if we pretend to have a

29
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,840
larger memory we have virtual memory

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,290


31
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,229
in particular our

32
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,710
historical warhorses are virtual networks and

33
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,930
partial

34
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,960
virtualization virtual networks well you know what

35
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,290
a  virtual machine with the definition

36
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,830
then above for us computer scientists a

37
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,959
machine is nothing more than something is

38
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,840
arcola software we don't care

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,900
that it speaks an extended iso that is it speaks the

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,430
machine language of the processor plus the

41
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,770
language of the tail of the

42
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,209
peripherals

43
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,100
if we can recreate  some

44
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,140
other way something that speaks the same

45
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,880
language we manage to make fun of

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,940
an upper layers

47
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,290
interfacing and then the

48
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,270
OS is overjoyed different on a

49
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,890
machine but it doesn't know that machine

50
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,170
is not true

51
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,630
now one of the problems of

52
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,270
virtual machines and  connect them to the network because if you

53
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,230
take a cable with a socket there is the 45

54
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,670
you do not know where to put it in one

55
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,610
virtual machine and therefore I play force

56
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,050
if you have a virtual machine

57
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,120
on the other side you must have a

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,860
virtual network that talks to the virtual machine and

59
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:03,440
historically they existed many

60
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,930
times often using a

61
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,510
code written by enny casper os that many

62
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,690
years ago

63
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,210
called network emulator  slip

64
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,610
that makes the virtual machine

65
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,420
pretend to see your real network

66
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,030
through this emulator for some time

67
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,020
since I lost I don't remember what

68
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,850
year we did it we had

69
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,710
proposed myrtle distributed fernet with

70
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,450
the acronym vite and l  'acronym says a lot it

71
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,470
is a virtual business to attack

72
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,760
virtual machines it is an ethernet it is

73
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,240
because if you want to do something

74
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,650
virtual that is very usable

75
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,530
you have to redo it to what is real

76
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,020
very centered now the de facto standard

77
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,730
on local networks and the  isomet so if

78
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,760
you come up with something that as before for the

79
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,709
virtual machine has the same

80
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:18,480
interface, the same dialog and in the

81
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,488
same way as the  real lieutenant you get

82
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:22,440
that you carry everything that

83
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,330
ends up working on a real

84
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,490
distributed internet here is a word that sounds a

85
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,410
bit like a stimulus saying

86
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:37,230
distributed internet but internet and local the idea

87
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,390
was to initially realize

88
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,880
those that are the most elements in the

89
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,540
ternet fat  with virtual elements therefore it

90
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,220
exists but the internet switches existed

91
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,000
gladly of the cable and the virtual machines

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,070
connected to the suites

93
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,560
the problem is that a cable was made

94
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,640
up of two wire plates exactly like a

95
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,610
cable your plates were software that

96
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,780
could be attached to us with the  wire

97
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,229
is nothing more than a stream a bidirectional stream of

98
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:19,979
bytes therefore using

99
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,530
national beppe plates which can

100
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,620
be tunneling dsa which can be neither head

101
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,020
nor if what you think you could

102
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,430
make long cables at will that

103
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,229
also crossed the continent if you

104
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:34,530
liked  you could create this

105
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,830
infrastructure liked the idea so much that it

106
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,140
was adopted and is currently supported

107
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,160
by  machines like that cows vm

108
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,120
virtualbox

109
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:59,099
I know what linux but let's say no I was not

110
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:03,780
happy we had to go further then

111
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,310
what

112
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,770
those are let's say for the latest

113
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:14,580
evolutions we see for example from these

114
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,570
transparencies that I used to the foster woody and 4

115
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,090
which is not yet packaged the via

116
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,860
lo  we will soon say

117
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,750
packaged some plans in others but

118
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,979
only the distribution changes the idea and I

119
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,800
was inspired in the idea by these

120
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,580
connectors which know the smurf small

121
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,080
form factor spa socket and pluggable

122
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,349
socket that is they are sockets finds

123
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,300
a deal that is not inserted  a plug

124
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,700
but it is a converter that makes it possible

125
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,610
to use different supports and therefore

126
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,370
you have a generic street and you can

127
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,349
put fiber

128
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:00,860
connections copper connections what you

129
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,430
love

130
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,340
the idea was this we apply the

131
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,630
same concept audi and we have a

132
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,520
program compatible with udine for

133
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,370
example that ibm so that those spoke

134
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,990
rai and will be able how to speak which

135
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,280
means but instead of putting  and the old

136
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,490
connector we put the conductor on the

137
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,680
china bill and then it means that we

138
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,830
can attach these machines a

139
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,030
series of network implementations

140
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,950
that what we like best

141
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,840
ok and to do this to

142
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,660
identify the type of plugin we have

143
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,610
invented a kind of  vrl for example

144
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,680
put it colon barabara as a

145
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,690
descriptor of the network you get the network

146
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,820
nothing that throws away everything it

147
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,390
receives you will never need a useless packet

148
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,960


149
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,000
in reality no sometimes you also need the one

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,430
like the venus must how many times you

151
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,410
use it

152
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,110
or you can connect to the old vd

153
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,480
suite  of the generation where you can

154
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,950
connect a tap

155
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,960
but there are some great news you can

156
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,570
have plugins that are

157
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,060
themselves strips as if you attach to

158
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,280
that socket of the street but virtual

159
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,250
attack another switch ok you can

160
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,240
cremona I'm interested in arriving

161
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,480
let's

162
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,380
start with a classic problem  you

163
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,289
have in your company in your

164
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:48,360
datacentre many boxes many

165
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,650
fis machines  who run the only

166
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,210
operating system that makes sense to

167
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,980
run in these contexts which are

168
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,670
called linux and you have these many

169
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,030
machines you have to run many

170
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,830
virtual machines on these

171
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,810
physical machines but you want to connect the

172
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,790
virtual machine that is on physical machine

173
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,270


174
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,510
1

175
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,100
with a virtual machine that is on

176
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,200
machine 2 and these must be

177
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,900
connected from a network by a wlan and

178
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,810
instead you have other machines that even for

179
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,720
example of several of your customers

180
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,370
admits some customers who have ten

181
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,960
machines scattered around our data

182
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,030
center others currently like  you would

183
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,870
currently have to install on the

184
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,680
machines some virtual switches attached

185
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,680
on the machines what is called the step

186
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,760
of the hotel weeks lan

187
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,880
put us we did xdxd is a

188
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,790
phase that allows the virtual machine to

189
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:09,610
connect using the idea is the network mind

190
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:15,070
the english proverb best  of that work

191
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,260
the birds that have the same have more

192
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,530
but they do the storm suit practically

193
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,820
you just need to give 3 to the machines you

194
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,170
want to be part of

195
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,640
the same wlan the right of many cast

196
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,060
ip and those will connect by themselves

197
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,860
you do not have to configure wlan and the

198
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,600
espressos in the gloomy choral the local money is

199
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,390
enough only for what

200
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,310
we practically use  because he knows wlan

201
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:51,220
the idea of wlan basically you can use

202
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,550
the ip multicast packets as the

203
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,430
broadcast packets of the effects when

204
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,230
I send them they all said so and therefore

205
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:05,710
when I have an obama broadcast packet a

206
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,670
non resse plans for multicast I send it

207
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,050
with multiclass but sending to the  my

208
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,850
multicast and dating side sees

209
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,000
door and feet to the sender and therefore

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,980
all packages and social as one did

211
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,830
when he knows the door the parts

212
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,080
send them

213
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,360
well if you want you search there are

214
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,290
articles around but the result is that

215
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,440
we go as fast as  vxx lana need

216
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,900
configuration this no ok but still

217
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,440


218
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,740
not there it was not enough for us yet oh well I have

219
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,560
admitted encryption for those who want it

220
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,680
we have all  the possibilities

221
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,130
but the nice thing is to be able to have instead

222
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,089
of starting an entire virtual machine

223
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,310
if you only need an insolation

224
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,220
isolation as regards the network

225
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,310
to be able to start a namespace with

226
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,360
the espace that isolates the network and keeps

227
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,390
everything else

228
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,420
in the  environment of the real machine that is

229
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:32,320
to say if I can migrate to

230
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,510
another screen here is v dns want to

231
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,920
close two points

232
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,520
barbara here I entered a in a

233
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,150
main stage

234
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,310
what you see in the ready is another

235
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,589
project called is called kato

236
00:12:52,589 --> 00:13:00,760
sono  it is necessary to have the ability to do

237
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,030
what you do with sestu at the level of k

238
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,490
veneti cadeau eca 6 you educate children

239
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,800
anyway there I am a normal user

240
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,330
night that we for our projects

241
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,010
we do not want to have to do with the

242
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,540
prerogatives of administrator because for

243
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,150
we is dangerous it means that you can

244
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,540
make

245
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,670
a mistake and change the configuration

246
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,730
the legal network interfaces instead I am

247
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,780
a user

248
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:38,860
now here black the network I think is only

249
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,070
done like this for example I can add

250
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,450
an ip address

251
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:52,510
obviously it is not th 0 but wlan votes 00

252
00:13:52,510 --> 00:14:00,000
on the interface same thing I do

253
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,340
woody nsx colon barbara here the only

254
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,650
thing I have to do

255
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:18,030
obviously give a different ip address

256
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,439
if your co admit 1

257
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,790
and  here I obviously copied the

258
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:33,430
wrong command and pelling set futile 0

259
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:42,160
ap ping 10 0 0 2 and the other yes but

260
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,960
I did this on the same machine I could

261
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,340
do it on any machine I have

262
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,730
girl on the local network and it would have

263
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,800
done a network of  dead space and now it says

264
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,770
but what if I want to connect the

265
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,570
virtual machines because I have to use

266
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,440
in the spaces but because you want for example to

267
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,850
put on wifi to see the packets

268
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,660
that pass you can do many beautiful things

269
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,410
but not only

270
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,039
[Music] it

271
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,810
is also possible to do a  in

272
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,899
connected space that has more

273
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:25,839
direct virtual interface and those you can do

274
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,310
what is called network fans

275
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,360
virtualization

276
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,550
if you want to put also a virtual

277
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,699
squared because you have this spac  and

278
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,319
then you do not need anything of

279
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:36,699
the physical machine of a

280
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:39,279
virtual machine but simply a space and you

281
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,350
can make them work all the

282
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,930
firewall algorithms routing

283
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,120
paquette shaping all you want

284
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,449
and that is what is working is

285
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,850
kernel code that is working in  one

286
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,230
space so fast code code that has

287
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,740
been tested for some time

288
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:12,370
ok here are but I will quickly tell you

289
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,639
other evolutions that are underway in

290
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,980
another field

291
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,829
these are virtual networks that of

292
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:22,870
partial virtual machines

293
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,730
or if you want to call call them in

294
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,620
another way

295
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,269
when it  we coined this

296
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:31,000
definition there were not yet we can

297
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,720
call them in and often container and

298
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,019
user space that is to create containers

299
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,319
that not with the support of the kernel which

300
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:45,550
is becoming more and more overabundant

301
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,040
of features and according to alcohol it is according to

302
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,370
the firewall theorem  the more it contains

303
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,240
code the more fragile it will become instead

304
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,389
bring out this functionality

305
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:02,829
ok and pot  you see the old

306
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:07,329
version umd or that allows you to

307
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,530
create machines

308
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,589
let's do an example of one the new one is

309
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:23,040
called wendy you eat stop

310
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,880
here is this hicks terme that I launched

311
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,010
is inside a partial virtual machine

312
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,200
this means that you can do

313
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,210
everything here  you do

314
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,830
inside a real machine, however,

315
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,770
you can add modules to

316
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:47,070
virtualize what file system device

317
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:53,220
network well-formed and many other beautiful things

318
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,920
let's do an example an example

319
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,750
a user is thirsty and you have a file that the

320
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,220
disk image of one of yours  virtual machine

321
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,150


322
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:15,280
ok and you want to change the contents of a

323
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,240
file within a file system

324
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,910
in the virtual machine image

325
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,610
as it is done today one way you

326
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:30,040
use to do it is by ruth monti has to

327
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,230
jump through hoops to partition home

328
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,910
there is a command whose

329
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,690
name I always forget

330
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,940
then you have to mount the file system and you

331
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,830
back and at that point you can modify it

332
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:48,790
well you are now doing tronchet bardet

333
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,050
bajrama  j disk

334
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:04,480
one jig ok no no bar time bar

335
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,679
ok i made an empty danzig file now i

336
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:13,660
bio in smat

337
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,370
i ask him give me the form to have oe

338
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:23,350
says e virtual and then this already

339
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,510
includes fec ruth can do what is

340
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:36,730
called rootkit ch ruth  then let's put b

341
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:42,100
hotel and bio fuel so you have to be

342
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,640
current virtual fest well now the

343
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,309
de.co but mount no I have to be root to

344
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:56,500
mount these are broken but sony

345
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,770
broke of the virtual machine of

346
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,580
the virtual container at this point

347
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:15,870
I mount less team of  youtube parts

348
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:22,480
bar time never disk in barat the hut

349
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,799
of ha then but beware this bardem has

350
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,630
the ball falls and will only see this

351
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,620
process see it only here those you

352
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,470
see partial virtualization

353
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:44,039
what always I can do german

354
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:49,430
barbara cadia let's

355
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,530
do a simple thing  let's make a

356
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,030
file system that we have only one

357
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,510
partition at this point I do mks

358
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:12,230
slash thanks mk fez ex 234 whatever you

359
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,380
like

360
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:21,400
2 slash at this point hd to 1

361
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,820
ea  now obviously ls paramount is empty

362
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:35,300
I do mount less tmm hughes ex 2

363
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,710
bar bar hd to 1 in dance mm I

364
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:48,470
owe less or rw more what have I done

365
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,590
wrong

366
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,140
[Music]

367
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,830
help

368
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:08,960
to understand allowed that this for some

369
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:22,460
reason obviously is no let's see  if it is a

370
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:30,220
problem of this which is strange anyway

371
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,200
violet and the last development here until

372
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,140
before worked having access to the

373
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,679
file system could modify it now

374
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:48,670
anyway i stay around here and what

375
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,170
not why should

376
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,920
a is here the error om the package

377
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,830
old version of the old version the one no

378
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,030
clearly is called vio

379
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,720
here here it is

380
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,270
sorry since he used for years the

381
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,710
old version which was called imb

382
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,970
instead no

383
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,570
and here I can change the files and

384
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,650
then I do it as a user I have not not

385
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,200
corrupted think I tremble all the  times

386
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,880
that I have to do those things at the level of

387
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,590
rottweil he just knows that he has place of accidia

388
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:44,920
1 and write it sda1 and I am ruined is

389
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,190
something that makes you laugh but you think he thought

390
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,610
like security experts

391
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,710
this thing security does not only

392
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,100
mean that the correct packets arrive

393
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,930
as the networks sent I want to

394
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,230
go but also wants lire does not put

395
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,000
the system at risk when there is no

396
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,280
need anymore I make a last comment

397
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,260
saying this business here that is the  module

398
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,200
that virtualizes and fascist the module that

399
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,060
virtualizes look a lot like servers

400
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,650
and microkernel so going ahead on

401
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,950
this path allows you to no longer have

402
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,170
the monolithic kernel and

403
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,200
microkernel quality but allows you to have

404
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,380
monolithic parts microkernel parts and

405
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,680
be able to migrate tomorrow maybe we would have

406
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,960
everything to  micro carne so also ton obama

407
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,090
is happy but we can migrate now I

408
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,120
called him a thousand kernels many

409
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,400
songs he called it eni kernel but the idea is

410
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,380
that if you can make a transfer a

411
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,070
gradual change and not only but it is

412
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,690
added to the minister and o can  deciding

413
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,640
what she needs flexibility for

414
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,380
treats her

415
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,300
what she needs for performance

416
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,240
stolen dog but a rich and functional  or

417
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,560
all the devices you have

418
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,410
because you always have the monolithic backup

419
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:17,580
today micro which type l4 but a little less but they

420
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,100
are laboratory toys because

421
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,690
if you want to use microcars you have to

422
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,950
take that motherboard as a

423
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,230
processor so we have a

424
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,010
way out

425
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,400
I stop no  I take time away from who I see that

426
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,300
speaking after me

427
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,620
questions

428
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,150
comes the micro never has a problem it is the

429
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,940
flame recording then the pd and 4

430
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,320
will also have the possibility to do

431
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,350
encryption you suggested at the beginning

432
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,510
at this point think about doing an

433
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,840
extension in addition to the network  local also

434
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,630
a network go or not to

435
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,640
actually bypass the bpn in fact it is possible to

436
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,470
do using in the cables connect instead

437
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,960
connect connected machines local networks

438
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,880
correct local you have a data center

439
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,790
which tends to center you can make the

440
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:25,120
tunnel that connects all the vpn together

441
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,450
and for  the encryption we have what

442
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,660
are called the nets one so the

443
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,430
encryption we have not presented as

444
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,040
a way the part you put af  Other

445
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,690
in the meter between the plugin that you put

446
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,090
in the virtual or author machine

447
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,460
you want to come and start

448
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,000
the part you have and put the plugin

449
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,860
for the network technology you

450
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,290
want implemented and we call it

451
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,020
agnostic encryption because it doesn't give a

452
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,700
damn  what is happening

second question he said that it

455
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,120
will soon be integrated in debian

456
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,740
as are the predictions

457
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,980
the problem is that

[Music]

459
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,090
there is me who work on a project and many

460
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,220
others who are my students who wander

461
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,530
around the  world but we do not have great

462
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,300
funding and those remain

463
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,480
anchored to the project because since they have

464
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,580
contributed to the code they feel it as then

465
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,920
to their son as once you have a

466
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,810
code written thank goodness it remains tied

00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,370
we are trying to make parts as soon as

468
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,880
possible and they have already entered the

469
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,900
biggest problem is now it's yes like

470
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,600
woody and 4 we don't have the same part i

471

have to say 2

472
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,160
need to separate the old p  packages

473
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,290
under packages to make sure that there

474
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,380
is only partial package collision

475
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,450
to allow you to also have

476
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,250
the old suite so we

477
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,180
need to study the steps but I don't

478
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,890
dare to make predictions but we are

479
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:11,900
working hard to do it other

480
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,050
questions

481
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,779
however I remain  around if you want

482
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:22,690
dem live maybe searched around
