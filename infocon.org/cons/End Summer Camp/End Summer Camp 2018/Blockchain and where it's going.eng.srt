1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,659
hi we are here to introduce you to a

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,660
project that my friend and I did

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,450
because I have to apologize I am

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,570
sebastian biollo I am antonio grossa

5
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,119
beginning i explaining this project that

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,980
concerns blocks in eclipse beijing for

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,190
those who do not know what blog chain is a

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,350
database  for the recording of

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,500
transactions or or anything that

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,879
concerns a datum this datum is

11
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,969
inserted inside a block and each block

12
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,800
foresees the part of a datum is of one and of

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,570
two axes there is a unique scene on tv to

14
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,040
identify an object and this makes

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,979
it takes possible to create a chain of

16
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:14,490
a chain of blocks connected and

17
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:24,689
so connected 11 after the other without them

18
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,530
being necessarily sequential if

19
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,979
for example and leaves the first of the

20
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,290
block before it is different

21
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,140
the block is not accepted and

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,619
in addition to this data are saved  and

23
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,700
transactions and smart contracts but what

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,130
are smart contracts are

25
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,509
simply contracts that

26
00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:02,060
are digital so they are used

27
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,299
to do  of agreements between people

28
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:12,269
as an example it may be that a

29
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:14,280
person wants to do a project and there

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,739
are lenders then the lenders

31
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,319
put the money into a smart

32
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,239
contract which is a small program

33
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,019
inserted into the blog chain and to the

34
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,849
realization of the project

35
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:29,340
this money  from the smartphone between which

36
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,730
are passed to the developer,

37
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,870
however, if the developer does not reach

38
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,700
the goal, this money is

39
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,250
returned to who knows who and

40
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,660
who has put it in the smart contrast

41
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,450
now I will talk a little about the

42
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,599
most recent innovations in the world

43
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,329
of  'net effect and that can be

44
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:02,280
divided into three categories mainly

45
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,500
the shard ying which basically divides

46
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,079
the block chain into many smaller block chains

47
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,569
so that not everyone has to

48
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:12,209
know all the blocks but you can

49
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,280
only know a part of the network and

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,430
still be safe  integrity

51
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,069
then the prof ostrich which is an

52
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,709
alternative system to decide the blocks and is

53
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,120
much more  faster

54
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,209
better from an energy point of view

55
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,390
web assemblies which is another way to

56
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,659
write these smart contracts is much

57
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:37,330
simpler than the already existing solutions

58
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,620


59
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,280
therefore the shard ying the shard ying

60
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,159
practically divides the networks into

61
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,459
smaller pieces and allows you to communicate between

62
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:51,579
the  one and the other allows many more

63
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,110
transactions per second the problem

64
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,730
so club the oECD is that since

65
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,660
everyone has to see everything is a lot because

66
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,799
these blocks are limited in

67
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,329
size it is very difficult to put

68
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,060
enough transactions to satisfy

69
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,870
everyone

70
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,650
so dividing it into smaller pieces

71
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,519
would make  It is possible to have many

72
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,418
meditation according to the negative side, however,

73
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:18,970
is that to make the attacks 5

74
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,829
percent structure for the prof work or

75
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,530
to the trocar for the plus you are much more

76
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,510
feasible because instead of having the

77
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,240
majority the whole network it is enough to have it

78
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,550
on a better piece to  explain the

79
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,860
shard ying must explain these

80
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,920
data structures

81
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,390
this here is a merckle thre  and

82
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,650
practically a merc oltri allows to

83
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,690
efficiently prove the presence

84
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,970
of a node within a tree it

85
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,370
works chando in pairs of nodes with

86
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,300
each other

87
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,640
until there is a slash to those

88
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,930
is called mercosud this

89
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,150
simplified drawing of a  blocking

90
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,460
collage harding so on the side we have

91
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,330
two shards in the middle we have the main

92
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,150
one practically a series of ghetti

93
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,790
collector nodes for each block they publish

94
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:19,220
main solutions this merckle 3 yes

95
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,130
and then if I want to send money

96
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,440
from the first shard to the second shard

97
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,420
as I do I publish one  transaction

98
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,090
on the first shard and I wait for

99
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,760
a block to be included then fired on the

100
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,430
second shard which publishes a proof that

101
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,260
that transaction was included in

102
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,090
a block is that with the

103
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,570
direct transaction the streaks hard at that point the

104
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,820
second shard will be saved leaving the

105
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,480
transaction as  burned to not be

106
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,980
able to reuse it twice and they

107
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,800
will give me the coins on the other sort and

108
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,820
all this sen  za create so many

109
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:03,590
transactions on the main cin then

110
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,910
oh well the consensus is a very

111
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,840
important problem in the sina blog because how

112
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,940
do you decide what the real block is if

113
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,539
everyone can propose blocks

114
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:19,280
there are three main solutions to

115
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,220
this problem currently workforce

116
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:28,400
take ep btf that  however I will not explain the

117
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:28,970


118
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,060
first app for work and it is the one currently

119
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,520
used for the largest blocks for

120
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,289
example bitcoin zero and museum prof work

121
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:40,130
and it works so you do a nas of a

122
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,819
block header is one night and who

123
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:48,289
can find  a rush that is less

124
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,680
than a difficulty of a number that is

125
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,770
decided by the networks then takes that

126
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,610
accepted block a penalty is given to

127
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,560
anyone who has found this solution

128
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,289
this system however is not ideal because

129
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,400
it uses a lot of current as

130
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,560
it is very profitable to undermine  these

131
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,159
kryptonite a lot of people started

132
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:16,159
developing asik and also for ethereal

133
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:19,159
musano today more normal from computer and

134
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:20,900
this uses a lot of  current for

135
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,360
example the current consumption of eternal is

136
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,479
more or less the same as in venezuela is

137
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,849
this here is a big problem then it is

138
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,889
centralized because the people who to the

139
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:33,710
resources to have these farms to

140
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,409
find ash to a great incentive to

141
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:39,289
trade more for the  economies of scale

142
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:41,780
so if I invest if someone else

143
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,669
invests my capital twice he

144
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:46,990
will have more than twice the

145
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,169
return on his investment and then another

146
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:52,460
very important factor is the cost of

147
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,770
electricity so all these miners will

148
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,659
put themselves more or less in the  same

149
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,340
geographic area to take advantage of the

150
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,130
current which is cheap

151
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,430
the second method and prof state in which the

152
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,020
various nodes

153
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,449
practically ice money must

154
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,060
follow rules generate

155
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,770
blocks make votes depends on the

156
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,560
implementation in exchange for this

157
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,860
service they are paid by the network a

158
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,020
quantity  even quite small for

159
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,300
example in the current implementation of

160
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,360
the room they think they are about 3

161
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,590
percent an  nual return

162
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,890
on investment

163
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,740
then they are much more

164
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,120
energy efficient because you don't have to

165
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,450
do so many ashe is much faster

166
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,000
because you don't have to wait until I know

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,130
15 minutes like visconti for a block

168
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,040
then seconds like born in rome but you

169
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,480
can spend a lot of time.

170
00:08:50,480 --> 00:09:02,450
block time like 3 seconds no this is and

171
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,670
how the group works state in a nutshell

172
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,850
there are people who deposit

173
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,910
money on block chaining these

174
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,959
people are defined as validators the

175
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,250
groups of these groups of validators

176
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,370
[Music]

177
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,820
do they make us have their own

178
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,149
internship or not really value

179
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,860
in the blog chain based on the money

180
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,300
they put in and have more money they

181
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,870
put in more globality year of being taken

182
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,720
in to create a new block and creating

183
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,839
a new jury award block of money and

184
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,320
so more more money minds  more to the

185
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,520
incentive to stay in the blog chain

186
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,050
to accumulate more and more money

187
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,360
also there are also votes

188
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,200
to decide when to stop q  hen

189
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,390
accept that up to a certain point that

190
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,300
part of the block chain is valid and must

191
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,820
have a consent of at least two thirds of

192
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,750
all these validators and

193
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,050
if there are false votes

194
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,060
there are slash conditions that

195
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,080
reduce your money

196
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,370
because of  violated these rules

197
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,400
then the smartphone trucks practically

198
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,000
all

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,300
currently the main block that

200
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,920
supports smart contracts and the room

201
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,890
and ethereal currently uses its own

202
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,990
via m for contracts is called and on

203
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,390
admit a virtual machine is

204
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,850
a 256-bit virtual machine and

205
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,620
currently  supports two

206
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,029
main programming languages that are

207
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:00,170
usual vipers since this vm is so

208
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,870
different it is quite difficult to bring

209
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,070
old compilers to this one,

210
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,710
however, reinventing the wheel that

211
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,350
programmers have to get used to a

212
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,150
new language to install a new

213
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,920
compiler and everything  'winter by

214
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,260
new boxing however we

215
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,790
believe this thing

216
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,550
brenda much more there  olenta the adoption of

217
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,380
this technology and therefore in

218
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,570
our yes in our implementation

219
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,710
we use web assembly then the assembly is

220
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,130
nothing more than a very simple way

221
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,180
designed to be performed inside the

222
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,230
browsers was developed by group fu

223
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,800
3 there goes well but the positive side  is that it

224
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,510
is already supported by many

225
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,250
programming languages for example

226
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,900
you can write smart contracting

227
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,160
those languages haskell java I have not

228
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,490
tested it but it therefore makes the

229
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,080
toll barrier much lower

230
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,870
now if the ping allows you to do a

231
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,170
demo

232
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:21,610
then this here

233
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:34,160
this here also for god this here is a

234
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,290
contract that I had written in time

235
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,149
that a language very similar to sky

236
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:41,209
script that does a very simple thing

237
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:43,069
practically it is sport is a

238
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:46,160
function called claim that calls bile

239
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,829
by the boxing user and what it does

240
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,899
practically it saves the value of the

241
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:52,370
transaction

242
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,199
checks if the value of the transaction

243
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:57,559
is greater than the maximum that ever received

244
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,809
and if not  n is maximum cancels the

245
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:00,699
whole operation

246
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:03,439
if greater than the maximum sets the

247
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:05,959
owner of this contract to

248
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,569
whoever sent it and then pays the old

249
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:11,029
maximum to the new owner

250
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:13,309
and then there are two functions here empty

251
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:17,769
to show the parsing

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,730
that is mine  contract that I have

253
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,520
compiled in a file or passages I do not

254
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:57,230
see this here

255
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,040
so this that my contract that

256
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,760
so maybe practically in the door from

257
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,500
the vm of the functions and then it sports

258
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,870
the others and then does the operations in

259
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,990
real estate

260
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,050
then once this contract

261
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,920
a node is activated

262
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,829
and when

263
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,079
we wait a

264
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,580
while ago they confronted me on another

265
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:53,300
terminal which of the three we are here the two

266
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,110
will be essentially the same they are a little bit

267
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,480
this below which gives ok for now

268
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,090
those there are empty blocks that

269
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,520
contain previous blush nothing  'more

270
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,070
we can see that they also arrive on

271
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,679
this other node and now I will try to make

272
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,190
a transaction and at eboli it is to upload

273
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,710
a contract on the singh blind

274
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:28,850
i blog  nteractive di transaction ok so

275
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,990
now I am doing a transaction

276
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,210
using the wallet test at

277
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,660
that address

278
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,910
ok fixed iso in valence perfect jump

279
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,780
you want empty

280
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:59,399
no but test flavor 22

281
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,230
now you can see that

282
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,000
the transaction came from here and that it is

283
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,370
included in the block  after and you can see

284
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,600
that the gender balance that changes and

285
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,000
will also receive some subsequent blocks

286
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,740
if normal but the

287
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,530
most interesting function of mine

288
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,080
here is that I can load contracts

289
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,639
so here

290
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,480
ok here I make a transaction but

291
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,910
together with the transaction I also add

292
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:51,870
a contract  hoping that it goes

293
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,690
ok perfect here you can see

294
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,260
the address of the contract which then

295
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,870
deterministic so even in the

296
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,340
terminal that makes the tradition it is very

297
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,000
easy to determine it now yes now I take

298
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,230
this address and go from here I can

299
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,130
interact with the contract so I should

300
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,540
stop local

301
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,379
I miss the  bill

302
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,230
we are head

303
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,090
thanks

304
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,010
no that is not gone because the wolf does not go

305
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,040
right I do another pr  oposta not top up

306
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,420
them to I'm stupid used the

307
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,620
user's wallet

308
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,830
that's why I didn't give oh well this point

309
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:16,880
is the internet to a maxi that goes well she did

310
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,950
n't mind I was with a second of ping

311
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:27,350
but ok finally that

312
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,200
perfect transaction

313
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,520
I contract here everything is beautiful

314
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,580
remotely directed yes no

315
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,930
now a simple left active to

316
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,850
interact with this contract I can

317
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,690
call for example exec amy it will

318
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,940
list mine the inter has the functions that are

319
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,400
included in the contract that if we

320
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,870
look at its people are those three that I had

321
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,440
put I can select them terminal

322
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,360
wrong I can select one

323
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,860
insert how much to send with this

324
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,370
transaction and then lean the network and

325
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,140
execute it I think they pay

326
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,070
I avoid gravity

327
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,580
I don't want to care a node that

328
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,530
then puts to another function for example

329
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,840
memory that prints to an extra but  then

330
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,940
of the memory of the contract and here

331
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,650
we can see what has saved from the

332
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,090
contract in this case since it has

333
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,470
never been followed not yet s  if

334
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,960
nothing is raised and then also the global ones which are

335
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,300
a slightly different concept on lowerable

336
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,730
but they do for the same thing

337
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,120
and in any case if for now it supports more or

338
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,600
less 45 transactions per second that more or

339
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,470
less twice we teramo but this does

340
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,650
it via icbi proposals  making a trade off

341
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,490
of centralization in must save

342
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,320
many many more blocks and therefore

343
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,570
takes up more space but for now

344
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:34,129
it could not get worse

345
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,700
you have questions

346
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:52,830
you feel yes you have more or less answered me

347
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,779
before but I wanted to hear it another better

348
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:57,989
then this is  a vm that runs that

349
00:24:57,989 --> 00:24:59,009
performs chord there is practically

350
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:01,470
distributed on an note exactly as

351
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,549
she of m

352
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:05,159
the main difference is the language

353
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,999
used is the prof. sa work perfume proposals

354
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,730
that used or there is

355
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,690
something else ok an excellent question the avm

356
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,279
changed it because we don't have the resources

357
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,710
to invent our compilers and

358
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,059
because the etm programming language

359
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,009
sucks enough

360
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:27,299
then change the stake approach we have an

361
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,769
arc  hitettura quite different dates

362
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:32,190
straight rom but this tendency to

363
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,399
reinvent the wheel for example when

364
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:38,129
you have decided to switch to web

365
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:40,289
assembly perversion future we have

366
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,970
kept a standard pm but they are

367
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:45,090
implemented of their of their cod

368
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,299
or what do I know to send a

369
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,249
message between two nodes

370
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:53,029
their function is implemented to marshal

371
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:54,659
while we are prot

372
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,340
therefore we are much more

373
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:04,710
standardized and then we prof steak and e

374
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,320
casper cas for the implementation of

375
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,659
proposed ideas we

376
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:13,070
have been theorized we have implemented it before them

377
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,090
now l  'we had it was not really

378
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,789
good because the contracts go from hours

379
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:20,460
ago more or less

380
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,750
but yes oh well other questions

381
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:30,240
I don't know if answered from the safety point of view

382
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,960


383
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,790
we have seen that heather hume has had

384
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,800
a lot of star safety problems

385
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,460
as they say  by default not

386
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,970
exactly optimal of the usual language

387
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,530
were there were problems but also in the

388
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,400
vm like your vm with your

389
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,070
prims  itive potentially solve

390
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,720
any security issues that

391
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,210
therion had and it's a complicated question

392
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,430


393
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:59,160
ok from a defaults point of view it is

394
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,710
much healthier because in ether to

395
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,600
invoke all functions of a

396
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,550
contract except if it

397
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,280
explicitly marks it as private us  you

398
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,200
have to do the opposite to mark them

399
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,780
explicitly as external because it

400
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,750
turned off as going into stand by

401
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:20,090
is fine so from that point of view

402
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,000
really

403
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,770
ok is fine and therefore from that point of

404
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:31,010
view true for the vm bugs from that

405
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,960
point of view and milan is enough  standard

406
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,230
much more tested in the real world

407
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,540
then the bug of the vm of hetero but here

408
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,160
you were referring it was a harris condition at

409
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,650
the standard level that does not go well and

410
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,320
therefore could with a particular in

411
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,100
our case

412
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,060
no because the whole world stops while

413
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,360
if with a  contract and so it's not that

414
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,130
you can't do weird tricks with

415
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:02,360
beautiful center so if from that

416
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,480
point of view it's better than tehran then

417
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,640
we have a vm in a language

418
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,070
between type safe programming so we

419
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,900
have no members corruption we do not have

420
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,810
today therefore also much more secure from the

421
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:18,340
point of view from that point of view
