1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
good morning everyone then me or two talks

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,370
one is about gis which is a gis a

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,800
geographic information system free software

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,349
is the best gis in circulation the most

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,230
used in short, the most accessible for a

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,510
thousand reasons practically and

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,340
let's see yes ok my name is amedeo al

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,350
fadini that is some  note about me at the

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,090
moment i

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,610
do in addition to self-employment

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,409


12
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,920


13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,620
i am a research fellow at the institute of marine sciences of the cnr here in venice and i have been dealing with gis software for ten years i

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,090


15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,100
am here also representing

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,660
geforce tasks that is  an association

17
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,850
born in 2007 precisely to

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,629
advertise, let's say

19
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:52,019
, free geographic software and geographic open

20
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:54,670
data free geographic data

21
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,120
because in the gis environment

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,320
something happened in the regis mind, however, there was a

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,989
lot of license money to

24
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,840
it both a little reduced normally that

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,540
buys a gis system and public body

26
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,500


27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,380
and is almost always slow and public also having

28
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,810
difficulty understanding what is

29
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,660
what is  he was buying quickly

30
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,660
I have 23 recycled slides that I try to

31
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,420
do quickly up to give some

32
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,600
indication, perhaps thinking of having

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,850
people who have different backgrounds in front of

34
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,190
me then whatever you

35
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,229
ask me questions or during the day we feel

36
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,810
we are here and also enrico

37
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,020
representing geforce a  gis is a

38
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,630
system in Italian territorial information system

39
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,780
composed of data,

40
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,119
software procedures and people, it also takes the

41
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:57,750
trained person to understand something about

42
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,880
the gis a theme another window has opened

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,820
but does not know but does not have much to do

44
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,750
with what it is  'it's ok

45
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,720
normally once it was said that it

46
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,000
is used as a

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,730
decision support system so I put together the

48
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,500
data in an earthly field or not in a

49
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,440
given geographical area and I

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,769
can ask questions and answers

51
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:27,910
practically this is an

52
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,070
interesting video then maybe  you will look

53
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,530
at it calmly and in 2007 with donata

54
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,230
to the association he actually said

55
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:35,829
gis

56
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:38,620
not everyone talks about gis but i  jeans

57
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,930
talk about us because in any case they are

58
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,150
used to design the roads we

59
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,010
cross, not bridges but to decide,

60
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,500
for example, the building areas are

61
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,680
irreplaceable to understand if an area at

62
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,930
hydrogeological risk or not or

63
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,480
how much the noise of an airport can affect

64
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,739
the surrounding area  and if

65
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:04,630
in the surrounding area there are for

66
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,130
example some habitats protected by the

67
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,110
ha I clearly put these

68
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,260
layers together I do some calculations and

69
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,330
they get maps that tell me

70
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,079
something no since gis talk about us

71
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,790
the data also the possibility of using a

72
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,450
gis

73
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,989
ok that is as the data  as we said

74
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,720
before about noise or protected species I

75
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,909
am informed gis and it is important that there

76
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:36,269
is an open source software that

77
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:39,000
allows me as a citizen to know those data

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,549
as much as my municipality can know them

79
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:42,659
ok

80
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,120
because if my municipality says no it does not

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,010
affect the  protected area because it

82
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,079
is more than two and a half kilometers away I

83
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,720
must have the opportunity to verify

84
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,690
if evidently  and the perimeter of the

85
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,700
protected and used area was right,

86
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,730
etc. then the inspire directive is

87
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,090
a holy hand a directive of 2007

88
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,859
which essentially requires that all

89
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,500
geographical and environmental data

90
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,389
, consequently also the basic cartography,

91
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,930
be published and available

92
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,959
online without any  cost

93
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,060
there are international organizations

94
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,940
at zero g post.it and

95
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,910
kicks it 20 for information on qg si

96
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,570
italia that also an important community

97
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,620
of people and Italian developers

98
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,240
so that is, in the world we are really

99
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,349
well represented by raina enrico as

100
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:40,410
Italian developers i cousins

101
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,650
in short, you will also find a site cousin punto.it

102
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,630
because you need a gis and what is the

103
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,820
difference with cad while cad

104
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,970
replaces interiors in drafting machine works

105
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,880
on geometries takes measurements but

106
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,860
the surface of the earth is similar to

107
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,260
a sphere and the measurements must be taken

108
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,020
according to  of spherical triangles in short,

109
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,000
here then we will see the distance

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,220
between the shortest between two points  and a great

111
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,300
circle arc and we have latitude

112
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,940
longitude shows us a point even

113
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,610
just the

114
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,759
activity of modifying the coordinates that

115
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,310
now we also get on the gps of the

116
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,270
mobile phone with the accuracies that

117
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,430
we leave alone so that they should be investigated a little

118
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,139
and we also need to know a little

119
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,930
how they also work simply to

120
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,000
go to vasco's concert and to

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
set the navigator no anyway to

122
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,569
convert those two numbers line or 12.44

123
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:48,409
and 45.84 more or less the Veneto area

124
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:52,139
into map coordinates,

125
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,840
therefore Cartesian coordinates which are xy

126
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,110
however a projection is used then

127
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,120
here there was an error ok polar coordinates

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,360
has nothing to do with it and that

129
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,669
a cartographic projection is used

130
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,400
then when I was distracted at school

131
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,439
I was there looking at the planisphere with

132
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,129
this particularly

133
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:19,139
pronounced greenland particularly large and

134
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,240
this  it happens because

135
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,780
in truth the proettes and the projection of the

136
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,289
market renault that is this cylinder here

137
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:31,630
distorc  and particularly the objects that

138
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,130
are the vertices this is an

139
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,240
interesting site that allows you to

140
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,849
check how the size

141
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:42,130
of a state changes in gori to see the

142
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,560
latitude so the countries more distant

143
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,250
from the equator have a

144
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,830
greater distortion here you can see that

145
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,740
the  real surface of africa in fact

146
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,080
also contains india china and the united states

147
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,330
while instead normally we china

148
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,419
see it maybe as big as all of it will be

149
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:04,060
because there is this deformation of

150
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,449
latitude no all clear up to

151
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:12,639
here a moment and i got messed up but  it is

152
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,590
only because

153
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,449
these are the open tabs they

154
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:22,099
also come out the previous one yes it is the

155
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:30,020
first available a little more a little more

156
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,300
than three quarters yes but he did not understand very well

157
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,969
so some links what are the

158
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:38,659
projections practically from the gis point of

159
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,379
view

160
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:42,830
all this  equations that allow us

161
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,060
to make the projection to the

162
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,199
transformation from one projection to

163
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,300
another because then we also have

164
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,560
different models of the challenges  de are

165
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,530
quite complicated calculations but in the end they

166
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,530
translate into knowing well knowing

167
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,009
a number to be entered in the software

168
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,830
no which generates a code of the type and psg

169
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,469
30 26 32 which is valid in a specific

170
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:13,669
geographical area no so for

171
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:16,969
example this was the  example what I had

172
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:20,289
said 3 2 6 3 2

173
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,409
let's try for a moment look for it that precisely

174
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:26,870
corresponds to that and the

175
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,460
reference system with which we find the

176
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,159
Istat data basically you see that it is

177
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:35,419
valid for this time zone here because

178
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,708
outside that geographical area the

179
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:40,880
projections  they are a little too big

180
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,890
then if I have to actually make a

181
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,740
map no to reach the restaurant

182
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,560
of my wedding which is the classic one

183
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,140
is the area in which I have seen maps

184
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,380
drawn more often perhaps starting

185
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,210
from poland up to a

186
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,110
remote town in the Veneto  it can also be

187
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,750
fine, however, if I use, let's say, in

188
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,130
wrong reference systems, so

189
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,710
I get an excessive distortion for

190
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,630
a map on which then f  accio pay

191
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,850
taxes then for example an

192
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,680
urban plan that defines which areas

193
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,960
can be built or not understood that it is

194
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,480
a little less well or the example

195
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,990
above on the path of a pipeline for

196
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,960
example and then understand if it affects or does not

197
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,660
affect if intercept does not intercept

198
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,710
a fault or anything else so the

199
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,860
reference system is one thing is an

200
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,100
interesting notion I am

201
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,770
very fond of gis should be considered as a

202
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,680
tool not so much as word is a

203
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,529
tool for writing texts but much

204
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:48,110
more like the alphabet and a tool  to

205
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,100
write poems

206
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,610
the dictionary so in the end what

207
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,380
I notice in the requests

208
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,230
then maybe enrico denies me is that

209
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,060
in reality there is no basic idea or

210
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,070
method on what must be done

211
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,830
by gis professionals

212
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,670
by geology students who

213
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,360
they have to use and that they put themselves there they

214
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,089
tinker they learn they make a map and

215
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:16,760
then a certain point arrives in an

216
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,660
area where they

217
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,930
no longer know how to continue no because

218
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,199
behind there is not there is no method enough

219
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:29,850
nor on this is the part if if it's

220
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,930
okay with you I would try to show you

221
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,459
something live about how the

222
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,339
program works with which I must

223
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,560
necessarily so let's

224
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,220
try to load a couple  a couple of

225
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,699
layers

226
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:56,390
and see and see how it works

227
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,970
so you make leaders difficult and then

228
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,660
eventually spend a moment together

229
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,700
at the table where we are also in the

230
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,460
afternoon and then if a

231
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,770
few people arrive that I have not seen they are yes it's

232
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,590
fine there  it is also daniele enrico ok to whom

233
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,680
you can ask for a hand on how to

234
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,620
use it on how to use qg yes

235
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,830
in short then this is ours you

236
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,450
see something no you see nothing

237
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,440
a moment I have to pass a

238
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,890
resolution a little more a little more

239
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:37,040
baby perfect well then this

240
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,400
is our interface interface of

241
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,950
kuji sanzi we also start from a new

242
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,100
project so I have a series of things and

243
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,820
I have already loaded two levels these

244
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,160
levels I do not have the room here but they

245
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,470
are  from a server so this is a

246
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,780
basic map of our area we see

247
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,910
the airport you see that as I

248
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,070
zoom or the request is made to the

249
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,480
server that

250
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,210
an image is downloaded directly to me so this

251
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,090
is fine for the background but

252
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,900
normally a given a  given gis and made

253
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,760
by a geometry is connected to that

254
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,290
geometry there are a series of attributes

255
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,570
so it might be interesting for me

256
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,930


257
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,080
to understand for example in the area where we are

258
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,870
what kind of soils there are

259
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,000
yesterday I explained that the data are

260
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,510
generally on portals  regional then both

261
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,160
the basic cartography then the

262
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,740
buildings the roads etc. which is now

263
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,310
called geotopographical db here they

264
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,170
cannot enlarge perhaps however for

265
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,480
those of the municipality of Venice there is also

266
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,220
a lot of other elements so here

267
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,070
we try to look for example soils and

268
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,930
there is  a very interesting fact that is the

269
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,820
soil map that I downloaded

270
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,040
earlier and is in vector so

271
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,500
within this project I add

272
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,589
some data  ti the essential thing that jeans

273
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:08,800
always work with a project and

274
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,870
linked data the data could be

275
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,089
modified i reload the project and

276
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:15,790
find it then or multiple projects fight

277
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,190
different it does not have a single container does not

278
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,800
have a file a single file these data

279
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,100
can be  also around so I go

280
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,020
to look for

281
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,900
the data I downloaded before and then

282
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,770
here I have a browser as a

283
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,390
date management or here are the various

284
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,260
possibilities already at a glance you can see

285
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,500
that as type and format of data

286
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,590
there are several in short there are for

287
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,810
luck of the standards even

288
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,020
then there are some problems because this

289
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,690
data is not so the soil paper

290
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,670
does not actually have a very simple format

291
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,680
however this is the

292
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,510
oldest interchange format that exists that

293
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,720
the vector data format

294
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,390
exhibits composed files at least  from

295
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:17,390
three rows that are these the pins sh

296
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,600
hicks and the dbf practically at the time

297
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,580
said in the dbs we put the table with

298
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,560
the attributes each row a g  eometry

299
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,740
in the shp we put the geometries then we

300
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,960
make a connection file the

301
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,180
structure is very similar to that of a

302
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,160
database so this is there is the

303
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,130
minimum set to be able to distribute a

304
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,170
vector data then there are a series of

305
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,890
other things that tell me  in which

306
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,510
reference is it or here there is

307
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,490
also a

308
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,120
file an index file for example at this

309
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,720
point indeed now I also see the zip

310
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,750
at this point I load the vector file

311
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:04,700
ok he also brought with him a style

312
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,070
a legend so what  it is the advantage

313
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,819
that these

314
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:13,990
polygons you see here are

315
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,410
interrogable, let's see if it is true perfect

316
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,160
they are not particularly significant

317
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,379
in the sense that the attributes are you

318
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:25,579
see them here

319
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:32,480
l 1 b2 b3 l3 of 33 l4 zr1 so you understand

320
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,680
that it is also important to understand

321
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,450
that here instead we have a  di di 3d 31 no

322
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,190
so we have various levels

323
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,790
these encodings are also a little

324
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,740
cryptic we see there is a pdf that

325
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,390
explains them to us so it is also important to understand

326
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,970
no so be stands for p

327
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,940
alluvial anura of the Brenta river di stands for

328
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,070
coastal lagoon plains then we have

329
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,490
some geologists in the room there is a geologist

330
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,550
[Laughter] it

331
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,200
could happen as he announces if there is

332
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,230
a landslide but you understand more or less more or

333
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,959
less the sense then obviously another

334
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:15,920
what

335
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,060
another level particularly

336
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,990
necessary

337
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,790
I can turn off this level

338
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,100
turn on this is trivial in short because

339
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,320
also google maps turn on for example

340
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,050
a level of bingo satellite image

341
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,870
or there are also other

342
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,150
things

343
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,250
another level certainly that

344
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,860
interests us is here I go directly to

345
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,940
load a  right vector to

346
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,410
change another level that

347
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,440
interests us is certainly the

348
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,410
administrative limits that is to understand the boundaries the

349
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,910
municipal boundaries

350
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,300
and here I have a file that I keep

351
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,130
directly so I do add

352
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,750
I close very well here already tells me that

353
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,900
he as more computers and in  how

354
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,720
relatively stupid does not know the

355
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,079
reference system to use

356
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,430
so if I go to zoom on the l  ayer I do

357
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,450
n't even know where it is

358
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,700
no this is sorry this is the

359
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,959
soil map

360
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,209
if I go to this beautiful communal air in

361
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,680
vogue a sud air actually finds

362
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,020
all the municipalities of the Veneto but they are

363
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,030
somewhere else they are very far

364
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,400
from the earth because here we have  of the

365
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,580
coordinates that should go from plus

366
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,230
90 to less than 90 north no in this case

367
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,920
we have said and 12 and 45 so they go from

368
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,900
minus 180 plus 180 and from plus 90 minus 90

369
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,590
as xy latitude longitude

370
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,110
so let's get a

371
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,790


372
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,560
more useful reference system  for a cartography that was

373
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,120
exactly the same as before

374
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,160
ok you see that the

375
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,550
municipality of Venice has changed shape and we tell him

376
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:15,530
above all that this player is a

377
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,590
reference system that I know I

378
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,380
should know from the site from which I

379
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,290
downloaded it which is 30 03 gauss  boaga fused

380
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,720
west and so here we have the

381
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,170
overlay of the layer understand that

382
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,950
I am going to change the changes I am going to

383
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,660
change their style

384
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,510
the style of the layer and decides to give

385
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,510
this polygon ac  red color

386
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,890
with a dotted line and

387
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,810
then at this point I can also

388
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,740
reactivate

389
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,110
the background the background I had before

390
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,510
let's see if it retrieves something

391
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,590
ok and then I can already have

392
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,590
something significant regarding

393
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:06,140
the soil map with the attributes

394
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,100
clearly as  attribute of each

395
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,500
municipality or the istat code is the name of the

396
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,450
municipality with the attributes I can

397
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,660
also add labels to my map

398
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,059
and then a moment we get

399
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,270
lost yes so this is the tool

400
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,190
to reach the labels I

401
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,820
simply say label with the field not

402
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,300
with and  so I find the names of the municipality

403
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,580
at this point if I have to describe more

404
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,429
or less the pathology of the area in which I

405
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:38,880
find myself and also the limit I verify that the

406
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,540
common limit of Venice coincides I can

407
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,940
also already make a small print

408
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,690
how to do a print I have to create  a new

409
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,920
room then within the project

410
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,320
a general map and then I also have a

411
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:01,350
series of models for printing and on the

412
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,570
layo  ut print I

413
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,870
add a series of elements if I do not

414
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,760
put the scale in fact it is not a map

415
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,890
ok it is therefore already from here I can start

416
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,250
adding images other things then it goes

417
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,650
on questions

418
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:36,090
I wanted to know if in addition to a

419
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,679
native client like this it will also be present

420
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:41,529
a web application both as

421
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:43,570
regards the visualization of the layers

422
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,269
with the query of the metadata and

423
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:48,279
maybe even a simpler form

424
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,799
of design

425
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,639
then next top right on creating

426
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:56,470
web maps

427
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,919
not one but a thousand that is there are a lot

428
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,730
of possibilities for the composition  of the

429
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,730
map therefore these operations here very

430
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,230
probably it is better to use a

431
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,539
desktop software that is therefore the operation of

432
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:12,250
choosing the layers there is also

433
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,610
simpler and that is open jam for example

434
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,409
always open source

435
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,659
then there is more complicated maybe to

436
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:22,179
do  hydrological analyzes etc. for

437
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:25,480
which qg itself also has

438
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,520
an application a server application

439
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,039
so I within the project for

440
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,610
example on these  things here post on the

441
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,520
properties of the layer I can already

442
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,740
set when I publish it on

443
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,580
a server they can set the metadata

444
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,799
I want to go and see even if

445
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,659
there is a lot of problems on the encoding of the metadata

446
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:49,090
here is the tab on  server

447
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,480
this is the rl that you see at the

448
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,650
vms server level that

449
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,260
the protocol we say is fundamental

450
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,400
for maps and for example yesterday maybe for between

451
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,770
I was talking about the cadastre when I connect to

452
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,160
a server I get the list of layers of the

453
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,000
available layers and then I can  upload

454
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
1 but I always get sick a map

455
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,500
so today it can be installed

456
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,960
on a server it runs as fastigi ai and

457
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,550
then once I have set up

458
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,740
this project here I do nothing but

459
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,830
upload to the server and

460
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,480
the layers are displayed as well as  I

461
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,910
put them here very simple passion so it

462
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,850
is complete let's say yes or in any case

463
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,490
in the open source gis ecosystem you

464
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,190
can really do everything that is the

465
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,920
management of all data geogr  afico new

466
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,840
infrastructure is made entirely with

467
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,190
open source tools

468
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,290
there is to cry because unfortunately

469
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,910
nothing comes back to the community of that contract in the Veneto region

470
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,280


471
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,130
but there is a problem of tenders and other

472
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,800
things however it is very complete,

473
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,470
maybe you need a moment  focus

474
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,980
however here on facebook they asked me

475
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,800
a journalist says I wanted to do I wanted to

476
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,250
publish blue counts an area a

477
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,190
some data on landslides taking the data

478
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,810
of the visa and then to make a simple

479
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,980
map and publish it

480
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,290
online you can do it easily with qg if

481
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,549
then yes  it generates an html page of

482
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:27,240
this type

483
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,610
and here I already anticipate the topic of the

484
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,070
next one so with a

485
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,140
queryable layer these are the attributes

486
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,610
these are the styles that I chose

487
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,900
before no and this however is always a

488
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,820
wireless service that is the part

489
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,710
of the area  it brakes the vineyard but this is

490
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,049
a high danger area according to the

491
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,200
hydrogeological plan, in short,

492
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,000
so it is certainly possible that the thing is

493
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,140
completely

494
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,200
if the possibility of having

495
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,020
web clients that also integrate

496
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,390
measurement drawing tools, however, there is a risk of

497
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,799
making

498
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,720
incredibly heavy web applications that

499
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,400
replicate and I try not to

500
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,280
do it a little because you risk replicating

501
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,360
all the functionalities  of a

502
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,630
desktop jeans but since I still try to

503
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,030
promote open source gis I say if

504
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,940
one actually needs to draw

505
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,240
the areas of his urban plan it is not

506
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,370
the case that he does it on a web client

507
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,610
in short, it is faster simpler more

508
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,630
versatile to do it  anyway with a

509
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:42,960
desktop client other thanks I wanted to clarify

510
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,840
that on this with the good fortune of working

511
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,850
in the architectural studio and on this

512
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,440
software it is really the de

513
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,990
facto standard and I arrived later than

514
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,840
my other collaborators there I am

515
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,770
programmers and they are all

516
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,809
architects  and everyone there knew how to use

517
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:00,059
this software at a professional level

518
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,250
and they use it for everything for

519
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,630
stirring and cycling  able to manage these

520
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,309
things of the municipality, the land registry,

521
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:08,220
etc. and as a client it is the

522
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,530
most efficient solution to contribute on

523
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,309
even

524
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,480
large data

525
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,950
while on the web

526
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,620
this thing would be very inefficient, that is, it

527
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,460
would practically be possible to do a series b

528
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,910
there are various web editors hand to a  moment

529
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,990
configured a lot however as a client is

530
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,120
even if it has a server but as a

531
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,400
client the local desktop interface

532
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,450
much more than a hundred compared

533
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,480
to the web interface that instead can not

534
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,669
do it javascript does not have the need for

535
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:42,730
a native application

536
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,990
yes obviously yes

537
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:50,919
obviously  yes, that is, it camps with donations

538
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:55,900
so it would always be desirable that

539
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,090
the various people who

540
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,940
know how to use it and who use it for

541
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,990
professional activity maybe every now and then

542
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,990
they could

543
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,440
also contribute to this element there is

544
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,750
however it is the page now perhaps on

545
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:18,840
the Italian page  I practically lose it,

546
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,530
however, there is a page where we

547
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,190


548
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:29,100
have it published in any case t

549
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,610
All donations now frankly I

550
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:38,729
lost it doctor territories where the event

551
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:44,049
ok for example in the program we find

552
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:48,179
both from mup the list of developers

553
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:52,269
practically and you see that in europe and in

554
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:54,820
italy as we said before we are

555
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,799
and then we have a link to the list

556
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:03,879
In short, donations for which they

557
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:05,860
still hold me this year in reality I

558
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,100
still have to pay a donation but there is

559
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,830
what the value that one gives to the

560
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,110
program 5 10 euros is right that

561
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,549
they also arrive to actually understand

562
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:18,580
how much is used is

563
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,259
de facto standard because

564
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:22,299
a data is published in kindergartens chef file

565
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:24,549
when someone asks yes but as I

566
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:28,720
open it bay downloaded cookies then on the

567
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,200
possibility in short I also saw

568
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,110
my order had launched a

569
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,000
kuji scono course a person certainly

570
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,669
very good at iuav researcher  but that

571
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:42,389
starts by saying qg you are a great

572
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:46,709
free software well if the motivation is that

573
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:50,019
is a bit lame that is I assume that

574
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:51,820
we all know that the lib software  ero is

575
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,879
something more than a free software

576
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:57,219
also because then you really meet people on the street

577
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:59,889
who say ah yes qg it

578
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:02,109
is made by volunteers who have a lot of

579
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:03,209
free time

580
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:06,519
no that maybe it's the kennel of the enpa

581
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,599
but that is a professional activity and I

582
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,489
am  professionals who have

583
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:14,109
started developing it here for their own

584
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,678
professional activity
