00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:04,350
hello everyone incredibly love you know

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,250
I am a bull that a follow up of this

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,250
then in the

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,150
meantime I introduce myself I am federico

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,870
club as you think I work I am the

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,699
developer I am the founder of the

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,270
teacher club here in mestre if you

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,269
had not understood I am a  blockade for

10
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,538
privacy

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,920
I also really like free software

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,420
we have a podcast on a radio in

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,130
Padua that deals with

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,559
privacy control technology and anything else I love the

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,170
web and I hate the web

16
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,370
when there is a slide that shouldn't have been

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,739
there don't pay attention  then as

18
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,110
we are taken at the moment in the

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,750
social sphere we are so taken that is there are

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,850
three billion platforms there are

21
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,520
intersections between users who use

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,500
a certain platform and users

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,610
who use certain other platforms

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,730
the situation is quite confusing

25
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,350
because if you don't find me on  facebook

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,879
find me on twitter find me on sim marmi

27
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,800
find me on telegrams find me on whatsapp

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,559
find me a bit where wow do you think

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,390
the problem is that there are

30
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,460
platforms also quite large and

31
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,320
that have had problems

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,900
these are things we have that we have

33
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,640
seen all the problems that there have been

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,960
with a change of analytics what I

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,220
said before the gentleman does not seem

36
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,200
convinced and indeed there have been

37
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,759
the centralization of the platforms the

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,140
availability  of data that these

39
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,450
platforms had led to the possibility

40
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,560
of making aggregates of the data

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,729
in these platforms and selling

42
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,329
advertising to those who had a

43
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,369
political interest in passing certain

44
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,549
messages this scandal led to a

45
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,710
minimum of reaction apparently not

46
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,840
strong enough because

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,950
those  who have actually

48
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,049
deleted facebook are very few

49
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,420
already had the idea of doing it and it

50
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,539
was just a twitter storm of a few

51
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:58,049
days

52
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,920
if you see there on March 31 there was already ten

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,950
there is that something of April but in short it

54
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,500
will have already changed but not  I'm here to

55
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,019
say [ __ ] to say [ __ ] exclusively

56
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:11,250
on facebook I already do this

57
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,739
enough  a during the rest of my life

58
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:17,780
especially it's not just facebook i'm

59
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,610
afghano as wow they are called during the

60
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,190
day they are these funny guys who are

61
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,260
the main apple already less than the others

62
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,599
but these are the main the

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,220
main platforms is that they manage

64
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:36,170
given communications as it was gafà thanks

65
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,720
so what can we poor

66
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,549
christs who want to share our

67
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,440
data but we necessarily want to

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,790
put them in the hands of these platforms

69
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,500
welcome to the indie web what is the web

70
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,209
in reality is more than anything else a community

71
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:52,920
and a series of principles these are the

72
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,500
principles  have ownership of your

73
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,400
data use and publish visible data

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,920
then let's see what it means to scratch

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,510
your itches in the sense if you have a

76
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:03,930
problem

77
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,870
solve veil and help others use

78
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,000
what you do document what you

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,420
do

80
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,579
tend to prefer to use

81
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:12,930
free software rather than

82
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,099
proprietary software  this point here is

83
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,510
quite interesting because

84
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,760
experience comes first  the user then comes the

85
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,579
protocols so first we decide

86
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,889
how something is to be used as

87
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:27,900
a particular feature

88
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,549
we predict which features

89
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,760
are to be used after which we

90
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,840
will give the technician to build protocols

91
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,280
that are independent from the platforms

92
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,690
and therefore I do not have to build the

93
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,190
protocol for facebook I have to  build

94
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,970
the protocol that speaks to the web

95
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,209
also this then we see how longevity

96
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,220
therefore the data I publish must be

97
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,450
online as much as possible to avoid

98
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,360
that the links to that data no longer have a

99
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,080
meaning plurality so the more there is the

100
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,370
better

101
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,819
and above all have fun obviously  we

102
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:04,930
should also ask ourselves why we want to

103
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,090
do this a bit for control,

104
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,040
that is to have agency checks on

105
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,080
our data and on what is about us

106
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,560
online to have the centrality

107
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,930
on the author and not on the platform on

108
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,680
facebook

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,320
nobody matters a [ __ ] let's face it and

110
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,250
it must all be very robust as

111
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,130
these are the foundation steps points

112
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,590
buy them a domain get me a

113
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,190
sweeper sting make a very

114
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,970
simple site obviously there will be something

115
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,669
more no then first let

116
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:42,430
's try to figure out how to create a profile

117
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,350
so to speak how to have our identity

118
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,600
don't be scared it's not as messed up

119
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,860
as it seems

120
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,260
this period of  my site and what

121
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,920
you need is an object a class of

122
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,460
card that explains how it shows us that from

123
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,960
here on it is my business card

124
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,840
up to here and it is simply a

125
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,520
presentation where I wrote I am cles

126
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,629
founder of I am

127
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:17,039
founder developer of  mestre a club i like about

128
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,750
software i like privacy i like the

129
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,280
network of this i told him that federico

130
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,129
cles colocates a name through this

131
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,349
this class so i surround my

132
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:32,569
name with a spam that to this class

133
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,400
which in turn contains my name

134
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,759
my nick and my surname

135
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,220
then there is another nested vcard

136
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,229
that contains mistress club as an

137
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,360
organization and mortara and then there is the

138
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,870
photo this  how it comes out once

139
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,729
rendered exactly as veil you

140
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,759
would expect then simply the

141
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,949
text we have seen with the two links

142
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:00,870
1 my name is a club teacher the link

143
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,469
to my name points the site often yes what

144
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:07,259
's the great thing about all this is that

145
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:08,310
a  machine

146
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,050
the program can read this

147
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,590
information and extract my photo

148
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,129
my name

149
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:17,580
2 rl which is linked to my name

150
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,880
and oh well levi cardani dates are still a

151
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,590
bit of a work in progress

152
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:28,139
but in short, it can be done

153
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,270
is telling me that the email is missing  but

154
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,129
now I do not take it because it

155
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:36,119
spam and how this page did it

156
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:37,709
can be done by any other

157
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:42,869
program so what do I know I publish a post on

158
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:47,969
a blog and I say the author is dude caio who is

159
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:50,759
not me maybe because  he collaborated

160
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,369
on my site celino an application

161
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:55,139
can go if my own site can

162
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,639
fetch this person's vcard

163
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,429
from his site and publish the information

164
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:02,789
on my site had made a bit of

165
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,080
confusion I hope you understand this  to

166
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,319
i want to say another interesting thing

167
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,099
that can be done and the authentication

168
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:16,199
is there is a protocol that web sign in or

169
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,759
in of auto as you like and two ways to

170
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,740
do it 1 and local out providers that i

171
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,209
should put myself on a server  on my

172
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:24,749
car

173
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:27,959
honestly I haven't done it yet where

174
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,959
I am authenticating that I authenticate myself

175
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,489
to other sites in a simpler way in

176
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:36,809
reality it is to use rally links that

177
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:38,969
indicate that the link in question

178
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:41,240
here for example my twitter profile

179
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,229
points to a point  profile that talks about

180
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:47,849
me that is on my site I am saying this

181
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:51,089
this link talks about me in particular

182
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:53,219
added twitter and kitab this as it

183
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,189
comes out once rendered

184
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:58,769
obviously if I go to a site that

185
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,389
supports authentication in the

186
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:03,149
web I give it mine  site and noemi says bon on

187
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,889
your site I found these two

188
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,669
authentication providers these two rallies which one

189
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:10,529
I want to use in this case under di

190
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:13,319
pub because it was more beautiful to see

191
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,860
so

192
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,099
the application in di out asks ad  the tab

193
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:21,789
to login in gi tab or a link

194
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,229
pointing back to my site so it can be

195
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:26,560
verified in two directions that

196
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,330
we are the same person because only I

197
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,129
can add my tab site is

198
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:31,539
only I can add my

199
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:35,589
life profile to the  my site and once you

200
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:39,450
authorize the audi loghino sorry to

201
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,299
read the data from my profile data

202
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:47,410
from kitab I logged in the wiki of the

203
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,380
web as you can see I simply

204
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,790
click on

205
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,050
login I tell him link of my site I authorize

206
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,130
in log  to authenticate I am authenticated

207
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,500
on the wiki of god in the web

208
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,240
another thing we can do is have

209
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,829
possession of our data these

210
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:09,940
trivial and a blog

211
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,570
there are posts each post is composed of

212
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,480
a permalink so a link that

213
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,790
will never ever change

214
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,940
hopefully  permanent link to my article

215
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,010
is an object and centers that is a little bit

216
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,350
more complex in the sense that I have my

217
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,600
article that as we said with in

218
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,209
centers that has various things like it has a

219
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:40,480
title at 1 rl standard a date d  i

220
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,600
publication

221
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,339
sorry a title in this case a

222
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:47,110
publication date

223
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,360
and then there is the actual content of the

224
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,430
article also this can be

225
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,730
passed obviously this the result

226
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,290
rendered in normal html screenshot

227
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,510
from the blog and it is machine with hubble

228
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,740
just as we said then  he is

229
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,140
telling me that this is the title

230
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,100
the author says that the photo is missing but

231
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,870
honestly having my big face on

232
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,980
each post seemed a bit vain he

233
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,019
says that it is me that is my

234
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:18,250
link here is the beginning of the  article and

235
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,920
then it tells me that there is the date there is the

236
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,480
permanent link and it is asking me to

237
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,000
add some copies in syndication

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,790
then let's see what they are and the category of the

239
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,260
blog what we can use for

240
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,910
what are the posts can be

241
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,500
anything  they can be articles

242
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,140
then blog photos so we could

243
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,079
replace instagram picasa picasa lists

244
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,360
still bob microsoft that twitter review

245
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,569
and then reviews on amazon reviews

246
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,660
by rizzi reviews on woods

247
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,040
qualsi  asi what you want to review instead of

248
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
doing the review on the site you do it

249
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,600
on your blog and marked it as such

250
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,060
comments arranged and then let's see how the

251
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,860
e post so if I liked an

252
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,240
article and I want to publish it on

253
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,779
my blog

254
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:12,420
I can do it video events replies  at

255
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,470
20 most of the things we

256
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,390
can basically do with facebook instead

257
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,610
of using facebook we can do it with

258
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,260
our site that communicates with other

259
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,120
sites that obviously have to endure

260
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,440
all this is precisely how you can do

261
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,110
to make all this social

262
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,550
the simplest thing is

263
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,269
it was therefore to publish on your site

264
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,980
and mayor is indicated to index elsewhere

265
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,959
what it means public all the

266
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,850
compound up on my blog

267
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,790
I take the link in the neck on twitter to the

268
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,160
boys I published a new

269
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,200
link so you do not lose the visibility that it

270
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,769
is on the social network  and in any case the

271
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:58,079
content is in my hand, I control it, of

272
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,899
course, all this can be

273
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,339
automated, it is not that it has done so

274
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:02,990
manually

275
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,019
what is the of wei are the web mansion is

276
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,910
a protocol that uses only

277
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:14,070
http so no need for

278
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,800
special protocols functions in four steps

279
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,570
the first thing is to mention a link

280
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,959
then I author mention a

281
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,380
link my blog will search for the endpoint web

282
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,040
mansion of the  blog i'm mentioning will

283
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,920
notify the blog i'm mentioning

284
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,720
who is mentioned verify that i'm

285
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,700
actually mentioning it and

286
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,500
that's it

287
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,089
in detail the first thing to do is

288
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:41,640
to mention a link to which i

289
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,940
will simply put a link on my

290
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,440
post i will put a link to a  another blog of

291
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,040
or this article is very

292
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,020
cool my blogging software will

293
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,880
look on the

294
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,620
blog pro link on the article that I

295
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,720
linked so precisely to puzzle

296
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,790
precisely and jean paul what

297
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,590
was it was a pick up tip of the mold the post

298
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,590
by aaron will go to  look for

299
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,850


300
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,860
one of these things on that page or a link in the

301
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,380
leder of the page that tells me which is

302
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,350
the web point of the web mansion and

303
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,930
recognizes it  I would go from this rally or

304
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,150
directly a link within the

305
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:29,260
page that mentions the web mansion

306
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,800
or even higher right in the

307
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,390
http header will expect this response

308
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,380
with rail web mansion which indicates to me that

309
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,640
where led point

310
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,020
at this point once  I know

311
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,030
which end point I can send an area a

312
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,190
mail to this in point indicating two

313
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,190
things or my site the page that

314
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,530
is working

315
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,930


316
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,160


317
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,530


318
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,930
mentioning at this point the server will

319
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,420
reply that it has accepted the request

320
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,160
the server should grant it this non-

321
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,800
standard 3 c for the record anyway

322
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,780
so there are all what

323
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,730
should do what the communicator with

324
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,390
this protocol must do at this point

325
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,640
he puts it in  queue and he told me I

326
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,280
accepted the web mansion now let's

327
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,820
check so aaron aaron's blog

328
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,560
will do a simple get on the page

329
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,620
that I indicated as sourc  and he

330
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,300
will verify that there is a link to target

331
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,130
to avoid spreading random links is

332
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,960
here he will decide what to do with this

333
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,270
web mansion could be used

334
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,590
as it once did with

335
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,050
pingback that at the end of the article

336
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,760
this article was mentioned by

337
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,090
or it can be used  as this

338
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:00,010
article is a response to there are various

339
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,520
implementations of everything i'm ambaradan

340
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,610
wordpress obviously can you can

341
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,050
install plugins to support

342
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:08,950
webs

343
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,440
not that it was developed on purpose to

344
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,230
be a blog that supports these

345
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,960
protocols drupal

346
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,540
yes also drupal jekyll which is a

347
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,220
generator  of blog status of

348
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,680
static blogs written in ruby so you

349
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,300
just give him the text of your

350
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,310
post and he generates a blog

351
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,950
around that pelican text that what

352
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,780
I use which is the same thing but

353
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,820
written in python and many many  many

354
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,530
many many others there is an endless list

355
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,400
on suicides

356
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,760
i dindi web in case you are not what

357
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,060
you need

358
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,710
remember among the main  i the number 3

359
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,960
scratch in your pruiti if it does not exist create it

360
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,560
which is never a bad idea

361
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,150
here I give you some links to inform you

362
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,940
better in the web precisely the

363
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,310
main site a wiki so if you have ideas

364
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,200
you can add them all the discussion

365
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,170
is done or  directly on the wiki or

366
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:14,890
on the rc in the indie web channel on free not

367
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,250
in the web hi fi what is the site I

368
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,930
was showing you before that read

369
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,990
from my site and pulled out the small

370
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,820
information and allows you in a

371
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,480
more or less interactive way to check

372
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,200
that your site meets the web standards

373
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,070
so to speak

374
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,060
this is the link to the web

375
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,370
mansion protocol directly from the

376
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,710
feed c site apparently the router is

377
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,830
still useful for something and micro format

378
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,900
cue jorge describes all those various

379
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,839
vcards and centers all those all

380
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:52,160
those notes that I added on

381
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,310
the ml chain for

382
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,379
[Music

383
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:00,800
] just to see technically how they

384
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,600
should be done

385
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,230
oh well it was fun I didn't hear

386
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,390
any live but it was d  ivertente

387
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,349
if you call us questions we still

388
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:14,589
have less than two minutes and 40 seconds

389
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:21,849
so I really liked the

390
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,529
intervention when, however, you publish

391
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:27,669
something on your site

392
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:30,200
someone else sees it in the sense yes

393
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,929
someone exists a facebook that decides

394
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:35,600
to download that  who wants

395
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,149
anyway if he keeps them he takes the data but

396
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:42,169
if I want to sing them yes I do

397
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:45,049
not solve this I am not solving

398
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:47,450
this I am solving the fact that

399
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,490
they delete the delete from the

400
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,950
publication in the sense that if

401
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,630
one day something that I wrote but it is

402
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,809
okay  they delete it sex my site

403
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,549
they need at least a magistrate to

404
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:00,590
delete it and it is certainly not facebook

405
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,860
that is mobilized to delete it I do not

406
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,419
solve that problem that another

407
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:09,500
problem I still do not know I have no idea

408
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,809
how to solve it let's think about it let's try

409
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:14,570
it willingly it's a problem

410
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,700
I don't know minimizing  it's a problem and it

411
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,950
was funny thanks but a

412
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,890
negative answer for him ie in the youtube world

413
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,309


414
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,260
you want to talk  to the public you agree that

415
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,399
anyone can make a copy

416
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:28,399
if you protect yourself from

417
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,409
automatic acquisition there are robots and then

418
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,940
decide in this way your policies

419
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,980
but with india and that sap and io cruz

420
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,200
confirms mass is usually true is that you

421
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,480
publish or  for everyone or for a

422
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,429
small group and therefore knowledge

423
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:42,710
the link the web mansion of yours with their

424
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,049
content and will be visible only to those who have

425
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:47,840
had this notification of this link and

426
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,179
may have elements of a secret for

427
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:52,330
which they are in their have  access

428
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,620
or you can make even more

429
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,750
robust applications on if if you leave this group

430
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,789
then you can see this content but

431
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,260
this only works if they hear on the

432
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,220
server or

433
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,460
yes that is, you can create

434
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,280
clashes for which I know

435
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,659
just who at this

436
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:13,200
precise link that tom  went by e-mail

437
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,179
so I want to hope that if

438
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,549
only you have it with account that in the end for

439
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:19,559
example only you will read it or I can

440
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,059
say if you want to read this page if

441
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,400
the  authentication with the web even

442
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,490
if you want, then you can do latent

443
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,049
cation as we saw at the beginning

444
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:31,080
but yes, for good or bad there are now that

445
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,250
you make me think if there are

446
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,230
mechanisms to limit the

447
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,270
readability of a post but

448
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,590
actually if you publish it

449
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,418
published and is anyone

450
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:47,370
I fear that the problem of making sure that

451
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,280
no one can see something that

452
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,350
I once published is more or less

453
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,750
unsolvable from the moment we

454
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,289
lost the materiality of the data

455
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:02,200
once support if it had not been

456
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,990
and clicked could  destroy

457
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,840
support to destroy a knowledge

458
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,390
today if someone was able to

459
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,890
see it listen to it out digitize it

460
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,860
and to no avail protections

461
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:24,200
that make it not as they say

462
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,400
viewable do not make stable

463
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,070
again the theme that is not there and

464
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,120
has no solution in fact no

465
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,559
the  funny thing that however this thing

466
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,640
works in two senses in the sense that those who

467
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,140
want to make their information disappear

468
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,100
from the internet p  For legitimate reasons,

469
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,650
he can do it but if someone

470
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,169
has made a copy in the meantime,

471
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:50,549
on the other hand, it also applies to those who want

472
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,049
to make inconvenient but legitimate information disappear

473
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:56,309
and therefore all attempts to

474
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:58,559
delete information that is

475
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,340
legitimate that it is public go  to that

476
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,760
country

477
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,600
therefore it is a double-edged sword if and

478
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,690
how this set of protocols macro

479
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,040
format web mansion etc.

480
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,740
interfaces with activity pub that

481
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,700
another protocol does not integrate in the

482
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,720
sense that it is not self-purpose so to speak it does

483
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,010
not detract from the fact that you  you

484
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,320
can make the posts when they are

485
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,440
published to send a notification that

486
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,780
you are signed up for another activity ipab you can

487
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,970
do an onwards activity I pardo here only

488
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,090
that not auto scott we said for

489
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,970
what concerns it has nothing to do with web

490
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,440
mansions that was the question  it is

491
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,800
another thing

492
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,420
to make subscriptions to the rss you can

493
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,210
be a system I can connect a

494
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,060
blog and active that it does quietly and

495
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,440
then that I know the public or even  and he

496
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,760
just posts billing on

497
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,190
mastodon at which point the activity pub for

498
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,460
free

499
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:15,690
I don't know if he answered another demo werewolf

500
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,700
let's go eat

501
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,259
[Applause]
