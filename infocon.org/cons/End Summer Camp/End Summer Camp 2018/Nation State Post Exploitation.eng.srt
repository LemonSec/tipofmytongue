1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,449
so good morning to all the guys

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:06,830
alessandro today we will talk for a moment about

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,849
post exploitation what is post

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,020
exploitation let's start for a moment from the

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,180
pippone who has always done this stuff

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,150
here when I encourage I had snot

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,480
on my nose and people did penetration

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,910
test there was a  substantial difference

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,668
between via ept ago regulations assessment

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,059
was to find all the vulnerabilities on a

11
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,120
target taking out the analyst from the

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,320
systems engineer and to have a pit fixed

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,760
was to break through those systems go down

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,370
to nathan del bianconiglio and bring

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,239
out everything that was possible to

16
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,000
do today

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,190
today our dear

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,760
salespeople have transformed the going

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,250
down to the rabbit hole into

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,580
something else called red teaming

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,930
or adversary simulation it is the pitti

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,020
usually stops in tos founded the single

23
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,990
machine you do not set the company in toto

24
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,939
up  to get to the box of the

25
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,650
delegate minister to say this whole

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,290
part here of what I do after

27
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,720
I have broken through a system  but then it enters

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,960
the system I do privilege escalation

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,060
gain privileges t systems of root and

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,350
I do other things this is called

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,240
posters playstation everything that

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,780
is done after the written shaun which is

33
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,540
only the beginning because to become all

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,649
assist on a machine and then

35
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,600
acquire of  the maximum privileges of

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,409
the machine is just the beginning

37
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,820
there is a whole activity that is done

38
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,530
after which is to spread one's

39
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,719
penetration within the network which

40
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,700
is done in different ways with

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,130
different perspectives and different

42
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,109
points of view that is to  example how I

43
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:06,000
move within the company

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,840
which are the targets it must break through

45
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,489
rather than others how I

46
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,260
manage all these targets and

47
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,510
compared to others it is in my opinion the

48
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,920
most important part of the pt because it is the

49
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,430
one that really leads you to

50
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,989
interesting thing that is maybe you want to

51
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:24,450
break a dmz host but the really

52
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,260
important meat is assuming for example is

53
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,410
obviously who pays you not ca

54
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,730
usually pisce the report that is given

55
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,730
nowadays the one where there is a

56
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,340
screenshot of an xss sky written of

57
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,700
one cm of him he wants to see the

58
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,650
real real risk effect that there is on his

59
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,940
company example if you go there

60
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,859
it would report the presentation where you

61
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:49,379
show him the emails he exchanges

62
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,299
with his mistress that the secretary

63
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:52,530
really understands the impact of a

64
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,239
security mode rather than

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,650
having written about how to

66
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,540
do it with the usual things you all

67
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,959
know  example m explodes métier on the

68
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,930
ground or even commercial tools

69
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,349
such as canvas core impact

70
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:12,840
that also cost a bang of money

71
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,980
meter for three that you all know does

72
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,620
with a very simple thing load a

73
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,209
stage in memory fouls injection and dll

74
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,170
establishes a  channel encrypts all ls

75
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,780
with your console and you can

76
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,270
load extensions to do a bit of everything there is

77
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,780
also small extensions for

78
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,610
darkened mail shaun for example the

79
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,380
one for for  the challenger for the

80
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,890
token dante make it use a little everyone

81
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,150
at least those of you who make pt and are very dear and

82
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,330
dear very cute in short, nice what is the

83
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,650
real problem of this thing here

84
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,200
this is a public tool that everyone

85
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,989
uses on a broad spectrum and with the  the general

86
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:02,630
public, however, where is your god in an

87
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,620
interprise imac where the

88
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,269
security technologies that they could not have at home

89
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,170
are those various types of

90
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,019
security tools that monitor what you

91
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,149
do at various levels from the network

92
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:20,298
island point level and just reloaded a

93
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,479
known stuff the network I know that

94
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,040
this company lights up like

95
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,870
Christmas so what is the message as you

96
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,760
know very well IT security

97
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,740
is an arms

98
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,620
race and the arms race brings us to improve the

99
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,770
attacker's weapons improve the

100
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,460
technologies of  detention of the defenders if you

101
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,900
do not tell me that the guy I end up here

102
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,950
I go

103
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,430
you know true

104
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:04,849
no I attack the charger test and what the

105
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:08,889
hell think about it

106
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,120
is that football that is  it is if I did not leave I

107
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,900
swear I was leaving

108
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,120
in fact like tony stark

109
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,210
there are people who do not do commercial pts there are

110
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,740
people who pee for

111
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,670
strategic interests and those who make picts for

112
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,170
strategic interests to different resources and

113
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,410
different ress methodologies and  also

114
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,480
different objectives from the normal people

115
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,340
who work in the seacure.it area and

116
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,630
normal probably also have tools

117
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,160
as he suggests not about general mike

118
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,920
rodgers different what do we know about

119
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,710
this thing here obviously little

120
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,480
until one fine day last year

121
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,770
when we are still there  he enjoyed the

122
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,670
internet because there was a lot of

123
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,410
lux shadow brokers posted a

124
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,880
beautiful link called lost in

125
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,910
translation where you can find the link

126
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,410
there was a lot of stuff

127
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,190
swift documents various things is a lot of tools a

128
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,640
[ __ ]  of really really nice stuff

129
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,200
two of these dundas ef bank now

130
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,820
we will talk about them a bit because they are their

131
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,610
frameworks to break through the machines in

132
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,330
essence what is this stuff

133
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,970
the faz bance is the analogue of  i meta floyd

134
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,430
practically a command line stuff

135
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,800
to launch split dante spritz in

136
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,140
my opinion instead it is the nicest tool they have

137
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,820
is a framework of places these shaun

138
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,140
that is what is then under

139
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,160
control after is a gui written in java

140
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,860
n modules really many written  a bit

141
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,190
in python is a bit in a

142
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,400
custom scripting language they have them and it is

143
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,880
designed to do

144
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,140
strategic and tactical penetration operations

145
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,700
so totally different from what

146
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,810
we are used to and if you take a good look at

147
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,970
all the files of the leak you will

148
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,740
find some  with a

149
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,460
fairly old changelog and dates the

150
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,700
oldest of 2001 practically they

151
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,650
had three different versions of the framework

152
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,140
3 different scripts

153
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,960
the oldest of 2001 so it's a

154
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,730
well established stuff who remembers

155
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,460
that they have age of moore released the

156
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,860
first match  point public which was

157
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,940
written in perl at the time 2004 how much

158
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,070
for understand this in 2001 from

159
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,280
there was this stuff

160
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,600
as you see the language  of

161
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,980
custom scripting for some modules in a lot

162
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:09,110
of xml at the vaud script level and

163
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,110
they basically implemented the

164
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,900
following workshop which kittens

165
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,130
explain to them via faz bank split and

166
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,520
shawn framework they load their suites

167
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,350
which for most of the stuff they

168
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,669
they have and that was in here the news

169
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:27,470
I was there practically from the

170
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,990
publication of this link here I think there

171
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,630
will be more than forty sales

172
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,289
are said to which that of juan akrai

173
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,719
then they export target on the target

174
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,460
load not double pulsar which is a nice

175
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,860
modular  useless that architecture

176
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,510
totally in memory extremely arile

177
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,980
of apple made to work always which

178
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,120
in turn loads the system for example

179
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,430
come there the action as if it were mar ter being

180
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,510
able to do your thing

181
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,490
immediately after the control is passed

182
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,520
to under spritz that  it is

183
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,500
your compromise management framework

184
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,450
from which you do things

185
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,230
interactively in an

186
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,150
all-down way  ssima footprint

187
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,910
on the host all extremely weak i.e. it

188
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,700
is industrial stuff this made tested

189
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,490
with quality levels on rens to

190
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,440
ensure that on that target with that

191
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,150
paging version everything worked as

192
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,340
at the operational level

193
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,470
they had invented a whole series

194
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,750
of things totally different from  what

195
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,540
is better sprite because obviously they

196
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,710
are interested in the security

197
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,500
of the operation that I carry out in the first place

198
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,200
so for example for each single

199
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,580
operation

200
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,440
they had a pair of private public keys

201
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,540
to establish the encryption for

202
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,050
that single operation

203
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,480
they had a management level control of the operation

204
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,060
complete this

205
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,780
we see later they had the concept of

206
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,400
repository a little bit like that of the

207
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,580
metroid loot but much more advanced

208
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,330
in the sense of

209
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,860
the usefulness in the meta spot that takes the stuff

210
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,460
put it in and oh well done a little more

211
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,540
this did an

212
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,180
automatic correlation because it was done for  manage

213
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,820
targets from maybe thousands of hosts you

214
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,500
need to  and having everything automatically

215
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,580
even had a reporting module done

216
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,680
in a le qaeda way and the

217
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,500
constructs you used from the notes you want to

218
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,780
be iwate a tex amri was generated

219
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,720
which in my opinion were analogous to the

220
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,880
military report that wrote

221
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,190
me something every day  of this kind in an

222
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,050
automatic way so the concept of this

223
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,660
stuff is utmost professionalism all

224
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,400
industrialized the operator must not

225
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,730
waste time

226
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,040
let's see how the workflow takes place that

227
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,420
we saw first thing

228
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,820
after the compromise of the host as soon as the

229
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,910
control is passed from under spritz to

230
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,550
part  automatic with

231
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,089
very light discovery

232
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:15,769
with a very minimal footprint

233
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:17,870
to collect basic information from all targets that

234
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,809
commit compromise

235
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,449
such as how it stands in the

236
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,910
extreme operational fact ip addresses

237
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,350
hulan menate drive mounted drivers

238
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,499
used soft and installed services

239
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:35,720
there is an antivirus  or not

240
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,100
very important how you do the

241
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,059
configuration  ion of the operating system

242
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:40,749
so if there is hardening if that is editing

243
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:42,800
if there is any configuration in

244
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,959
particular that could be a

245
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,819
dangerous system at the level

246
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:50,089
of the operator who must move

247
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:53,959
recent files used usb stick and inserted

248
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:57,769
and menate various scripts are these

249
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:02,240
this the python script and code written

250
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,040
well and you can see that he wrote he does it by

251
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,980
profession notice the function and save from

252
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,259
mons because they too are nice and

253
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:11,180
cute and therefore the races writes a lot

254
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,079
of [ __ ] like everyone

255
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:17,180
after the discovery in case the lost is a

256
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,120
our interesting step is to extract

257
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,050
everything possible from this host

258
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,939
obviously with all the

259
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:28,490
known forensic techniques and the use of

260
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,829
tomorrow's pool of forensics all integrated

261
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:35,149
into the tool it was possible to find

262
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,059
certain typical information such as the

263
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:40,519
memory of the processes pass the files

264
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,769
there  of application support to

265
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:44,089
individual applications that are

266
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:45,559
commonly installed in step ici

267
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:52,149
firefox chrome plus bonus points f

268
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:57,309
ragola analysis of the mft is a very nice thing

269
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,499
signaling in the event that

270
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:03,019
drivers or modules were loaded meat

271
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:06,319
to the suspects that is always in their

272
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,259
perspective of remaining invisible there was

273
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:11,899
a module a driver that could

274
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:14,720
seem strange not widespread

275
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,240
an arci attention appeared to him maybe here

276
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,970
there is a monitoring technology

277
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,089
all be careful what you do plus

278
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:24,069
n other things that are a little bit that

279
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,079
common that are done during

280
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,569
forensic analysis oden transferor response

281
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:30,670
that is all files and recent all

282
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,290
things recently used bns that comes out

283
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,449
all technologies  like rdp or all

284
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,279
probably used by that one is going

285
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,100
to jump on other of spain

286
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,050
periodic desktop shopping just a c log

287
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,490
to see what happens keylogging

288
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,939
possibility to do on the let

289
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:55,620
crawling cable of session tokens and passwords

290
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,660
other bonus points strawberries for

291
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,029
full support share  point for

292
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:03,279
which more or less conveniently

293
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,029
automated possibilities to index and download  are data

294
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,480
from the sharepoint collections and support

295
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,910
to the various databases that could be

296
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,439
installed on the machine whose oracle if

297
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:15,490
this was etc.

298
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,610
all that stuff there were plugins

299
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,949
to download initial data as

300
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:22,899
an analyst of b the first ten rows of

301
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,189
each table to understand if  inside there is

302
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:25,779
an interesting stuff or not to the three

303
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:29,740
set roms so he understood what is on the

304
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,209
lost step after I go disable the

305
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:36,809
security measures

306
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,389
there is support for practically all the

307
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:45,930
psp of the era yes antivirus that dr

308
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,480
obviously through  xml that was underneath

309
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,839
they all had girls because

310
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:54,370
going to understand what was running on the

311
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,220
machine above are the scripts as

312
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,370
you can see there are eps scripts stuff custom

313
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,189
action script perl below on xml there is

314
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:05,290
another python various technologies

315
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,220
there is really a lot  stuff in here

316
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,259
disabled an antivirus or the

317
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:13,000
drs pass the persistence measure in which

318
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,120
they had

319
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,790
extremely configurable advanced persistence tools

320
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,610
totally different d  to the various listeners who

321
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,480
can have mit floyd because these

322
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,069
work concept must be invisible

323
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:30,790
so it is not that I open the 444 or a

324
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,070
social rever that a

325
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,700
permanent one connected they have a rover

326
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,910
shell that in case you can listen to the

327
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,990
specification now I only have through port king

328
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,070
of the  asynchronous call back for which the

329
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,810
machine does the nice things that you

330
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,610
have programmed to do after a certain

331
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,290
point at a certain time maybe before it gives

332
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,210
away all results in a block so

333
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,770
as to do as little traffic as possible

334
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,300
obviously ava and its proxy support

335
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,190
they are the nerd tools proxy support

336
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,660
as soon as and as soon as they are launched on an

337
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,220
enterprise network they crash on a tour

338
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,730
file hours are caught immediately

339
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,830
as you see while you configure

340
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,370
this stuff

341
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,770
he interactively I

342
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,680
ask you questions you answer

343
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,410
and then he realizes the persistence on the

344
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,620
target after persistence you have to

345
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,750
move on the network which is that you have

346
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,080
just broken through here again

347
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,760
in the perspective of  The invisibility is not that

348
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,000
you, as you are used to, we enter

349
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,590
the machine started doing in the map

350
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,490
fule from 165 thousand and pass under the

351
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,980
internal network and maybe even pull down

352
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,690
the logging system the rules because they

353
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,110
are not used to seeing here print nard and

354
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,550
they did  very very selective things

355
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,830
had extremely

356
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,300
targeted scanners for what could be

357
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,910
the possible exposure that they

358
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,130
maybe detected through the acquisition of

359
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,349
data that as soon as they made the

360
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,109
internal network so they made less traffic as

361
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,589
possible obviously used the

362
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:13,800
credentials from luther they already had

363
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,500
always numbered in an intelligent way

364
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,000
in the sense that there is the possibility but

365
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,550
it is not a design designed to do

366
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,750
something like the minister of

367
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,609
credentials that numbered at the

368
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:29,070
shoots of the network everything was

369
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,940
done selectively

370
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,650
there was also the possibility of  do

371
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,400
piloting through the administrative scenes

372
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,540
there was a tool on purpose to do this

373
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,670
thing here is all q  his could be

374
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,560
launched by expiring the pockets

375
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,670
for which you want to come in do work after

376
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:48,480
a certain time everything starts in a

377
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,750
planned way everything I have

378
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,070
shown you is under a

379
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,300
beautiful concept called that of spt

380
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,840
handler that is, who knows who

381
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,140
did it  well head in a team maybe that is

382
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,140
the figure Mr. who knows a lot

383
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,450
because he has been writing sprites for twenty years but he

384
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,820
is also there in June I had just arrived

385
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,400
that you put him to do a pit and

386
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,380
maybe he does things he shouldn't do and

387
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,850
maybe  he turns off the target machine

388
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,010
because he made a mistake he thought he was

389
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,810
on his had turned off the client's server

390
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,770


391
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,270
captain has made a tactical operation

392
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,220
with these things must not

393
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,820
happen so they have created this

394
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,400
concept of safety handler to make

395
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,530
sure that  idiots are not

396
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:42,530
that much, that is, there are constructs that can be

397
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,100
selected by the manager

398
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,280
of the operation to give privileges

399
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,320
through euro-type cells to the

400
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,020
operators who work

401
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,670
there  it is that operator can for example

402
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,420
insert a key in the registry can

403
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,970
inject dlls can drop a file

404
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,100
on the file system because I trust him I know

405
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,840
what he has to do others

406
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,520
cannot do it and so they

407
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,150
even secured their operation

408
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,220
by themselves so just to say the

409
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,650
level of sophistication of these tools

410
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:23,700
as an example of served handler you see

411
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:33,240
then python xml script custom here

412
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,049
example to disable kaspersky

413
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:39,840
you have to go and touch the register there

414
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,730
is a specific construct that requires

415
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,049
a particular privilege to go  to

416
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:52,100
touch register not only are there

417
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,509
particular constructs for example and

418
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:58,350
checking the no of the cpi certain for

419
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,210
actions could lead to the

420
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,580
cpi not only it takes a privilege to

421
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,619
do them but the more echoed lecce

422
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,379
strictly monitored as well as

423
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:09,919
the use of memory etc.

424
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,090
so as much stuff

425
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,699
as you can play with all of this

426
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,009
because i guess i did entice

427
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:25,440
there a lot of  other stuff unfortunately in

428
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,480
scarce 20 minutes I can't tell

429
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,509
all this is a leak of n thousand files and

430
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:33,179
a quintal of stuff really seen is

431
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:37,470
tested to try it a guy

432
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,139
put himself with a lot of patience he made

433
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:43,529
a beautiful design and tab that

434
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:46,350
allows you to create a laboratory to

435
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,239
play this stuff

436
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:52,919
then through baker and vagrant he made

437
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,450
an eno script you want in three

438
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,070
net commands run to your system

439
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,799
he connects download the windows iso

440
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,549
is true and windows seven shawn 2008

441
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:04,409
those he downloads does  geretto

442
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:07,109
scripting creates a domain control

443
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:09,480
a vulnerable target machine is a

444
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,299
windows 10 machine on which it was giving

445
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,549
spritz with which you can play

446
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:17,059
so it realizes what is underneath

447
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:22,559
a mini lan target of 11 is a target

448
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,239
is your web  explicit condemnation

449
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:25,859
you can play this is really

450
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:27,200
beautiful

451
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,409
unfortunately there is only one flaw windows

452
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:34,859
7 on the microsoft site there is no longer he

453
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:36,149
has never updated skype because I know  no

454
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:39,720
one year old goes by so you

455
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,519
have to put yourself in for a moment but

456
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,139
in fixing the script it is a

457
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:45,570
really fire stuff to download the islands

458
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,139
of windows 7 by hand and modify it

459
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:49,720
writes it too much it

460
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,050
will be that easy easy play if

461
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,760
you have time because  really nice it

462
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,500
requires 20 gb of ram yes and of memory and

463
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:05,440
12 of ram I think it is a nice little game

464
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,960
to everything beyond the coolness of

465
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,580
this tour because so much the crops and

466
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,230
leaked for which everything is burned is

467
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,330
detected donis techno of the security

468
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,110
that  one may have

469
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,060
they have started to work on

470
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,820
other stuff I don't know but what we have

471
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,490
learned that they work in the practices

472
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,900
due to the availability of resources

473
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,790
they have to the sensitivity of the targets

474
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,440
that have to break through the

475
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,100
tactical and operational modalities that they use totally

476
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,580
different that leave us suggestions

477
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,710
first of all when he does certain things we don't

478
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,330
slow down the car

479
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,650
they did an extremely

480
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:50,710
granular check of the systems praise for it  er

481
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,390
sure that no one I try to be

482
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:58,780
nothing limited and louis room and

483
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,240
direct traffic because obviously if

484
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,370
you want

485
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,460
me to know notes pt a car you have to

486
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,240
take away a dump of a db of 100gb

487
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,830
that spot that is of traffic

488
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,390
maybe made 100 megs a day  towards the

489
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,140
internet 100 gb became the first top

490
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,330
talker in the next day's report and

491
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,500
systems engineers say what is happening

492
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,300
they almost never doped files that is

493
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,500
almost everything that was

494
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,090
technologically possible to spin

495
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,630
memory we can say love to

496
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,950
drop files

497
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,050
it takes a safety handler  with the

498
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,580
manager's permission everything was encrypted

499
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,070
everything possible with specific single keys

500
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,520
they were on the target and as little as

501
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,100
possible because you, through anders,

502
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,260
prepare the operation,

503
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,650
prepare the commands, then play when

504
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,770
you want or even ska durations in short,

505
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,590
they did everything possible to remain

506
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:04,250
invisible  example there is stuff

507
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,620
then on the left there was the possibility

508
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,690
of the stake lot ring of

509
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,010
direct traffic  so practically here this

510
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,370
the former ml descriptive them all the plugins

511
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,230
described with xml bytes per

512
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,530
second raid rothlin of the

513
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,690
outgoing traffic from that plug in

514
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:30,240
then under 6 keep alive because this command does not

515
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,950
see you says exploded gestures

516
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,650
medium tech bis long so if l  '

517
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,200
e sporting goes along blind shovels to

518
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,880
see if it still settles on

519
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:45,350
everything automatically over the last three lines

520
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,760
monitoring of available space memory

521
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,879
ram

522
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,340
so in the end the real world is different

523
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,600
because it works on a

524
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,600
totally different perspective

525
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,130
there is a lot of private stuff  that runs

526
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,170
because for sure writing this code

527
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,220
is a terrible undertaking which is even less has

528
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,570
been done not by

529
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,460
security people but by

530
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,290
professional developers who worked side by

531
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,180
side with security people in fact

532
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,980
if you then look at the code

533
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,930
at the end you will find clean code  a few

534
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,330
moments gama and clean is written by

535
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,860
professionals and not only

536
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,240
the technical activity counts but also

537
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,970
management q  he did a lot of

538
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,730
management that is most of the tool and

539
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,480
serves to manage the operation not to do it

540
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,170
to manage the propagation to manage the

541
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,220
same operators of the operation so

542
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,360
in the end

543
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,600
in my opinion the causes are those that are

544
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,120
tactical operations done in the nations

545
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,460
towards strategic objectives that can

546
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,980
be anything for what we

547
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,510
mean we are totally

548
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:05,060
invisible to the blue team success that the

549
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,020
footprint is minimal after the operation

550
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,600
there were also among the series of plugins to

551
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,150
clean and obviously in a subjective way

552
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,840
that is nothing but clean  it meant

553
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,000
deleting the logs because a

554
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,640
machine entered where the empty eye from something

555
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,380
wrong

556
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,150
they did everything selectively the

557
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,920
log lines generated by them were

558
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,060
deleted only that is only what

559
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,060
for which a little bit another world that

560
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,660
of  usually those who make pt are normally not

561
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,140
used to seeing that this is obviously

562
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,180
not visible but to think

563
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,520
there are those who make pt in the commercial world

564
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,130
think  to be there on the ground the rivoli

565
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,680
fernandez esp lloyd customer background that

566
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,970
much wasted anyway with the pants

567
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,460
down so I'm cooler in the world

568
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,530
that is you cooler the world I use metasport

569
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,980
seen tutorial applied this is a

570
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,230
totally different world

571
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,760
indeed purely its the gold that  who laugh

572
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,740
when they see us that it is that we go to

573
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,840
conferences to talk about the mind and spirit of

574
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,750
these other things and in my opinion it is

575
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,990
important to know it is a moment to

576
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,600
lower your wings and understand that you can

577
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,730
do even more which is probably

578
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,530
what is done of  more in the world

579
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,710
I am not a forum for

580
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,430
nation state type operators but also for private entities

581
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,080
because in the end the companies those

582
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,550
series that do pt in a serious way all

583
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,920
and tools do not publish them they are

584
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,860
considered private it is totally different

585
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,650
and I would have finished before  of the questions

586
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,170
I leave you two links because in reality

587
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,410
this is a second presentation that

588
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,870
I made on the split action posts is the

589
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,210
second part the first part you can find it

590
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,920
pr  imo the inter at the second link instead

591
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,200
you find these you find here

592
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:06,380
you have questions or rather more beautiful it

593
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,080
happened to you to find some pieces of

594
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,420
these that you told us about

595
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,600
someone who maybe had taken a bit of

596
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,570
them had put them into production

597
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,550
in which  sense has put into production

598
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,520
that is that maybe during some

599
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,470
analysis you did you found that

600
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,050
someone has already put a paw inside

601
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,240
using then modifying

602
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,400
this link almost as it held type more

603
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,210
than 40 0 day has generated a whole series

604
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:40,010
of things example  one cry because there were

605
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,730
at least three sprites in here, one for

606
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,330
wine and two other mb flat brutal flat presses

607
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,870
for which it generated a whole

608
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,070
series of things

609
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:58,400
that I know of and immediately after the leak

610
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,020
no such training published

611
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:06,870
we found these ios to say  on

612
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,100
our systems also because, in any case,

613
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,110
remember that the link occurred

614
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,630
last but here

615
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,670
it is not that the tool is updated six

616
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,160
months before but the oldest that  is

617
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,480
why probably in the immediate

618
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,800
future the bears were would have been totally

619
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,960
different probably this one here eh

620
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,480
maybe even an old version in the

621
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,190
sense that at the time of the leak they

622
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,410
shook the [ __ ] version he used

623
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,370
was not this is another with another name

624
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:41,040
that  I know nobody has published

625
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,910
anything the rode of oil ceo I was no

626
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,130
because these 1 work in

627
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,300
extremely silent invisible mode

628
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,720
they take they cancel more than everything

629
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,850
is not that they are there they have a goal

630
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:01,830
a flag in my opinion and they take their

631
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,710
flag they do not stay anymore  of so many systems

632
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,470
maybe a back dorina or a way to

633
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:11,060
enter if they leave it but certainly not

634
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,000
part of this award here and if

635
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,220
you have seen that type tag cloud that

636
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,500
was there before

637
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,370
each of those names there was a project

638
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:26,550
that was included in  this link here and they

639
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,590
were all projects for an

640
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,690
extremely limited operating category

641
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,910
that was not only penn texts but

642
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,070
was even more specific era e split

643
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:39,090
acti  on and post reputation for which

644
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,050


645
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,080
they played so much for so little who knows for the

646
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:49,280
rest ask questions

647
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:55,539
the plant phase that based on

648
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:59,200
blue triad exploited very well together and

649
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,309
b1

650
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:02,200
there were other platforms other

651
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,870
operating systems object of the plant

652
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,440
or microsoft was  the only

653
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,679
platform i.e. framework was

654
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,480
multiplatform in the sports contained

655
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,929
in the ICC there were also explodes for

656
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:21,760
other technologies

657
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,419
maybe not as eternal blues however

658
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:26,620
there is no listen also for the technology

659
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,970
and platform is made in a

660
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:32,130
multiplatform way so  I

661
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,690
think it would be stupid to say that they did not have for

662
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,370
other platforms because they have it with

663
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,809
the commercials that is if you buy

664
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:41,620
core impact or canvas you have splits

665
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:45,159
ranging from old unixes to old

666
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:47,409
solaris also ok solaris

667
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:50,950
if you want to buy any pack of

668
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,299
it explodes that it is sold on the internet

669
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:54,700
there is a bit of everything so I am

670
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,679
really ridiculous to say that there was

671
00:31:56,679 --> 00:31:58,929
no proof to visit operational

672
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:02,350
maybe  not like the one that led

673
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,059
to cry cai

674
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,410
thanks

675
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:17,079
