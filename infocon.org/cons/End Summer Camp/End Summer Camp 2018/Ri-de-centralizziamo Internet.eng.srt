1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:07,080
hello definitely the the question of the

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,050
centralization of services and therefore

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,019
of users and therefore of

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,580
people's data on the internet does not need

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,929
particular presentations this and

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,300
this context more or less I imagine that

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,810
everyone is

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,480
well aware of what are the

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,050
risks implications conditions of this

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,500
of this  scenario in which many if not

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,670
almost all tend to focus on

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,370
the use of certain services

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,210
offered by a very limited set

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,449
of monopoly suppliers let's face it on the

15
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:47,970
internet and in the end they are those

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,570
we know well google facebook amazon apple

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,960
and microsoft girardi gafà il  circle is

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,309
slightly more extensive than this

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,580
the theme we open hacker communities has already

20
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,950
known for some time nor as we have been talking for some

21
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,100
time for years by virtue of the various

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,500
news events of the last few years

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,380
are more and more recently

24
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,270
analytics and so

25
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,880
on the theme stands out  has become public knowledge

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,890
there are more and more people also not

27
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,450
necessarily adde  to work who

28
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,159
are more or less conscious and more or less

29
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,869
aware of what the fact

30
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:37,110
of having their own data implies and therefore

31
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,940
the information to a limited number

32
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,020
of

33
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,490
economic ponies in fact of company poles is

34
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,240
a risk

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,930
more recently still this this

36
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,970
theme has also gone beyond

37
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,390
the more political and social implications

38
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,400
therefore those related to

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,470
privacy and more recently

40
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,290
the punishment against

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,810
which this centralization

42
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,479
of user data is also a risk of

43
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,949
an economic nature has also extended because

44
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,220
obviously when the users and therefore

45
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,770
the data and therefore the profits have

46
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,490
to do with a few few companies a few

47
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,030
players

48
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,430
obviously go to drain what

49
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,900
are also the

50
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,880
entrepreneurial economic opportunities by

51
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,530
all the others so

52
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,200
more recently c  'it is also beyond

53
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,100
the question of privacy, security, protection of

54
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,209
freedom and whatever else is the danger

55
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:41,709
to the threat of the central  alization of the

56
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,510
internet is extending and more and more

57
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,540


58
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,380
understood and and therefore fought by other

59
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,070
characters other subjects

60
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:59,360
the problem is that very often by

61
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,880
virtue of this new

62
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,350
line of thought that has extended,

63
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,140
the centralization of data on the

64
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,190
internet is first of all

65
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,890
technological character and therefore how do

66
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,570
we solve it we need the new

67
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,490
platform of the new library of the

68
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,460
new protocol of the new framework and

69
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,580
we are always here therefore then we

70
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,970
can talk about block chain federation and

71
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,010
we are more or less there to go

72
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:28,550
around it

73
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,900
we need some  solution

74
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,390
exists the danger exists the problem

75
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,030
we have to face it and then we turn

76
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,680
around where we need to

77
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,380
implement this or that 12

78
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,210
different solutions not compatible with each

79
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:41,840
other

80
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,670
now develops but the thirteenth etc.

81
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,900
etc. etc. etc.

82
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,880
without ever akin to combine an emeritus

83
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,030
[ __ ]

84
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,730
the problem from  my personal point

85
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,260
of view is not alone  technological yes

86
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,820
it can still exist technological but

87
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,290
it is certainly not only a

88
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,570
technological first very often a problem of

89
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,079
a cultural nature

90
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,000
I repeat within our world

91
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,030
we speak it is well known that problem is well

92
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,050
known is well known the issue is very clear

93
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,690
the fact that  to center information and

94
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,350
data in a limited and limited set

95
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,040
of subjects is not good and despite

96
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,560
this I every day find

97
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,510
the link to the document shared on word

98
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,780
doc

99
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,950
the survey done on the

100
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,600
forum registration for the event on

101
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,640
eventbrite etc. etc.  by

102
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,760
the office of the fab lab

103
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,100
mega space group activist members more or less

104
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,590
explicit extending the

105
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,990
digital freedoms of free software and so on,

106
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,970
maybe that's beyond all that

107
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,760
may be the future scenario on

108
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,240
decentralization in which we will all

109
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,550
finally be  free to distribute

110
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,930
our information our data on the

111
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,020
internet without being threatened by

112
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,860


113
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,449
political exploitation e  commercialization of this

114
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:17,060
information maybe and if we could

115
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,750
also make an effort first to

116
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,460
be able to use the already

117
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,990
existing tools to deal with a

118
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,460
certain kind of needs sharing a

119
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,840
file a document is not a science if

120
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,270
maybe we ourselves somehow managed

121
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,690
to use these  tools and to

122
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,820
do is use a little bit of

123
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,360
information we would be able to drain and

124
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,180
remove it gnaw the way from the various

125
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,270
google facebook companion sing it in

126
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,490
this sense it is impossible not to mention

127
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,040
the experience between but soft that

128
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,540
a French association that for several

129
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,050
years has been promoting for the  precisely especially

130
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,610
in france this kind of

131
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,220
attitude and therefore the exposes a

132
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,510
series of services

133
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,420
obviously free or sell on public internet

134
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,350


135
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,750
by virtue of the fact that france there is

136
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,939
also a different sensitivity this kind of

137
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:24,389
themes over the years have

138
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,310
also achieved a certain visibility and

139
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,650
serve thousands tens of thousands of

140
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,319
users who use lo  ro services

141
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,379
and instead of those of google and

142
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:39,810
company of the latter speaking very

143
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,090
trivially of letter pad to share

144
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,590
a text of ramadan which is the alternative

145
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,279
doodle a series of tools that

146
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,169
we all use a type every day

147
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:52,740
but almost

148
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,729
and this gene  the tools that

149
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:58,139
help us in our daily life

150
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,680
on the internet is instead of using

151
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,319
the common classic platforms

152
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,419
to enrich data information

153
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,039
and these platforms

154
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,159
here an alternative is offered by

155
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:14,159
virtue of the fact that over the years this is the

156
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:16,710
platform offered by fra ma soft  it has

157
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,990
expanded has become more and more popular

158
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,050
in more recent times they have asked themselves the

159
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,599
problem of and we ourselves are

160
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,430
becoming a training silos and

161
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,830
this is not good at all

162
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,990
clearly they are very far from being

163
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,490
the size of google but they have

164
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,409
posed this problem  del however they

165
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:36,419
are centralizing in turn

166
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,219
information from thousands of

167
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:41,020
users therefore

168
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,840
on the ma  net ago,

169
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,449
the pious contribution appeal was launched which

170
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:52,300
essentially is an invitation to cost

171
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,389
in turn alternative platforms and

172
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,379
services to be used in minor contexts,

173
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,780
therefore for one's own personal use or

174
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,120
for one's friends one's

175
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,250
work colleagues one's association

176
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,190
the team  in short,

177
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,759
we, you geeks who are

178
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,650
able to put on a server with

179
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,259
some application installed above,

180
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,150
take care of this

181
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,150
burden in our infinitely small and

182
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,240
help to decentralize the

183
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,510
internet precisely to or to offer an alternative

184
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,340
to the services already  existing in order to

185
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,380
distribute unpack what is

186
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,080
the information that all of us produce

187
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,090
all of us that our friends acquaintances

188
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,770
produce every day

189
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,080
I repeat the appeal was launched about

190
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,630
a year ago

191
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,450
recently Italians and red site

192
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,150
wanted to respond to this appeal by

193
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,070
putting  online distance services

194
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,260
puntolino cue it that precisely f  to

195
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,480
this is a platform on which you

196
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,420
sign up there are a series of tools

197
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,250
available and the purpose of this is not

198
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,450
as well as the purpose of the wrong purchase is not to

199
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,610
tell you from all used

200
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,800
services point point it I don't give a

201
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,870
damn indeed more people  uses more

202
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,370
resources is occupied on servers that

203
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,320
small therefore not used by the

204
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,210
prior 2 just for all days

205
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,400
the fundamental purpose of

206
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,000
this initiative is to provide

207
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,780
a test the possibility of trying

208
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,850
firsthand in this case

209
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,370
an instance of sandstorm  which is in

210
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,920
turn is an application that facilitates the

211
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,710
fact of being or star service

212
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,980
applications and then give a server

213
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,870
ver that linux virgin with a couple of

214
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,070
scripts and he was getting everything

215
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,900
necessary to put up a

216
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,720
web interface from which I can  select is

217
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,490
my inter pa seen my tercals that

218
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,910
installs me we can and installs my series

219
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,880
of

220
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,720
web applications available and then with little

221
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,130
effort you can obtain  Neither a platform

222
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,160
that offers already exposes the whole series of

223
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,440
tools that can again be

224
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,720
used for personal purposes or

225
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,180
above all shared with other

226
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,120
people with whom we have to deal even

227
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,209
outside the purely

228
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:24,019
technical and technological sphere therefore

229
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:27,240
the invitation that  I ask you as it

230
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,910
was indirectly placed to me gives form

231
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,060
soft

232
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,180
dat take a tour on this services dot

233
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,730
ios dotit take a look at the

234
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,150
documentation of sandstorm or some

235
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,800
other similar solution there are also

236
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,200
others that is a host and others and

237
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,820
consider putting

238
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,300
yourself in

239
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,870
charge of accusing make the effort to use and make

240
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,160
the even greater effort to make

241
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,800
use of alternatives to what are

242
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,649
the common and tragic services that alas

243
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:12,889
everyone all uses and unfortunately

244
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:16,760
we all use I was quite short

245
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,130
so more  previously there are questions

246
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,709
questions doubts perplexity about what I

247
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:30,019
said that now there are social agents

248
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:33,470
who in fact c  he it's very easy to

249
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,980
use google doc it's very easy to use

250
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,680
dropbox because everyone has it

251
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,240
everyone is already using it so they don't have to

252
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,810
install a new application there are

253
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,029
you pest social incentives

254
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:48,260
to make people use such services

255
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,880


256
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,620
some social mechanism

257
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,399
some tool that is not

258
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,660
merely technical because it seems to me that

259
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,610
the problem is not technical or a cloud

260
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,649
exists and works and the pale

261
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:05,149
works I understand it is clear it is clear that

262
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:07,790
obviously there is the force of habit

263
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,120
made of convenient above all the

264
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,399
fact that everyone uses google

265
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,270
docs for just to name one

266
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,740
they all use it and therefore

267
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,720
the use also I do me all the

268
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,250
authentications does all the things I

269
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,660
share with whoever I want etc.

270
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,740
etc. is that very convenient to

271
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,030
use in  this nothing to say

272
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,690
also efficient comfortable and practical there is a

273
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,880
lot of functionality this namely

274
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,089
[Music]

275
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:37,110
amazing that I can understand

276
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,730
this attitude towards

277
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,760
those who are not from

278
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,770
the circle in short, those who have never even

279
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,950
raised the problem of privacy and

280
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,360
anything else but I repeat to by virtue of

281
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,530
what I said before the problem

282
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,010
is always posing person I do not

283
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,740
understand how ourselves  and we

284
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,160
people in this event in

285
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,590
this room who in any case already have a

286
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,680
vague idea of what this thing is even

287
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,960
to share a very banal text file,

288
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,690
maybe even without protections and

289
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,980
anything else I want to share a file

290
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,100
a text with the people who are here I

291
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,240
I need a stuff online to

292
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,390
publish it on google docs that I

293
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,530
do absolutely nothing is fine

294
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,890
even an instance a direct instance but

295
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,790
this this this this thing is aimed

296
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,140
above all at me and us the fact that

297
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,899
we have a vague awareness knowledge

298
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,720
of what it implies  this

299
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,709
after which also here the fact of

300
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:44,829
using it first of all us and it is already a

301
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:48,129
huge step towards

302
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:51,839
what we daily see  edo

303
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,529
and online the next step I repeat

304
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:57,380
even more difficult is to make

305
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,300
use of close people

306
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,160
but I tell you

307
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,290
very trivially made use of Egyptians

308
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,569
which is the platform for making

309
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:08,560
videoconferences that he knows well

310
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,120
in fact use gizzi to make

311
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,310
black hole videocall and quant  'more

312
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,990
how many times the customer writes to

313
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,060
me telling me come on let's talk on skype this

314
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,430
is my brain and whatever else

315
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,420
time the media has arrived I have already

316
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,160
sent the link that just click it and

317
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,290
we are already scoring

318
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,410
in that case there is the convenience of the

319
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,720
tool  free and open and even

320
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,750
superior to that of the

321
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,939
closed and commercial solution and so on

322
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:40,639
so there are cases where it is easy

323
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,980
because obviously at an

324
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,129
overall immediate convenience by anyone who

325
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:47,449
does not have the slightest idea of what

326
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:48,829
we are talking about and there are cases in  to which

327
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:53,389
there is a cultural effort to be applied

328
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:57,639
I repeat for once in the first place by us

329
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,860
hello sorry I'm not at all

330
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:09,199
technical but by choice  my ethics doses I

331
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,630
do not use whatsapp someone me the

332
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,540
million people who know me tell me about

333
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,110
all the colors

334
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,069
you will have mouse I do not do it in time of the

335
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:25,699
day

336
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:29,389
responds from everyone and because I am malicious

337
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:31,790
because it is difficult to intercept I

338
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,750
want to be interpreted everything

339
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,750
I say is  legal moral ethical and everything

340
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,199
if they intercept my problem they

341
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:45,079
will feel like pilots on the edge

342
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:48,610
or jokes but it is nothing

343
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,620
interceptible so how can I

344
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,040
find something alternative whatsapp

345
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,389
so widespread is that people can

346
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:03,069
accept that I want to use too

347
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:09,019
lecce the  question 4 different answers the

348
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,149
first we say that on the

349
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:14,720
social network question I can understand why I can

350
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,199
understand that writing something on

351
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,370
twitter if different to different who

352
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,779
will write his mastodon precisely because the

353
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,129
purpose of the social network is to have an

354
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:24,350
audience where the public is not there  is not

355
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,250


356
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,439
gonna stay [ __ ] so i can understand i can understand the

357
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:29,089
social network context in which they

358
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,069
apply of  namics different different purposes

359
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:31,910


360
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,920
if I can share a text in the

361
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,630
same way on google docs on

362
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,199
heather pad

363
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:38,660
actually I cannot share the

364
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,870
same cannot implement the same

365
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,769
dynamics on whatsapp is on matrix or

366
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:49,170
any other

367
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,170
absurd alternative communication network said

368
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,510
this next level

369
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,080
in  It is known that

370
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,000
telegram has much fewer users but in

371
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,250
any case extremely widespread there are

372
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,950
many public administration services, including public ones

373
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,880
that are

374
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,400
provided with a critical telegram a measure

375
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,859
of what is actually used

376
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,560
I repeat it is not extended as cut off but

377
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,359
is still quite rooted

378
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,390
and it is quite reasonable to invite

379
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,160
someone to use telegram with all

380
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,140
the defects who has telegram anyway with

381
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,700
all the defects that anyway also

382
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,720
telegram but in any case it is a step forward

383
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,709
answer number 3

384
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,510
a dear friend and supporter of signal

385
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,960
who knows that it was yet another

386
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,510
communication tool platform a little

387
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,750
safer  from pun  from the point of view of

388
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,290
communication a bit and a bit questionable

389
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,270
about software distribution policies

390
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,830
but this is all born speech

391
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,470
he had the brilliant idea of last

392
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,210
year when he had a daughter all

393
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,470
those who wanted to see the photo of his

394
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,940
daughter he distributed them only on

395
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,800
sites  since relatives friends have all

396
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,620
installed initials a number of

397
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,810
users in the Brescia area of signal has

398
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,360
increased by 50 60 units in the space of a

399
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,590
few weeks and therefore here there is indeed

400
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,620
the incentive the social cultural incentive

401
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,670
to use this kind of

402
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:20,960
platforms become a daughter  theme of a

403
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,320
lot of children

404
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,090
share photos to friends relatives

405
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,940
only on Mr. or on his

406
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,970
platform that you prefer

407
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,240
so it is not easy I realize the

408
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,440
compromise

409
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,909
the miur at this moment I think it is

410
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,860
telegrah I repeat with all the problems that

411
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,899
telegram has but  it is quite reasonable to

412
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:45,250
invite someone

413
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,760
on large tele rather than going to

414
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,640
fit and going up on whatsapp is a

415
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:59,380
first pas  I know at least not many

416
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,260
many I have many in many countries

417
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,470
where the various checks are in force

418
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,380
to the true state censorship

419
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,860
very often whatsapp and shoes are not

420
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,960
blocked by the government of the great yes

421
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,940
because whatsapp and shots are

422
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,870
interceptible

423
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:25,540
no no  is this thing wrong or not I

424
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,920
do not hide no it is just

425
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,950
the wrong attitude because it

426
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,720
means that you justify the fact that

427
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,890
your affairs are public

428
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,030
traced but different to implement the curtains

429
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,380
remove no began to us tend to

430
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,910
your house not  there are and there are windows

431
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,180
so open a door the bathroom there is in

432
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,400
your house

433
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:58,010
remove there there is an entrance door

434
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:05,600
that yours I don't know the question

435
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,190
exactly that

436
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,200
i have nothing to hide i am not

437
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,520
exactly like that  sure you have

438
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,900
nothing to hide

439
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,230
there are facts it will be a quantum it is fact that

440
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,810
you would be embarrassed to let the

441
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,640
public know maybe you know me

442
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,980
but yes we all have something to

443
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,200
hide

444
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,120
from the sock hole  due to

445
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:35,100
the fact that snores to the fact that all

446
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:43,410
all things the dog credit for example

447
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,690
again the number hiding is not a

448
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,270
not exactly what I

449
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,460
would expect that is not exactly

450
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,620
attitude that I will like I like to

451
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,690
see to show you why in the end

452
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,800
all  how many we have something to

453
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,220


454
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,670
hide without our knowledge

455
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,020
if you do not have something to hide now

456
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,160
because now it is not a problem it

457
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,100
could be s it could be

458
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,860
tomorrow is in the meantime it has been recorded

459
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,590
that I know I will give you an example

460
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,660
that I always like to bring when it lasts

461
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,890
first  of the second world war

462
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,590
the holland made a census to

463
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,350
know the religion of its citizens

464
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,630
to give a proper burial correct

465
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,430
burial in case there were no

466
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,170
friendly relatives who could decide

467
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,190
for the deceased

468
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,140
what happened that the

469
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,240
Nazis arrived these  registers were there at the

470
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,470
time it is true I have nothing to

471
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,450
hide but when the Nazis arrive

472
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,100
home sky something to be born

473
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,100
When the registry office went on fire

474
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,790


475
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,010
the firefighters took it very calmly

476
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,570
because even they understood that

477
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,830
those documents were better if they

478
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,800
did not exist so now there is nothing

479
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,630
to hide tomorrow who knows

480
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,700
now you have a basically

481
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,680
democratic government  tomorrow who knows,

482
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,050
tomorrow it becomes illegal to have that

483
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,570
beard or have had that beard

484
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,360
in

485
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,000
the past you are screwed because now there

486
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,410
are your photos on the internet

487
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,660
I do not want my photo on the internet

488
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,870
if I can tend to so that is

489
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,429
why it is not there  did not want to hide

490
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:20,870
wrong a lot of points of view

491
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,690
this is one this more political fiction

492
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,440
but they are reasons to have something to

493
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,640
hide there is something to hide

494
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,920
wanting now the credit card example

495
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,750
was stupid because if I find out

496
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,130
your card number  credit can

497
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,410
actually do you a damage that does not

498
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,000
depend on privacy

499
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,650
but for example my

500
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,660
political orientation I say I want  I

501
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,450
do not want it to be in the public domain first

502
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,070
because then I can be tagged

503
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,020
advertising on there are things that

504
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,340
we have seen lately are not

505
00:22:49,340 --> 00:23:09,559
news ok but I can not but I can not here in fact I

506
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,710


507
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:25,679
conclude quickly that it was

508
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,929
already long the problem is a lot  I'm

509
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:32,009
the next one who does it all by not living

510
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:41,190
thanks then the problem is that

511
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,210
you can't do this

512
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,859
retroactively once your

513
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:46,049
privacy has been violated and it's

514
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:46,799
over

515
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,779
you can't take back the information it's

516
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:51,749
gone so I would think about it enough

517
00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:54,570
before saying I have nothing to

518
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,989
hide read you lightly

519
00:23:56,989 --> 00:24:00,169
but you don't need to bully it is

520
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:07,049
not needed but it is not needed so far 50

521
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:08,220
years ago it was perfectly

522
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,499
acceptable to pinch a girl on the ass

523
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:13,349
when she was passing by the office if

524
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:16,139
it is  if there are documents that show

525
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:17,009
that 50 years ago

526
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:19,109
maybe 50 years you no but in short that

527
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:21,139
someone 50 years ago did it is

528
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:22,830
ruined now this  it is a

529
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,169
negative example but in the sense there are things that

530
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:27,840
cancel society changes and the errors

531
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,759
of the past if they are recorded are

532
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,070
recorded at the end I prefer that they are not

533
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,369
