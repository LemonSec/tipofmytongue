1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:05,640
what we see today starts from a

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,900
small premise you feel so much that they

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,820
are radio amateurs was tamers they are born

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,090
with we want marconi that the first

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,910
radiomators ever do several

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,699
things that we will not see all of them today because it is

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,140
impossible what we will see today is

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,699
the use of the radio

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,800
in the mode  digital i.e. sending

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,870
digital data to three using the radio which

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,989
is an analog grade brick instrument

12
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,670
however they also do contests which are

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,809
ex competitions which are long

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,420
distance links today here we received a signal

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,600
that came from a duo which is a

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,320
scattered islet  in the peaceful that is experimentation

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,850
and of all kinds because coaches have

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,280
frequencies practically ranging from the

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,989
hf that are around let's say from 0 to

20
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,570
247 giga they have a series of

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,000
frequency slices that are usable make

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,090
satellite connections m that whoever

23
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,860
came to les that two  years ago he was able to

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,540
see live connections via

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,720
d'una using the moon as a mirror

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,250
sent to the signals  radios on the moon

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,049
bounce back from another

28
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,490
part of the earth like America which are

29
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,560
the most extreme connections that

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,530
radio amateurs can do and a whole series

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,520
of things including civil protection

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,290


33
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,240
for those who do not know but the  event

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,340
last year that happened in the mountains

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,150
that pulled down all the trees to

36
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,240
give you an idea for two days also pulled

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,280
down not only the trees but also

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,070
the connectivity landline and

39
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,829
mobile telephony for two days the

40
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,630
only connections  initials were

41
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,579
through the points of the dema tori which are not

42
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,590
the only active ones because they work

43
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,540
through batteries solar panels and do not

44
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,390
work with the beta 2

45
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,219
that the trees falling down

46
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,730
systematically I said before

47
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,290
the purpose of this tall kalakh and we

48
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,360
only have 30 minutes is to  understand what

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,849
how to transmit in the meantime a

50
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:21,870
digital signal in a signal in a

51
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,629
radio that accepts only voice so

52
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,290
an analog signal in fact I was saying

53
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,269
before is co  mpiuta only know 0 and 1

54
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:34,400
while radios only understand audio

55
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,390
in digital systems these here are the

56
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,530
various digital systems that exist and

57
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,840
I wanted to keep it at the end but logical already

58
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,910
now because you see the first

59
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,829
ever the first communication

60
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:52,220
ever which is  it was done in the

61
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,079
radio field it was not analog but it was

62
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,319
digital because the first communications

63
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,660
were the clamps that we call

64
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,730
double food but the mors in fact is a

65
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,859
digital communication all the rest

66
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:11,190
are the various names that have been

67
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,600
given to the various communications  digital

68
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,989
how they work in essence the modes

69
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,269
are basically two one is to

70
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:27,359
use some tones for example two tones to

71
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:30,630
identify zero one around zero

72
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,530


73
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,930
a low frequency or zero and el 1

74
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,090
, alternating depending on the

75
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,980
case inside the radio all  'inside the

76
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,069
radio these two tones so the computer

77
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:45,829
is able through the sound card to

78
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:49,410
translate the bits into tones and send them on the

79
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,819
radio from the other  part to do exactly

80
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,549
the opposite so it will take the two

81
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:54,959
frequencies according to the two frequencies it

82
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,730
will translate into 0 in 1 the other possibility is

83
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,860
that of

84
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,850
I don't know if you have seen before

85
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,730
basically the place of using a

86
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,740
frequency what is

87
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,200
called the phase invasion is used

88
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,790
if you look in absolute terms and at a certain

89
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,710
point when it reaches zero it

90
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,190
goes down and then rises again when there is a

91
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,230
change of state, that is when there is a

92
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,670
transition from 0 to 1 to 1 to 0 instead

93
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,720
of making it go down

94
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,400
we pretend that we are on the side  going

95
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
uphill I bring the sinusoid down we bring it back

96
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,310
to another

97
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,190
time the computer when you see that the

98
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,169
sine wave comes up again it knows that

99
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:38,900
if it has not become one at 0 before evening 11 it

100
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,000
becomes zero if there is no change

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,890
say  that the beat that was

102
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,630
previous continues to be valid

103
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,790
so if before there was one of the axes

104
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,090
muzzle ride the next one is automatically perfect the

105
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,230
one after is one of

106
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,820
these

107
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,950
systems most not corrected

108
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,310
error means that during the

109
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,090
transmission,

110
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,280
if someone

111
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,320
has a disturbance that can be of

112
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,860
any type and that bit is lost

113
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,490
automatically the wine is received

114
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,530
the communication between the party will have

115
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,480
a letter, for example, wrong

116
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,480
so instead of writing hello you will see co2  has

117
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,180
a strange character

118
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,770
others instead have the

119
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,620
error correction for which what you see is

120
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,990
automatically valid or if it is not

121
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,780
valid but you simply see it some

122
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,650
of these systems are born even earlier they

123
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:44,180
are born much earlier than you

124
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,110
think because for example the package

125
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,290
is  of the 80s I in the eighties

126
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,570
end of the eighties I sent mail

127
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,560
through the radio

128
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,180
indeed in 92 mail in the internet sense in

129
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,050
87 88 they were the ones that were the

130
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,180
old bbs only they were done via

131
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,940
radio and had a

132
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,490
communication interchange system including via

133
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,280
satellite so if I wanted to send

134
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,100
a message in an American

135
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,650
there was one of the stations in Italy that

136
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,270
took the  message and they sent it

137
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,580
satellite at the top which always gives it

138
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,229
material which when it passed

139
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:28,729
on the orbit of the American and

140
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:34,450
downloaded it we are talking about the 80s

141
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,570
this that now we see them a little

142
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,640
more in detail is what has

143
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,200
become  what you have

144
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,390
now because the computer with a radio

145
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,200
corresponds exactly to your

146
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,680
mobile phone your mobile phone uses

147
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,620
more complex systems than these but

148
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,560
which rely on these to send

149
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,930
data is yours is nothing more than a

150
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,630
computer connected to a radio  that the

151
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,729
telephone another than a radio is the

152
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:07,479
same identical thing

153
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,740
then the ps chief and the one I was talking about

154
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,360
one of the systems that was born with

155
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,150
the phase inversion

156
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,969
each of these protocols to advantages

157
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,299
today and to its use one of the advantages of

158
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:23,329
psk  and that they use very low bandwidth it

159
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:25,279
means that on a spectrum of a

160
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,309
radio channel that is 3 kg hearts and there can

161
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:29,749
be

162
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,389
many stations therefore on the same

163
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:34,299
channel that you hear

164
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:35,899
normal audio  ally with a human ear

165
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:39,679
you can make many connections many

166
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:41,749
connections

167
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:43,789
the packet I said before

168
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,919
in the eighties I did then in not

169
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,069
until 94 which shows how old

170
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,849
I was I was able to do data transfer

171
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,059
I did ftp at that time ethernet in

172
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,899
92 94 on fu  net point fi and I downloaded

173
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:02,360
software at the speed of 9,600 bull

174
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,709
per second which via radio in simplex is an

175
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:10,459
abnormal slowness but I had a

176
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,860
great advantage that you could see

177
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,259
very well the land sheikh packages of the

178
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:17,779
tpp looking at it monitor you could see

179
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:20,119
very well because it was so slow that

180
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:22,009
one was able to  learn very well the

181
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,349
protocol done in itself worked well for

182
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:29,059
that the Greek incomes and what

183
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:32,899
is commonly teletypewriter the

184
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,839
classic teleprinter sent two tones

185
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,969
that corresponded to 0 and 1 via

186
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:39,828
telephony telephone lines

187
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:42,469
thus called to the Greek incomes nothing more than

188
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:44,689
radio tele tape so it is the

189
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:46,939
radio teletypewriter this is

190
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:48,800
still used today as a method of

191
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,559
co  communication also the package we will see

192
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,389
later with an application that saw you

193
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:58,279
first on the map the ss tv is still

194
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,290
used and 3 allows you to transmit

195
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:05,740
images through the radio

196
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,950
it was once used a lot now much

197
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,440
less internet talk

198
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,080
but practically a line  at a time

199
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
this too uses sounds each sound

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,570
practically identifies the color because it

201
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,600
sends color images the color and

202
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,430
the intensity of the color

203
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,070
the tv is basically the

204
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,360
digital television broadcast the same you see

205
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,340
for television only that uses the

206
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,380
frequencies of radio amateurs from mine  point

207
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,440
of view it is not very interesting

208
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,820
technologically because it is nothing more than

209
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,370
the television technology brought

210
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,090
to the facsal radio field by now it has no longer

211
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,270
used, but here too it is the

212
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,000
gray scale and each frequency corresponded to a

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,340
level of gray

214
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,460
this thing is still used in hf

215
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,050
for ships, sending images

216
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,240
of weather reports is still

217
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,820
useful  a still to the Greek rtt and the fax

218
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,590
as protocol has not yet been

219
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,130
eliminated

220
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,200
so there are people who still receive in

221
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,260
these systems in the naval field with motor

222
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,220
factor is nothing more than a system

223
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,680
something similar to the puckett only it has done

224
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,330
on systems where  there is a lot of noise that

225
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,950
are the hf bands where there are a lot of

226
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,950
radio disturbances and this allowed to

227
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,400
have very low speeds but to

228
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,930
be much safer as

229
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,380
speed as a connection the pack tor is

230
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,450
still used now because you have no

231
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,730
money to buy the famous  I think it's

232
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,070
called stress in ships but he wants to

233
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,000
do it transatlantic transatlantic

234
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,950
this system allows you to send e-mails

235
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,860
small messages to give the position

236
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,910
of where you are without having to buy

237
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,890
we are about 3 400 euros against I don't know

238
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,570
how many thousands of euros to buy the

239
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,680
system  stress and via satellite

240
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,880
the others are still used but by

241
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,040
now they are losing in on another

242
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,410
protocol that we see after this the

243
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,550
prs premises prac  using the

244
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,740
protocol you have seen before the

245
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,580
radio packet is usually 1200 bits per

246
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,720
second to send data that is a

247
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,180
position of the car or

248
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,279
this one you see right now is

249
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,700
really on the highway is sending

250
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,500
data and via radio it is received by

251
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,420
some station in the Veneto and

252
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,850
is transmitted via the network on the server which

253
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,640
transmits the data here then at 12 to

254
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,490
14 and 21 that is two minutes ago he was

255
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,400
going at 131 kilometers per hour and he was

256
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,080
on that road there in that direction

257
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,810
this is the  'image of course not in

258
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,700
real time but it is what is shown

259
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,570
google street view

260
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,430
this image is now

261
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,800
sent a new position and he this

262
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,600
position is sent via radio from

263
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,120
his car not via mobile phone is

264
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,040
received by one of the many

265
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,930
mountain repeaters which  they transmit the

266
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,270
signal on stations that are on the ground

267
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,130
which have internet days transmit via the

268
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,380
internet a server which we are

269
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,120
connected to and c  i send this

270
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,230
public thing you can see it too

271
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,680
this is one of the great this thing here

272
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,450
not via internet and of course but only

273
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,420
via radio existed in 92 this thing

274
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,149
that you see now you say is normal

275
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,290
in 92 and I can assure

276
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,720
normal already existed and was done

277
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,209
exclusively via radio

278
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,470
then with the advent of the internet they

279
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,779
put things together the only difference

280
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:55,019
is that while via radio there were 3 400

281
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,690
kilometers of radius by attacking the internet

282
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,050
here you have the opportunity to see the

283
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,060
whole world the example

284
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,459
at that time I do not already have  thought about

285
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:06,980
sending small messages

286
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,959
now I could be in the car via

287
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,880
radio in america write a message

288
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,899
with my radio at 1 that here is this

289
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,399
here through the internet then

290
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,649
through the radio link so the two

291
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:21,509
machines have no internet they can

292
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:29,810
receive the message  this

293
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,069
basically useful civil protection in the

294
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:33,420
case of civil protection that I can

295
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,519
know the teams where they are I can

296
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,509
put the tags

297
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:39,720
myself for evi  dentiare I give the example

298
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,620
I put the tag

299
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,280
if you look at the blue line this blue line

300
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,080
this is the path I took

301
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,540
this morning to come here and

302
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,110
I put the tent and to identify the esc

303
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,700
so here is mine  car both

304
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,200
the tent and a lescot offense and then i

305
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,670
can also put points and say

306
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,340
this is a fire and i see where

307
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,020
my teams are

308
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,250
now it's back to the car because i

309
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,050
told follow the car i don't know

310
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,580
where it's going but it's going  it is on the

311
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,500
a13 that he is going to bologna of

312
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,240
course his data is voluntary

313
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,010
so it is not that we are going

314
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,960
to steal his privacy

315
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,150
as I said before in the example of

316
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,520
Greek income

317
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,819
[Music]

318
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:41,069
that now tamed that the first

319
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:44,370
line on the right where  there is 2.295 they

320
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,100
correspond to zero 2.125 corresponds

321
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,100
to 1 the second discriminating the two

322
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,269
frequencies see one and the other

323
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,800
this is the last protocol that we see

324
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,360
indeed the penultimate and it is the one born in

325
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,310
recent years and is now the most  ù used

326
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,720
is called jets because the inventor is

327
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,940
john taylor who is also a nobel prize winner

328
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,790
and who also studied it

329
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,709
himself or quite complex protocol

330
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:17,970
where he can analyze while with

331
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,589
our old human I don't know if you have ever

332
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:21,779
listened to the  radio but there is a

333
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,449
background rustle when the signal reaches

334
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:27,120
below levels it is difficult to understand

335
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,970
the audio this system allows you to

336
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,550
understand the 0 to 1 even much under the

337
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,889
rustle by analyzing the rustle

338
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:38,430
because by doing it in a simple way the

339
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,560
rustle is  always behaves in the same

340
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,730
way by

341
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,220
taking it into pieces when rustling in some

342
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,779
pieces behaves

343
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,399
differently than usual it means that

344
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,779
obviously there is some signal by

345
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,639
analyzing this signal

346
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,449
in an algorithm way it manages to go much

347
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:57,600
under noise so the a donors a

348
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,500
are  making connections in which you

349
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,990
hear nothing by ear and the radio

350
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,730
can hear that is, the protocol

351
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,480
can hear the bad thing about this is

352
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,439
that  it only transmits in 47 to people the 65

353
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:17,639
that I was the basic protocol transmits 13

354
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,050
characters in 47 seconds because there is a

355
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:28,230
repetition it takes 47 seconds the last

356
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:34,819
that the ft4 takes less than 15 seconds

357
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,820
the only difference is that everything is

358
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,530
done by the computer  let's say that there is little

359
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,060
inter in this protocol there is little

360
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,570
human inter activity

361
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,980
also because at the error control

362
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,870
for which the name you see per

363
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:54,690
se is right is free from errors as

364
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,870
I said before now here a little technical

365
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,230
count that on the left  there are the modes ss

366
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:07,290
vivo of le voice cw is the mors and then there are

367
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,380
all the various protocols jt invented by

368
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,740
this one remember that every three of b

369
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,869
that is, every time there is a 3 of b more

370
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:22,140
is double than before so when  passed

371
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,190
from minus 8 or minus 15

372
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,460
are three p three plus three so 9

373
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,240
db less then is the after is twice

374
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,160
less plus twice less than twice

375
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,410
less than the signal heard than the

376
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:41,450
one try to imagine 30db 30db and a

377
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:48,350
thousand times less  signal above the

378
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,909
connection for

379
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,000
the radio connection is very simple

380
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,410
because basically you can also

381
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,660
connect the audio output directly to

382
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,660
the computer's microphone

383
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,910
to the audio output, thus inverting

384
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,760
the microphone output, the

385
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,470
computer's microphone input goes to

386
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,250


387
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,520
the radio's speaker output  and vice versa for

388
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,260
disability not recommended usually

389
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,030
an interface is used to separate

390
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,770
let's say to destroy the computer

391
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,150
even if in reality it is not quite so

392
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:30,250
for which an interface that

393
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,520
looks like this is made wisely are 15

394
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,820
euros of sky material the material

395
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,440
also  less this is done

396
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,030
basically you are able with radio

397
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,150
and a computer to use everything

398
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,620
we have seen before so maybe

399
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,290
there was a fax to see the greek networks but

400
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,430
in the 80s and 90s the

401
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,800
press agencies in Greek tt areas worked a lot so

402
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,600
i omitting to play Greek tt I saw

403
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,880
all the news agencies that I would

404
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,640
see in the evening then indeed many I did not

405
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,280
see the  I saw me but they did not come on the

406
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,730
news because they were not considered

407
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,620
interesting as I said before the

408
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,900
oldest digital way ever is the

409
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,070
mors that we tamers call cw which

410
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,770
is not dead in the sense that from the point of

411
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,170
view of the buddha radio amateurs

412
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,650
commercial point of view was  removed in 2004 2003

413
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,710
2004 it was mandatory because it was

414
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,790


415
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,970


416
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,330
radio operator in ships now it is basically used by radio amateurs to a digital system

417
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,740
with human decoding you will say

418
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,030
computer decoding exists

419
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,730
yes but for now no software

420
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,700
equals the human ear

421
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,740
at this moment the human ear is

422
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,090
able is the best of

423
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,669
course if the person who listens to

424
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:06,620
drool is the best tool to

425
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,699
decode the boss

426
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,900
the software exists unlike the

427
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,059
man who manages to configure 1 to

428
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:21,059
the best two at the same time the

429
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,720
computer can decode

430
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,970
a whole series of them all at once

431
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,610
however the difference that is very wrong

432
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,200
because a disturbance is enough and a line

433
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,899
becomes a point m  while the man is

434
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,880
able to guess that they have trouble

435
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,679
then to say no was still a line

436
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,809
in this case no only to specify

437
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,330
that in the morse you do not listen to the points

438
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,299
and lines but you hear sounds and I

439
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,710
say cool sounds that is  when I morse

440
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,590
cw whoever wants later can come and

441
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,380
listen

442
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,080
because I will do a kind of contest

443
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,350
whereby whoever wants to see how a

444
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,600
contest works and how the food feels afterwards can

445
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,050
come is welcome but you can listen to sounds

446
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,900
so some music for me is a  z I

447
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,570
remember that line line point point not

448
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,040
because I remember that lines years exactly

449
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,230
point but because I played the sound as

450
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,750
I remember on the brain translated it in

451
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,180
line and points because I the translation

452
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,630
sound letter the translation points lines

453
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:35,270
letter or numbers is advantageous for two

454
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,740
reasons the first because it is

455
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,940
useless no computers are needed for

456
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,060
decoding use the best computer that

457
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,770
exists in the world that your brain

458
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,870
the second is that to also carry out the

459
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,480
transmit  tore is simpler ever

460
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,280
because it is a transmitter to a

461
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,040
transmitter off

462
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,750
no modulation is needed no type of

463
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,660
system is needed i.e. amplifier on

464
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,340
transmitter switched on by liar

465
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,350
off so it is also very easy to

466
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,080
do for that

467
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,580
more is instead absolute

468
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:12,699
to ask questions

469
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,000
yes

470
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,419
good morning I wanted to ask you

471
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:36,520
regarding this transcoding from

472
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,340
line points to sounds it means that you have perfect

473
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,870
pitch can do it even a

474
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,340
person who does not have

475
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,549
this type of fishing hear hear me yes

476
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:47,850
thank you of

477
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:52,529
course one  that he is deaf or not but

478
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:56,770
then I have to be honest I have done and

479
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,250
am making a circuit for a person

480
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:04,000
where he has to make the lenses fi cative the

481
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,450
bite and to try it yes how to be

482
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,309
a wait makes a led light up to

483
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:11,620
see if it works and I must say that  even

484
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,860
with the led I can understand that is you

485
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,539
can understand the letter it takes a

486
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:19,350
bit of practice as I did which

487
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,110
is not like learning a language  ua to an

488
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,520
interesting thing about the vice which is a

489
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,100
very simplified language of its own tanks and tnx

490
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,659
so there is a whole series of words and

491
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:34,649
there are people who are 90 years old

492
00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:36,940
speak to any part of the world and

493
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,250
do not know a letter of English

494
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,679
that is not  they know English but they can

495
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,600
speak to each other quietly the four

496
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,059
basic information that are where I live

497
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:48,820
the time that there is here the apparatus that to the

498
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,559
antenna that now these things are

499
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,539
spoken quietly here and do not

500
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:55,210
know English is a language that

501
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,149
basically are  words in english

502
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:02,559
not really all simplified times

503
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,600
so they are two three letters four at

504
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,080
most

505
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,830
gl good lg ego di weening

506
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,570
all these things here so when I

507
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,880
learned those he can speak to

508
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,799
communicate with any part of the world

509
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,059
without having to know the language other

510
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:22,020
questions if in the meantime  thanks for the talk

511
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,390
when I was on fidonet and therefore I was a

512
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,809
victim of the urban tariff time I was

513
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:32,919
constantly wondering if there was

514
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:36,370
economic convenience  a in transmitting

515
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,320
data via radio

516
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,669
what he is doing today render

517
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:44,900
transmission a gigabit

518
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,230
a megabit I am talking about the

519
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,810
nineties via radio there was a radio amateur

520
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,520
who share who had made a

521
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,460
2 megabit giga and 2 megabit modem and was done

522
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,500
quietly as  data transfer

523
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,030
worked in the same way as

524
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,820
fidonet that is you had your bbs your

525
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,600
local tnc that is

526
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,679
your station point to be able to communicate

527
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,350
with the various bbsi bbs between them they

528
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,320
talked through bridges they

529
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,119
transmitted signal then

530
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,659
and then there were transfers  of the

531
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:22,829
points that did the transfers

532
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:25,439
what they do today with the wifi of

533
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:26,879
course the vegetarian much

534
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:28,829
lower that time but the exact same

535
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:29,519
thing

536
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:31,919
I did ftp because that time the web

537
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,919
did not exist ftp and telnet

538
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,549
basically effects here to

539
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:37,499
download the programs with comic dot

540
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:41,099
fi  that at the beginning it was had everything

541
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:44,189
imaginable from home I launched it on

542
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:46,229
saturday it was an hour to download a

543
00:25:46,229 --> 00:25:47,909
softwa  re but I went away when I came

544
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:51,179
back I did it and I looked I looked at the

545
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:54,659
news and I looked at the e-mails that in the

546
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,419
years when the internet came out 91 92 the

547
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,299
first mother is more than the apparatus

548
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:02,009
disputes ira donors have a

549
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:05,789
class the 44 bar 8 that  it is dedicated to

550
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:08,279
radio amateurs for whom there were

551
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,899
also gateways that allow from the internet

552
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:13,859
and go inside the bbs vice versa but

553
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:17,219
the apparatus when it came to do that

554
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:19,580
thing there the tmc cost

555
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,080
then if you did it on 50,000 lire 25

556
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,790
euros

557
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:29,240
the radio  you went from a

558
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,660
hundred thousand lire it is used up but with

559
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:39,140
150,000 lire 75 euros about 80 euros you had

560
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,180
everything you needed the antenna

561
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,640
costs and the one you see out there and

562
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,230
cable enough

563
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,840
we should have been there 20 years ago be

564
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,180
careful that the communications could

565
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,980
be made  only between the engines and the

566
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,560
tamers they had a practically

567
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,650
copy network of fidonet only that they were only among

568
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,800
the amateurs to be able to exchange

569
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,510
software messages what you wanted or leave

570
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,000
some tlc that were the modems called  iamole

571
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,580
so they allowed you they had a ram and

572
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,990


573
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,670
a battery so I could

574
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,860
connect directly to your keep us

575
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,500
leave you the message and you had led

576
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,240
that flashed when it comes back

577
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,950
go and read so you live even

578
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,690
now they seem stupid but they are at

579
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,740
that time it is cool

580
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,770
so  all to see of the vice

581
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:35,240
learn it right other questions is below

582
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,059
are the question marks the bites well
