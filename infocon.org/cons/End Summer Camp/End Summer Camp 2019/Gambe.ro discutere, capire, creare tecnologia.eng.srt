1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
today's talk and now talks about

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,970
legs shrimp is a platform that was

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,210
born in the last few months has won in itself it

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,310
was a social bookmarking site that

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,930
is, it is similar to news or lobsters then

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:28,080
kind of sites then first of all a

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,900
site of  social bookmarking that is to say

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,099
if we go to

9
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,920
when we work it looks like we are a

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,590
news site but it is not just the news

11
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,269
we go back to talk

12
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,360
so we said it is a social

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,220
bookmarking site so it looks like new slot

14
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,790
questions the for whom it is made is

15
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,229
mainly made for  technicians that

16
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,790
is basically all those who work

17
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,910
with technology whether by

18
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,520
profession or because they have a purpose, let's say

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,000
more social, which does it precisely for

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,820
those artists who precisely the coach knows

21
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,530
that they make works of art with a

22
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,670
technical meaning  but also politician and

23
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,750
also those who do it for

24
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,300
passion my discussion logo not only

25
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,750
on the technology itself therefore succeeded in

26
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,440
duty by apache

27
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,710
spalmano came out of put set but also

28
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,100
above all  to where we talk about

29
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,230
social, cultural and political discussion on

30
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,570
technology that we will then see in reality is

31
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,340
the focal point of legs that I am not

32
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,070
interested in informing about the latest

33
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,080
events in technology above all

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,190
stimulating the debate in Italian on

35
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,050
we are the most social aspects of what

36
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,830
we do  and ultimately if

37
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,540
we go to who tab is an open

38
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,810
source software has more to contribute both part from

39
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,570
a base and lobsters with the path

40
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,670
taken by the French of newspapers the earth

41
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,580
for a translation is all here we are

42
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,000
however we accept contributions

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,260
we go to the meritorious because sorry a

44
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,380


45
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,140
po because we don't tell you what are the

46
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,030
reasons that led us sinking

47
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,340
if not to make a beautiful

48
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,120
technological information site

49
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,030
the most immediate thing can be precisely

50
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,220
since we have social bookmarking it is a

51
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,830
site that aggregates information also

52
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,230
I hope all in Italian on moderate as

53
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,450
trial you know is not going to

54
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,390
take from the income from this what

55
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:41,359
it's bad indeed I want there legs

56
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,320
the most important thing we want to

57
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,810
do is to create a community of technicians

58
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,760
community in the sense that the Italian world

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,300
of technology there is an agreement in those who

60
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,400
apply 3d on a social level is a

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,650
galaxy enough  fragmented

62
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,180
there are small spaces there is a meeting room

63
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,640
there may be there may be

64
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,100
that the various kant

65
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,570
the great goal of being an

66
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,310
Italian platform and therefore

67
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,310
accessible to all national thing that

68
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,829
can aggregate the technicians who

69
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,500
also deal with the ethical and

70
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,400
social aspects  technology the remaining time a

71
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,890
community of technicians who do not

72
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,490
want to understand that it is the humanities university professors who are talking

73
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,740
about ethics of technology policy who

74
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,199


75
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,419
do not put their hands in

76
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:46,630
technology those already there are

77
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,660
spaces from a new space a space

78
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,940
where even  the technicians also we who

79
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,550
physically put our hands on it can

80
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,830
first of all learn to discover what

81
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,569
are the social aspects of this c  he

82
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:00,669
we do and secondly and

83
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:01,780
share them with others

84
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,190
then videos that you know how we are

85
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,759
doing now at the esc but on a

86
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,659
national scale it is precisely a

87
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:14,409
space in Italian because in

88
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:18,880
Italy there is a lack of spaces where there are few at

89
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,560
least spaces where the  technicians can

90
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,819
talk about these technical topics

91
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:27,090
formitalia in technology for this

92
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,020
html.it where there is the vice that

93
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,210
explained to you that you install there is no yes on

94
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,180
bunt it is needed because I no longer start

95
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,310
for things like this

96
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,710
or they are communities that tend to

97
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,729
be  more exclusively technical not than

98
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:44,889
cultural where there are the opposite we

99
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,090
want to ask for technical support

100
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,639
so if you ask me why it is my

101
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,520
shoulder that we have the thread want

102
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,990
to be sharing news on

103
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:02,639
technology and ideas in the community

104
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,819
built collectively that is the

105
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,440
line that church  it should be set us

106
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,520
comments in founder and to leave

107
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,169
as much as possible that the community

108
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,880
moves on its own ie

109
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,910
I do not want to  To meet the cricket on

110
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,370
how shrimp evolves we will only give a rough

111
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,020
check, that is to say,

112
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,270
do not put technical support or no

113
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:26,960
spam, such

114
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,050
things plus the fundamentals because

115
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,720
I saw that they want it to be something

116
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,340
that develops on its own has not commented in

117
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,860
always gives alone and  deciding in which

118
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,940
direction to develop

119
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,870
therefore the fulcrum of shrimp is the

120
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,920
social cultural and political discussion

121
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,420
because technicians need to have

122
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,320
social discussion because

123
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,970
what we are dealing with we all

124
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,320
deal with that the software is

125
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,490
literally shaping the world more and more every day

126
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,920
where we live there are people

127
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,780
where they interact how they talk

128
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,240
what they do even as a profession in

129
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,330
everyday life and everything shaped by the

130
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,140
software so we cannot limit ourselves to

131
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,580
diego that software development i

132
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,770
see if i see with it that it is

133
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,900
governed  because it makes sure we

134
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,020
asked that aware of our

135
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,540
impact on the world with us a place only

136
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,160
pe  nsa that it is software

137
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,350
finally itself the immense social aspects

138
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,990
the sequence of little

139
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,640
controversial examples we can think

140
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,900
I don't know about the case of facebook with

141
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,990
analytic cambridge where it is the software that has

142
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,789
dealt with influencing the

143
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:47,220
elections and has dealt with collecting user data

144
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,669


145
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:50,910
we can  thinking about always in the context of

146
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,620
facebook frees you therefore a

147
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,930
clear writing that is not just a dream that

148
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,190
expands is changing the

149
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,650
economic equilibrium all over the world

150
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,419
in this sense point they can neglect

151
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,600
social aspects of what a

152
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,690
finger does the software east does not  you don't

153
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,949
need to be a

154
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:10,610
facebook developer for a social change,

155
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,500
even a trivial one that will make you come

156
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
soon esko 1 that no one makes smaller sites

157
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,110
even its small anyway to

158
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,020
an element of a social dimension

159
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,270
let's say so when they speak in

160
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,630
other developers  of a moment in which he

161
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,610
decides what is in his sport

162
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,800
on the question of privacy and whatever

163
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,140
else  dimension that the part on that

164
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,458
level there are also cultural aspects

165
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,500
because they are the direct consequence of

166
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,380
the social ones, that is, as it

167
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,770
shapes life we also lead it by

168
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,670
shaping culture too so

169
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,910
if for example I develop

170
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,520
an instant messaging application that thing changes

171
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,960
one of those  municipalities that have therefore

172
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,130
a different communication culture is created

173
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,570
in this sense we have thus

174
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,190
resolved how we can also change the

175
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,160
culture of Chiusano supporters and

176
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,560
those around them

177
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,150
so much so that for example now we are also talking about

178
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,060
the mainstream of culture to which

179
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,770
therefore for  praise more oriented

180
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,770
towards stability market skills and those

181
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,990
things the seat than the culture silicon

182
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,140
valley therefore more from start-ups more from 20

183
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,750
markets type of world we have

184
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,340
told culture because what

185
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,710
we are producing is actually bait

186
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,920
in the various fields more  more expected let's say

187
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,390
so it

188
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,610
is true that we do not have the software is not

189
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,930
really limited only what

190
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,630
facc  we are all a cultural implication that

191
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,610
is immense immediately to the software same

192
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,410
month then we still have various vague

193
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,150
subcultures thinks about us show that

194
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,540
wall what else we have the world to the

195
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,370
culture of linux users have

196
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:07,890
cultural and then also political aspects

197
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,560
are in case to deepen them

198
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,730
too much  I point because on a

199
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,250
controversial issue and not too welcome in

200
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,350
this sense in the East but also pa I

201
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,240
think there is no need to make an effort to

202
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,460
think about the political aspects in the

203
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,340
software even here we think for example

204
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,860
of the Chinese government has how it uses various

205
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,890
soft functionalities also developed  as

206
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,800
Westerners to control the regions

207
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,700
and swing already in the

208
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,670
most problematic ones we think at random the

209
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,090
elections where this controversy is

210
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,360
about how the social platforms

211
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,300
have accepted or not have said

212
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,060
something about the foreign influence on the

213
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,650
elections in ancient Italy we think

214
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,060
that here without  having detached as much as the

215
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,530
disc up there because it was a controversial

216
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,650
platform  Russian rma is the first fake the

217
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,260
first large-scale case on a

218
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,660
national scale in which technology

219
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,660
actively presents political changes, i.e. it is

220
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,490
a platform that is shaping

221
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,520
the life of the country because in fact

222
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,770
we understand that

223
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,140
very relevant political aspects invents flounder caught

224
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,010
by  many degrees in what he does

225
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,880
managerial not political aspects but

226
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,830
we think we go the workers there will be

227
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,740
a vague for years he works for facebook

228
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,640
also he actually contributes to

229
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,020
influence the politics of the states

230
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,740
so we

231
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,180
a place that these social

232
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,570
cultural aspects exist with each other

233
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,709
the goal is to give a space for

234
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:58,079
discussion between techniques so that we

235
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,630
can discuss them among ourselves so

236
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,380
know what happens in the world in the

237
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,779
world culture know what people think about

238
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,329
some things because for example we can

239
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,630
have it I know it also comes out of the ss  for

240
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,870
this reason this scandal this scandal

241
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,120
are therefore positive and negative

242
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,370
we must know this world i  so

243
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,170
that I pass through china c with the outside

244
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,339
being more aware precisely of what

245
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:27,899
we do so a moment in which I

246
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,000
am at work for maybe rather than

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,680
just paying my soft I

248
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,699
think about it and say but my software how is it

249
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:37,889
the way in which I book how it

250
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:40,820
influences people is changing and from other

251
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:47,220
conscious decisions that in summary we are

252
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,160
talking about developing the

253
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,149
critical spirit

254
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:54,810
in the stand area so that

255
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,440
humanistic masses can be made

256
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,800
more likely to compete more often they are more usual  alfano

257
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,149
critical analysis of their work and

258
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,110
renan external companies

259
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,130
there is a certain so it was a certain

260
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,050
detachment in reality in the world of

261
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,820
those looking for political ethics anything else

262
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,170
and software developers we want to

263
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,089
reconnect these two worlds as

264
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,820
giving the word  to these these issues not

265
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,870
so much to the humanists and sending it

266
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,579
closer to these two worlds so

267
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:28,860
that there is more critical spirit not

268
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,519
software development

269
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,080
this is the gist  of why we

270
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,899
created shrimp how we are put at the

271
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,210
level of participation dimensions

272
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,570
we founded a few months ago three

273
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,430
months ago when we are about 600 700

274
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,200
users of which the rhine good

275
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,270
trentino forty active is not bad

276
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,899
in short, a team of six people we are

277
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,560
on  800 posts then 800 links sent

278
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,600
800 open discussions was found

279
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,130
with bots on tweets to be legs

280
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,529
soon on the mastodon better on

281
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:23,550
pleroma which is federated with the protocol

282
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,830
my account as it is called however also

283
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,930
through masto you cannot handle

284
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:35,190
automated trust and jokes on

285
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,779
Romanian shrimps when  back then if

286
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,970
you think that fire will blow up but

287
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,350
all on the point from the tip that

288
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:46,350
we have heard every single and small

289
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:51,120
parenthesis and we are also in fact

290
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,070
known on which platforms always

291
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,010
Italian that opens in these times of

292
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,140
example dealing with the online magazine

293
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,110
of  culture in general

294
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,540
not only with Trenitalia in general fifth

295
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,500
view by simone robutti for  founder is

296
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,320
a bit of an ideological guide

297
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,420
someone perhaps I know said

298
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,560
we too have been on think tech that a

299
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,160
podcast of technological novelty suite

300
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,380
feeds for science instead of the

301
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,660
situation line a site that deals with

302
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,570
scientific dissemination and so

303
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,000
anti-killing style so to speak  create a

304
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,040
platform an internist who explains in a

305
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,209
little more detail what

306
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:35,390
our vision of the

307
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,140
platform has done now and then on the collective which is

308
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,149
a collective among other things, the only

309
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,779
simple bit part that deals instead with the

310
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,920
relationship between technology and politics

311
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,209
so with a mission similar to

312
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:47,690
ours

313
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,840
only that instead of having a site as a

314
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,290
medium like this mission using a

315
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,450
collective as a facebook page you

316
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:06,590
could find real life and anything else if

317
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,730
you are interested in the address and cooper legs

318
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,470
you can also find the page requires an

319
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,380
invitation  simple question let's say to

320
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,490
avoid spam

321
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,860
only this accept the invitation of you I

322
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,900
am pinco pallino also with jer  maine

323
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,150
this mail of mine subscribe or if you

324
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,920
know someone who is already on shrimp

325
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,330
you can ask for an invitation directly to

326
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,430
him who was his who does a little pc

327
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,620
and said we are on tweet as an

328
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,870
automated field and also on a

329
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,420
mya channel finished here if you have  questions that

330
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,959
deteriorate

331
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:54,190
[Applause]
