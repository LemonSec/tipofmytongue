1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
then the argument concerns the

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,490
control code in the numbers codes that

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,519
identify a so-called object c

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,250
internal encounter namba the context is that

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,509
everything arises from the need to

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,270
identify an object within

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,890
a group of other objects

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,020
therefore the simplest way of garlic

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,760
number  progressive number and the

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,050
problem precisely that too

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,600
simple number notifies so the number does not

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,059
contain information about the object

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,750
but simply its an

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,440
association

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,410
then it was usually thought of

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,250
creating a composite code of various

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,950
foods

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,480
simpler examples precisely to the

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,120
identity card is not tax capable you all

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,500
know tax courses immagine

21
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,129
the other problem is that of

22
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,790
ensuring the integrity of the code

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,390
transmitted

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,930
because it is important to have a

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,700
certain identification of the object and

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,820
because it is important to have a guarantee

27
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,659
in the  integrity of the side transmitted

28
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,729
in the first case we have a few days

29
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:30,729
until a few days ago it was for a

30
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:34,619
c  aso of homonymy a patient has

31
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,990
obtained blood that is wrong

32
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,179
in case of transfusion and from the receipt

33
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:44,520
you can imagine the problem which you know

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,409
you have a certain identification of

35
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:51,580
what is being transmitted codegates

36
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,390
the integrity of the data

37
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,360
if in the transmission of a wave of

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,929
something else comes a corruption you

39
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:04,750
can have a

40
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,750
wrong identification such as the house plan or a

41
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:13,180
corruption in the case of zip it is easy

42
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,549
and very difficult to recover the data

43
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:17,980
contained in the zip archive

44
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,870
if by chance you are sure between the table of

45
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,269
contents

46
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:25,060
the problem  it is rather such because both

47
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:32,590
the topics that I do not know if you know are

48
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,590
zip containers with document data inside,

49
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,750


50
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,299
then there are those who end the backup inside the

51
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:44,079
clients who have the data recovered from

52
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,639
a backup is very important if

53
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,620
we believe it is an archive that  easily

54
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,430
corruptible due to some problem it

55
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,410
is a double problem so it would be good to

56
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,370
do a little thought due to particularities

57
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,470
of the data the problem can nas  from various

58
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,400
problems

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,340
in the transmission there may be the

60
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,640
line of interference on the vehicle on the

61
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,400
track r or there may be defects on the

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,950
half example a beat always at 1 a beat

63
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,280
seems 0 and the data arriving at san

64
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,450
totally wrong over time

65
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,900
various systems have been studied the

66
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,540
simpler bt parity on the

67
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,950
serial submission that is on the

68
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,590
so-called crc data blocks

69
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,409
or more on it succeeds on the

70
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:42,329
internal faults that you find the whole set let's

71
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,389
start with some examples the

72
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:50,319
fiscal code and cyprus first at European level

73
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,578
is called cf

74
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,349
in reality others  abbreviations because the second

75
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:01,209
of the country are all different occupies is

76
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,209
composed of the blind from groups of three

77
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:06,340
most expected characters with the surname

78
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,790
derive from the surname name from digits for

79
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,510
the year a cutter for the month of birth

80
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:19,000
day of birth 4 codes for the place

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,829
of birth and finally the

82
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,020
control character are on china broad right of

83
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,169
calculation of cin practically when

84
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,340
a football of stairs is transmitted from

85
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,380
point aa  At point b it is possible to trace

86
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,630
the fact that one of the most well-known

87
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,680
characters has been manipulated and

88
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,659
changed or by mistake entered

89
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:49,180
wrongly on the keyboard understand

90
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,389
there is a face lake rhythm because here it is a

91
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,409
winner apply it and a little salt and then

92
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,130
determine if what  received is

93
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,229
correct the receiver then it will be sung

94
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:04,539
month the sender can be someone who

95
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,580
inserts the data on

96
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:13,039
the face the simple question however

97
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,610
requires the conversion of various pieces

98
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,580
using multiplication tables that are not

99
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,889
immediately calculable are not

100
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:27,229
pressed the program of the so c '  it is

101
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:30,789
something called homophobia that is

102
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,220
two people can have completely

103
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,330
different but they give rise to the

104
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,159
same identical tax code and the case

105
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,830
of collision precisely taken what is

106
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,400
called collision then the who issues the

107
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,379
ministry who puts the facts of discharges

108
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:55,099
must correct by modifying one of the  of

109
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:57,020
characters and consequently also changes

110
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,440
the control karate also of ba  n

111
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,210
contains control operation the cin cin

112
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,830
euro with a few is the result of a

113
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,090
consists of two numerical digits the

114
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,810
calculation becomes light starting from

115
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,590
day one by

116
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:48,800
adding a string it0001063210

117
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,060
to go up if what it says use is

118
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,909
correct because it compares the cinco  side

119
00:06:55,909 --> 00:07:01,969
with the one who has received curiosity the

120
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:03,790


121
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,130
verification goes in this way last year the

122
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,770
first four this case the

123
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,760
recipient become 12 applies to the

124
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,530
smoke read and if it results module 97 from

125
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,290
one then the one that if received

126
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,680
correct not new to the side for chorister

127
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,990
the  cin derby also the bbm

128
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,670
format contents a

129
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,310
similarly more or less similar characteristic mark of

130
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,530
the fiscal code

131
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,560
the books contain a code which is called

132
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,150
internet international standard book

133
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,630
number 13 because there was a strange

134
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,790
precedent of consisting of 10 characters

135
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:51,210
by 13 indicates set music and yes  make up

136
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,340
this mariano sassi you can read the first

137
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:00,150
three digits are the code and then

138
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,260
this group itself is the grup  po

139
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,570
linguistic

140
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:08,280
then there is the group that of the physical

141
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,400
the publisher then a group that identifies

142
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,040
the single true title both the book the

143
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,910
magazine

144
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,120
finally there is the control code in

145
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,710
control code is calculated in a

146
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,350
fairly simple way because it ascona that the

147
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,960
figure  both of the cops years and

148
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,400
fell into position paredi disappeared

149
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,360
multiplied by one for you the sum

150
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,059
is a multiple of ten higher if it makes

151
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,659
the difference the single-digit number

152
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,789
should be compares with the

153
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,860
control chip so this is the formula that

154
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,230
should express not  they are sure that

155
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,860
it is consumed that it is correct however therefore

156
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,870
assuming the paris

157
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,670
or even numbers multiplied for three

158
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,870
various reasons

159
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,700
the registered letters the commanded bar code

160
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,440
also that is a code

161
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:13,670
check the first digits correct the

162
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:19,250
type of registered letter can be two

163
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,700
o three or four digits

164
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,700
indeed for 15 it indicates from the

165
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,760
simple command 6 50 a sent to the INPS

166
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,600
etc. it consists of eleven digits plus

167
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,110
the ci  n again we have the even

168
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,620
numbers of the odd digits separate multiply

169
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,140
by adding us to get them motivated by 15 7

170
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,470
beeswax to express the result and

171
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,500
it is treated as a single digit by adding the

172
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,700
between the fraud and making sure to 10 from the

173
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,850
five  where card that compared

174
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,120
with the broadcast cinema should be

175
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,240
late as there are other codes a

176
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,959
lot of you that contain the code

177
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,300
check the VAT number

178
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,030
there was or simply by operation

179
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,300
but also let's say the driving license is

180
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,460
composed of the modern one let's say it

181
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,820
consists of the prefix  1 a series of

182
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,110
numbers and the control code

183
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,710
bank investments what is always

184
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,030
the control codes

185
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,760
not especially in the cases of older codes

186
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,030
not in simple cases or those that

187
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,370
do not identify the precise object but a

188
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,060
category such as food in this case  the

189
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,990
c rope and socks food which is used

190
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,010
publication in from

191
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,580
Japanese publishing the first digit identifies the

192
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,330
type of the group of publications and the

193
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,450
second of the type and gl  the last two

194
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,420
identify another group and

195
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,140
subgroup in this case in comics of

196
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,010
a dramatic type

197
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,990
so all japanese comics have

198
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,090
moose 99 89

199
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,210
there is no control case maybe it

200
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,370
was one it seems to me that it is not so it

201
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,410
was created so that  is redundant

202
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,790
so if it is impossible to get the

203
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,550
combination launched from here it could be

204
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,190
traced to the fact that the segment was

205
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,930
wrong transmission was wrong

206
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:33,320
but I did not check well if there are

207
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:41,600
questions quickly your place well

208
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,370
thanks and greetings

209
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,450
