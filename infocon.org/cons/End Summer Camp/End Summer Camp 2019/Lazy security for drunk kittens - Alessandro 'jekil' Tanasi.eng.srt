1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
so my name is alessandro tanasi what

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,819
do i do unless our cards like on

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,490
google is quietly today i will

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,269
talk a little bit about how we

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,740
manage our security that

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,740
is it all started from a thought about what

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,859
i am i did that a little bit me to understand how

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,760
how  to manage my

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,699
data my privacy and my technologies for

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,019
example the computer and the telephone

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,790
everything starts from a thought that we are

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,040
all experts of nothing because

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,180
as our beautiful advertising explains to us

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,850
back I see that it does

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,840
truly fantastic marketing it is not the

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,219
our computer

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,289
we all have for various reasons who for

18
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,989
work or for personal reasons kg bar

19
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,699
connection dictionary of things we

20
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,660
want to keep well confined

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,729
inside the computer

22
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:07,320
we could also tell the secrets of the

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,680
information of things that

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,680
we do not want to be public anyway

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
who is who will be  a range of

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,350
bad bad bad bad stuff because this comes from the very

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:29,579
famous movie bad bad bad bad for

28
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,259
which we gest  we do things that

29
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,710
are discreet as we manage we record

30
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,320
with technology or with what we

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,689
could call a client device

32
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,530
there is a computer a phone because where

33
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,829
there is something else

34
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:52,259
since we could

35
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,509
somehow come from nameplate this  tool

36
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,649
could be compromised and you have to

37
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,000
make a little effort to

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,080
think that

39
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,440
if this tool is compromised

40
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,220
we basically take everything because you are

41
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,550
in the background it is not your computer

42
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,350
who breaks it becomes your

43
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,270
eyes because it sees what you see

44
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,820
the computer and  your hands because it is

45
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,030
capable of acting in your place with this

46
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,380
device for which you understand that the

47
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,370
security of a client system is very

48
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,170
important is a client I mean

49
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,290
any computer by making a cell phone and

50
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,990
if it is irreparably compromised

51
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,680


52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,020
we take value of

53
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,540
whatever we consider it  as safe because

54
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,410
maybe

55
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,900
we dedicate all our security to cryptography

56
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,760
using second  or of fourteen

57
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,209
preaching but if the bastion

58
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,110
of our clients falls all it is

59
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,010
useless that you have your data

60
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,410
encrypted on an external disk with the best

61
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,170
stature system in the world because

62
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,090
when attacking this disk to

63
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,459
your computer the data to decimate

64
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,060
why you will have to  to use them escort an ace

65
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,010
of your computer this data that can

66
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,500
use it so we go a

67
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,140
little bit broader concept but what we can

68
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,830
do to manage things in a safe way

69
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,170
which technology remains strong and

70
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,350
we have available to manage

71
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,790
our data or  our secrets

72
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,900
call them what you want they are beautiful first

73
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,890
step and face reality try to

74
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,370
understand that not a day like today when

75
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,489
the cyber threat is a high

76
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,050
enough level in the offensive technologies they

77
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,110
are usable by everyone they are

78
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,200
widespread in fact

79
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,959
we have to accept the world

80
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,410
we already live in  start thinking in

81
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,390
a perspective in which the applications we

82
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,330
use should be carried out in the

83
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,030
browser it  anti mail.it aintree slight

84
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,840
that before

85
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,510
he could not view my pdf

86
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,730
I know what happened not only for

87
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,108
computers and the network to begin to

88
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:23,850
understand that not only homes

89
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,620
can be heard but

90
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,260
can also behave in a

91
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,060
malicious way because maybe not  we establish an

92
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,260
application that we believe does with

93
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,360
a trojan horse

94
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,620
that must actually do it maybe

95
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,580
someone the subscribers server has put us

96
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,620
in a guerrino and we are going they

97
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,790
are quietly

98
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,990
waiting for the physical attacks I first

99
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,530
on another bathroom leave first five

100
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,030
years  my friend what will

101
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,070
this pc have done so much that the race will be

102
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,010
nothing but for now what is the

103
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,270
thing goes home and when we do not leave the

104
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,669
complicity in the hotel room for

105
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,139
example we use the encryption

106
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,840
this seems trivial invite you to think in

107
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,470
a perspective of  making our

108
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,280
milani systems safe because it is a ballet brick

109
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,530
building everything else is

110
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,630
boring  no like the bread of

111
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,570
systems that complain about safe

112
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,940
a problem that must be faced already in

113
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,340
the seventies by our academics is

114
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,950
that he told us how formally

115
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,190
a safe system must be made that if you

116
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,940
think about it it is common sense not to say

117
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,520
first of all a  secure system is a

118
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,160
system you need to be clear

119
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,830
because the more complexity you add the more

120
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,169
chances of having a and the skill

121
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:55,919
you have the more sought after coins there is a

122
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,130
default being 666 which means that

123
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,070
trivially things installed by default

124
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,260
with the windows diamond grain  they must

125
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,620
produce something sure not to

126
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,599
create default accounts reappeared

127
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:11,960
problems that arise

128
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,270
there must be a total mediation for

129
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,060
which there was the decoupling between

130
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,580
the inputs and the final system

131
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,659
the design is clearly must be

132
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:27,739
open you know very well that the

133
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:29,869
security nice scuriti is to re-enter

134
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,119
all the fields for which I do not know,

135
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:36,080
give it to you I must have applied a

136
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,149
big man in the times  inverter means

137
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:41,419
that things must be done onion like

138
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:45,159
a medieval castle if the

139
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:48,469
walls fail there are two other circles of

140
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:53,179
walls later I understood how an onion

141
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,649
applies the principle of the million

142
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,489
privilege but you know

143
00:06:57,489 --> 00:07:00,499
that I have to do an action not you  free

144
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:03,499
of privileges to the minimum to do it but

145
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:05,419
all this last point but in the

146
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:07,669
last first it is a given that is

147
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:10,159
recruiting that is, a system must be created

148
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:11,599
that the user can be able

149
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,869
to use for the user is not a great

150
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:17,899
their is  the required too much effort

151
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,069
not to feel safe

152
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:21,919
as you know we humans are lazy and it

153
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,869
will and it falls all right these are the

154
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:31,490
principles why you don't see them why

155
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,449
they have to be lowered again what is the

156
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:39,589
33 modeling for which I am going to lower

157
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:42,019
my confidence  why i need

158
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:46,579
security no one paranoid why i

159
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:49,579
watch porn at home because it is

160
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:51,860
fake illegal business

161
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,360
i dont want to be paid why

162
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,809
hide because based on what is the

163
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:02,749
motivation for pe  r which I have to manage

164
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,050
data based on that type of sides

165
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,249
I understand which is the

166
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:13,129
attacker's bar that I can clearly find

167
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:14,639


168
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,349
and if I look at the pony room my

169
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:20,300
attacker but what do I know looks at me in the pc

170
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,789
if only an arc trafficker or  other

171
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:24,270


172
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,249
problems my other big one at a higher

173
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:31,130
level attacker that arises towards us

174
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,309
tranches of attack vectors

175
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:38,760
that is we expose a surface for

176
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,490
example our computers expose a

177
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,339
surface that can be used

178
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,740
another large to arrive despite

179
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,250
this the case of an operating system

180
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,870
the attack reader are are typical

181
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,730
as mentioned before the applications can

182
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,279
be carried out the applications that

183
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,430
can be malicious applications

184
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,769
all that peripheral for which one

185
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:07,199
could get put in usb that does

186
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:10,560
things the town looks for thunderbolt cable

187
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,459
they are showing me the certain video

188
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,019
to network nanny so all matter

189
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,820
what about attacks they can prevent

190
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,440
via networks and  attacks that can

191
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,269
prevent in general from anything

192
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,550
that is an input such as a

193
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,029
file system file other

194
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:32,220
malicious applications that can interact the one

195
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,820
which my same other firmware

196
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,100
architet the index of all that

197
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,070
software vectors to attack but

198
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,279
also these  like the 3 the model they have

199
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,350
different levels

200
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,110
that is based on the fashion my tower with

201
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,160
which I interact who is

202
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,370
and how much money does he want to spend because

203
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,709
based on how much money he wants to spend he can

204
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:59,060
have access to technologies be slides

205
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,640
or not for example that only to

206
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,499
buy 10

207
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:07,739
I having to bring out and in the various kinds of

208
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:12,269
money while they show badly will never do

209
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:13,159
it

210
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,359
clearly starting instead is to

211
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:21,109
divide these technologies of vectors

212
00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:22,799
by category

213
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,659
we begin to see everything that is

214
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:27,239
inside the playstation software of the

215
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:29,489
software it happens parliament or only

216
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:31,019
indications I can services that

217
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,109
we set up services and remote so

218
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:35,729
we run a service such

219
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:38,219
as a we server  b is that the background on

220
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:39,629
applications

221
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:43,529
we open the famous pdf before

222
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:48,479
the return of the pdf is exported you understand that

223
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,819
this second case

224
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:53,009
requires islam interaction I must be the

225
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:56,789
user open the link click on

00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:08,669
a female rule on the tax scene and

230
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,939
when part of the things I use

231
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:14,009
below are compromised for

232
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,289
example it is so fashionable docker

233
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:17,909
we all use the container of ocher but no one goes

234
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:22,859
to look inside this can lead  to

235
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:25,049
a compromise of our system and

236
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:26,369
with the typical

237
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:27,989
technicians the Brescia technician while

238
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:31,169
shaun testing also goes over the escalation

239
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:35,039
to obtain privileges to look

240
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,519
around

241
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,339
a credential system and re-enter

242
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,139
laser data take away what we

243
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:42,509
need so in a systematic

244
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:45,049
since it happens in the

245
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:47,220
initial relation of a system of

246
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,379
a basic application they have

247
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:51,839
access all

248
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,039
example t  ipico that many of you will

249
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,399
know these beef is hardly seen but it

250
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,299
is a tool of atac oakland 6 remained

251
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:01,369
in a web page

252
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:05,189
this js allows a

253
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:07,759
remote console to do things the

254
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,870
type page with scanning of the atalanta

255
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,640
an enumeration of things it seems  basic then

256
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,500
what the user is simply

257
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,880
going to a site toshack oseary nothing

258
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,500
rather than a note typical consumption

259
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,050
through while floyd and it will break through

260
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,470
service you get the same local and

261
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,640
take a picture of the practice in my opinion you do not

262
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,550
even know more advanced

263
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,510
from catalog also historical tone snowden

264
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,290
a rootkit of the wef in which the

265
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,000
presence in via wi fi is claimed this thing

266
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,880
as well as ok is that intimate they

267
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,170
implemented such a thing in galileo in

268
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,500


269
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,320
addition to this we have to worry

270
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,020
about physical attacks you never wonder what

271
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,370
can change  your computer

272
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,730
when I left it alone if someone dismounts you in

273
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,770
the evening the keyboard put

274
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:09,170
a keylogger in it end things remain a

275
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,660
new f  irmware recruited you will notice it

276
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,360
be no says nobody would

277
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,370
notice they are or even if

278
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,650
someone made a fair position

279
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,920
forest of your systems there was

280
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,360
network themes and all encrypted our

281
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,620
problem

282
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,640
yes sure I tell you but now it is

283
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,200
encrypted in ten years they want

284
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,350
only what it will be like I don't know if you

285
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,460
remember years ago there was a

286
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,730
ssh ability in which part of the keys was

287
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,090
predictable some buildings it means that

288
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,440
if I had an impact of the traffic

289
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,150
on sciacca in the drawer line adaptation

290
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,980
for an years a  some point comes out

291
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,790
the vulnerability found

292
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,020
participate so do not assume that the

293
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,710
current encryption always as a method of

294
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,980
defense

295
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,440
practical example

296
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,300
you know that many times like the

297
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,010
one I paid now with the video the

298
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,750
thunderbird allow access to

299
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,960
raitre memory many dna  of fate or if you

300
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,730
can give

301
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,730
I would like to do a lot of nice things in the

302
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,970
40s there was a very nice air to do

303
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,110
this type of thing that in fact they a  nno

304
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,490


305
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,920
networks were not designed to access networks yesterday, networks not

306
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,940
connected to normal ethernet wi move

307
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,070
that we understood what our

308
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,990
problems are what we can do well

309
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,720
to think about it in the meantime I would say

310
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,560
let's start thinking about it we understand who we are

311
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,120
what is our 33 model

312
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,940
what are they  our use cases know how

313
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,110
we work what we have to do

314
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,680
computer is in particular when you want to

315
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,389
invest that is I cannot buy

316
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:02,260
computer events each one but a different thing

317
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,510
based on this I put on the scale what

318
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,199
are the common cases of attack for me

319
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,269
could it be that I  receives the email

320
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,339
with the malware what happens to everyone as

321
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,449
I put on the scale what

322
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,130
could be world skies trip hop

323
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:23,709
I lose the iphone is all this we

324
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:26,110
make a plan of how to act not only

325
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,720
technological but also at a

326
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,639
procedural level example everyone tells you that

327
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,160
the  passwords must be complex and

328
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,050
kept in very serious gearing

329
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,760
the password of the cloud or of the

330
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,260
google song takes a  a nice ball on the

331
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,180
random of 32 characters those observed

332
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,199
in our fantastic wallet at a certain

333
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,819
point they steal your phone

334
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,170
you want 7 there that you have to use look

335
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,459
for me on the phone to understand where to stay on the

336
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:59,709
phone but your word the 32

337
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,260
long random character is at home in the

338
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,680
our wallet in your pc you

339
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,350
thought you were safe but you have not

340
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,829
put all the cases for which

341
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:13,540
security must also be presented but I think of

342
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,880
everything that could happen to us

343
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,860
we risk being very safe and but

344
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,029
even if outside in some cases a

345
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:23,540
very nice thing  which is

346
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,970
that an example made by giovanna rotunno scales

347
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,170
the author of chivu to understand

348
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,360
who is her hughes who is by dividing it

349
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,050
into herself surgical well that is to make a

350
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,810
mental map of what, for

351
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,759
example, work the interactions that are

352
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,779
the coveted work with  the personal sphere

353
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,910
etc. etc. and from this mind bap to

354
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,000
assign colors based on a

355
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,350
mile based on the confidentiality of the

356
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,290
domain the world to understand which ones I know  no the

357
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,380
clusters to isolate and how to isolate them at

358
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,600
a technological level

359
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,660
done this you pass the presentation

360
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,500
the implementation first thing it says

361
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,199
I have to start trusting something

362
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,679
I can not trust everything giving has

363
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:15,829
compromised everything because it does not come out

364
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,990
for example the cpi  it must be entrusted

365
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,449
if needed they put a back of the

366
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:24,079
cpu passion but they can not put me

367
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,120
to make you karl clearly so we

368
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,650
understand what end to trust this is called

369
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,309
tcb the set of all those

370
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:38,450
entities we must trust limit it

371
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,659
to a minimum  and we hope that

372
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:48,370
we propose it with attention

373
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,870
and we are careful as we hope it

374
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,400
in the sense that I decide that I want

375
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,790
computer xy I go to buy myself

376
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,120
then the risk that is what I go to

377
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,860
buy without having picked up from the

378
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,540
box now I do not say it is  how

379
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,950
did

380
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,679
the delivery of the amazon parcel be

381
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,169
diverted stop for a day so

382
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:14,179
d'este dell'arco brad pitt and then

383
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:16,429
sent back to you because i don't think

384
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,970
you are this kind of scenario but if

385
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,770
you buy the used stuff on the beautiful who

386
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,919
assures

387
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,419
you that something healthy arrives to you in fact

388
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:28,529
the problem of the

389
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:31,559
hardware professions and the first point to

390
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,820
face we have to buy

391
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,720
the hardware in a safe place between

392
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,450
quotes if it is not online we are

393
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,509
calmer because 11 randomly I

394
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:46,679
hope there may be some on play

395
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,019
cena tax it happened in history that if it

396
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:51,779
was typical they were already mugged

397
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:54,330
with soft in cold you polaris it seems to me it

398
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,259
was recently waging war is a lot

399
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:00,659
anyway you have everything that the paranoid

400
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:03,690
also say that you should open your pc and

401
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,119
do it knows that hardware but

402
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,340
this is the basis it is quite complicated to

403
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,899
do you have to make the schematics

404
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,869
too complicated before and the paranoid to

405
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:15,210
know why you should reflect

406
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,149
bios that in any case we do not know what  'it is with

407
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:20,399
with derby of the beyonce open source build

408
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:22,429
that it was that this is a heart

409
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,480
surgery difficulty level operation in

410
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,749
short

411
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,389
let's remember that for a few years trust

412
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:33,330
boot that allows us to

413
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,950
start basic digitally signed

414
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,100
software so we are more relaxed in

415
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,259
what we start because the

416
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,549
firmware validates through

417
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:46,340
certificates that you are in the belly

418
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,359
the integrity of the software makes you

419
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,200
leave and then we go install the

420
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,519
operating system operating system

421
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,100
should be safe and here they bring us

422
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,389
the various philosophies philosophy one takes

423
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:06,299
a normal operating system windows

424
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:09,869
linux mac pro [ __ ] march I apply

425
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:12,019
in the hardware configuration

426
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:15,379
according to standard cis my feeling

427
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:20,720
what you want basic euro this by

428
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,559
adding us  maybe a minimum of

429
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,019
separation for the environments was the

430
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:26,309
mind will go to auction it's like I don't know

431
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,869
when I have to open a link that

432
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:29,900
my friend sent me via skype they

433
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,850
open they open the web and I launch it inside

434
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,250
there is some project like kicks record

435
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,250
which is an art as it comes to the end which will

436
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,620
implement these things this

437
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,140
level 1 of the inning art  but also the

438
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,910
one that puts you more usability because in

439
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,030
any case a mainstream system with

440
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:54,130
hardware support usability and centers the

441
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,100
next step there are those who say that it is okay to

442
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,470
use a privacy bone that is these

443
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,740
systems designed for privacy such as

444
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,330
tales the onyx precisely that these are

445
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,470
basic systems designed to be

446
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,550
used anonymously from the network point of

447
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,370
view not to be resident in

448
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,650
attacks so you do not see a

449
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,210
bit like things a letter in which

450
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,070
as taiz you make your key must be started

451
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,760


452
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,560
do your things at the putative all

453
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,850
while interesting  from the voice of won

454
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,110
hicks who always has the same concept

455
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:35,000
but uses two web split to be

456
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,320
sure of the traffic limitation

457
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,360
so one is a client and the other a

458
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,930
thor router to be sure

459
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,520
to enforce all the traffic and not

460
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,780
of numbers that there are those who say that it is okay to

461
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,280
use a system like cai but they are

462
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,110
systems made for other purposes they are parts

463
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,240
for offensive purposes for well testers are

464
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,010
more basic than the collections of touris for

465
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,420
those who do not want to do the extraction

466
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,920
of tools of resilient latakia are

467
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,550
really little if it were not for the calista

468
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:10,630
that the look of the lux prom

469
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,150
entry key that then there are the systems are

470
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,880
designed by  start for safety or

471
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,520
rewarded the historical system that has

472
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,040
released a lot of

473
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,480
community contributions done with safety in

474
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,090
mind from the beginning sd partner came

475
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,470
later is a fork of ps of with the mindset

476
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,050
of creating a safe system

477
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,610
obviously these  they are

478
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,770
niche systems for which to turn around are

479
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,780
blasphemies

480
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,160
but in my opinion at least two people

481
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,670
who like the cloth there are but it

482
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,640
is not much a thing of everyone's reach

483
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,940


484
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,620
thing that is fashionable cube source which

485
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,320
in my opinion is the system  modern more

486
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,880
adequate in the sense that it is a project that

487
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,770
bases its basic security and

488
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,210
on the rare isolation done via csen

489
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,260
of the domains of your data for which

490
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,180
your domain is the working one

491
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,450
q  uello staff will run on two

492
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,120
different vm csen that do not talk to each other basically as

493
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,680
well as being competitions all

494
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,770
that inhabit it between streets on

495
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,120
particular ones such as the part this view

496
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,300
the part of the network on the web and then had

497
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,850
deliberately created by the user

498
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,600
of the  'interconnection how this is used

499
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,640
at a functional level very very nice

500
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,800
the problem that even here

501
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,810
hardware support very little community

502
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,270
small blasphemies the whole calendar

503
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,030
of saints to make it go big

504
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,060
performance overhead because it consumes

505
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,010
a lot of battery being based on a

506
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:01,240
sacred on virtualization so  in

507
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,460
a real case because it would waste a

508
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,440
month just to setup this stuff there

509
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,530
then it is the same concept of cure but

510
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,430
based on the fourth net and not using xen

511
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,070
but using primitives to contain

512
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,710
the action of carmen

513
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,970
however this is also another French

514
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,780
sponsored by agents and sure rome

515
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,340
who sees the french formations so

516
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,580
you see a bit then but these two are

517
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,810
in my opinion the state

518
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,820
of the art of what and the usability

519
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,480
of security systems are women

520
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,410
so how

521
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,980
one has to choose between these two

522
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,200
or a custom one in which you take a

523
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,900
mainstream system is the trend of

524
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,790
people  in my opinion in the end probability

525
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:55,770
against last step everything

526
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,960
we produce where we put it we

527
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,630


528
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,890
ask only we put it in something that acts as a safe for the files

529
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,000
of the good alternatives in my opinion there are

530
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,760
two one is a writer an Italian

531
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,880
xhixha basic mark is only  software

532
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,860
or destinations where you want

533
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,810
a nice idea metra spa rivero

534
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,690
piccolino that takes it everywhere and

535
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,880
actually creates a volt of data

536
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,230
usable through a browser in which all the

537
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,410
encryption is browser while the

538
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,690
second interlock is nothing more than an

539
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,300
application for harmony gas  the

540
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,010
fantastic usb stick you see

541
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,930
above programmable that can do a

542
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,560
lot of things that allows it to

543
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,510
act as if it were fans make a

544
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,360
case m in which t  enere your files ea

545
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,690
with lots of other things for which by

546
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,900
concluding you parties made your

547
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,310
idea you have understood a little that cares about how to

548
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,740
manage security

549
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,470
probably derived has an idea like and

550
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,170
carmatic west in which you have messed

551
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:08,990
up life in the cube but  you have learned that

552
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,750
first of all there are no

553
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,470
general solutions to the problem

554
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,240
computer security unfortunately over

555
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,420
time the name is well-liked with the

556
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,820
demographics certain types of people

557
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,900
they use and with threats

558
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,920
something is going very well now

559
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,370
that security in the mobile environment  has

560
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,020
made the big step forward

561
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,620
objectively pierce a latest

562
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,010
model iphone with the latest film quite

563
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,680
complicated and expensive and if you want that figure should not be

564
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,330
read and I could rest

565
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,389
assured

566
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,230
that in the end it is you who must

567
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,330
decide which is the adequate security

568
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,350
for this  they are mapping your

569
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,320
domain sites and thinking about your

570
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,760
use cases and coming out wrong with a solution other

571
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,320
than that of f  oto of before but it is

572
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,750
a solution that has a good security

573
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,480
with a small impact on your life

574
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,740
that is you must be able to

575
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,620
use the computer do everything

576
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,030
you do during the day and this

577
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,490
work in a quiet way without going

578
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,169
crazy to copy a file you will have

579
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:26,809
learned that where you have to lose

580
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:30,320
checklists in an emergency the

581
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,620
typical example you lose your mobile phone from before was

582
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,929
even if you steal from a laptop

583
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:40,610
where you have your role in the accounts

584
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,940
of the passwords you do in may backup

585
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,410
your own capabilities the other with  a

586
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:50,390
password option and in the end you understand

587
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,640
how much technology you have to use a good

588
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,220
idea is usually to divide the pid men

589
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,690
unless the most important ones on

590
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,210
the different hardware than the work pc that

591
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,850
can there the technology for you

592
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:09,500
well there is something but I do not  I feel I can

593
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,080
suggest a solution nor

594
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,940
do I find my solution I have a

595
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,740
debian pc with a

596
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,840
particular configuration that I use as normal friends or

597
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,710
11 closes last for  other is so basic

598
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,660
I am quite confident but

599
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,750
this works for others it depends

600
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:34,160
however basic remember that you have to

601
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,900
minimize hardware access

602
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,910
I think from the moment someone looks like

603
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,100
your pc you are finished and there is

604
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,400
nothing to do

605
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,540
implemented with a storage bucket to

606
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,940
keep  your things always use

607
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,390
a second authentication factor and

608
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,370
all this would be useless if you want

609
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,280
to break the rules at some point that is

610
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,530
if you want the work pc one day you

611
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,770
use to open a personal email

612
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,270
you break the rule and you do not know that

613
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:06,520
the kiss falls  it ran out of time it was short

614
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,050
if you have questions or 3 pure

615
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:22,420
[Applause]

616
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:38,179
from the range it was 7 castro names which is a

617
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:44,570
famous movie with robert redford who is

618
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:51,039
called scam lord good

619
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,150
ready you wonder it seems little was

620
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,929
what you think of the change from the point

621
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,700
banking view of using apps

622
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,559
rather credit then

623
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,970
well then this is a very long

624
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:18,380
basic history of course i realize

625
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,440
that i  The introduction of the PSP2 that create the

626
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,230
legislation that has in fact obliged

627
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:28,130
European banks to use a

628
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:34,010
factor of two between strong is a big

629
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,070
step forward in the sense that

630
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,610
perhaps it will be the systemic big bank

631
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,650
that has a certain level of security

632
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,500
there.  'he had and the other maybe he used from

633
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,450
matrix cardelmar redemption times

634
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,210
tables that give you some coupons

635
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,070
like credit cards surprises where

636
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,400
they

637
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,230
tell you tell me the number that is written in

638
00:30:54,230 --> 00:31:00,470
column 4 row is correct but there are

639
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,440
many who still used them  unfortunately

640
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,720
it is not the problem is not to use it to

641
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,780
use it badly in the sense that there are people

642
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,610
that if they photocopies and turn them around

643
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,090
there are people who believe that if all the

644
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,250
phones and you say that you are from the bank, the

645
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,780
cherry trees number me  he tells you but the user

646
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,549
always the first way to fail you cannot

647
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:28,549
trust rely on the user

648
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:31,370
you have to create a safe system even

649
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,700
for the user who fails

650
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,620
I think it is a very good thing

651
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,080
because they finally have stable  from the

652
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,360
book of the minimum bar

653
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,629
for access

654
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:56,759
I have done that it typically presents you

655
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:59,009
with an app on the

656
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:02,039
mobile phone that to 8 million billion

657
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:08,179
things on board applications on board

658
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:11,909
however the surface the attack certainly

659
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:15,690
increases yes  it increases but still smaller

660
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,789
in the sense that the attack surface

661
00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:19,559
that that there is any app

662
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:22,799
inside a phone is still

663
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,259
less than any factor that I

664
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:29,220
can give you the static matrix card of

665
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,379
something that I can send you a static

666
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:32,600
sms

667
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,259
ok anyway it is better than a

668
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:38,879
physical token than key rings with

669
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:43,230
numbers because because an app is

670
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,539
conscious in the sense that I am the

671
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:48,450
supplier of the app to decide what is the

672
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,200
security level of that flash,

673
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,610
that bar here I could also

674
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,259
decide that on a  device not updated

675
00:32:55,259 --> 00:33:01,320
a ride if he decides it is because I take

676
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,149
risk because I do my

677
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:06,330
reasoning I see that there is no one attacks me I

678
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:10,320
see that android 4 there were 3

679
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,619
percent in my customers pe  r which why not,

680
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:14,909
however, they are

681
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,999
technically risk-taking updates you who deliver

682
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:20,309
an app have a very high level of security

683
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:27,330
and in particular with

684
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,990
modern phones attacks in rep

685
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,779
there is an app that attacks another it is not

686
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:34,289
easy

687
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:37,019
that is I want  see it on a last ios

688
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,019
like you from a thousand egypt app that

689
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,159
measures data from the other

690
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,560
if you are doing it to the 10 gods that you do not use it

691
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,330
for tokens but someone sells it to you a

692
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,439
few million dollars

693
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,359
hello look at the mobile and android and there

694
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,750
are some  options to date several years

695
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:18,389
ad in the programs in ardini versions of

696
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,060
android at what point are they

697
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:26,029
are usable then with graphite os

698
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,918
android is the app the much more

699
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:31,409
fragmentary question obviously in the sense that

700
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,730
you have the vendors that give you and

701
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:39,929
black box products that tell you  be sure

702
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:42,030
basically they are custom androids which is

703
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:45,000
that they create using perhaps

704
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,639
their own infrastructure and sell you a

705
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,239
phone bundle with them andrea stone

706
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,239
closed for a few thousand euros

707
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,330
example cr  yptophone we have

708
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:02,310
open typography projects that implement

709
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,490
security office on android

710
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,050
obviously the above are

711
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,970
niche products to be beautiful on

712
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,640
paper the features are there are office

713
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:20,280
useful pro to go jumbe job no

714
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,440
depends on which all the fashions  and

715
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,990
that is who can be interested in a

716
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,070
phone that if you are a trafficker

717
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,830
maybe yes if you can't tell but you know that

718
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,400
in the end there is an updated operating system

719
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,380
on having reasoned maybe for

720
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,240
me it is quite safe

721
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,020
I honestly as with my iphone

722
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:49,920
updated properly  then hear the

723
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,570
beautiful projects of weight there are many projects

724
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,400
these things but also as the

725
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,410
operating systems that I have shown and the

726
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,430
difficulty of access

727
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:00,660
first point and usability because for

728
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,609
example in jobs to say I give an

729
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:05,839
example if you want to copy

730
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,020
a text from  a job mail to your

731
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,279
personal editor

732
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:13,519
is not that you do the count of the cd against

733
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,929
you have to press four times four

734
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:20,369
different combinations  not really friend of

735
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:21,900
usability for someone who has to work

736
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,239
at full throttle all day same thing

737
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:26,959
for phones

738
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,830
thanks

739
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:42,920
[Applause]
