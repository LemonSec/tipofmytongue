1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,149
I wanted to make a presentation

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:04,890
in the usual way come to

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,710
present my research projects

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,179
come present my things on

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,889
virtual network machines

6
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,820
instead today I want to take you to see

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,830
what are the tools I

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,990
use daily in my lessons I

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,060
bring them to  inside the lesson of the

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,130
operating systems of the university of

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,880
bologna and let's start from this toy

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,179
here

13
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,930
this toy had made it

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,350
in the context of rusty boa to play with

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,910


16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,750
pixels I brought it together I took it to the

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,120
maker faire loved it attracts

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,950
so much attention and among other things I

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,170
don't know if you noticed it was written if you

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,199
connect to peace play with your

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,250
mobile phone using telegram you can

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,680
send messages in real time or

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,799
write any text will appear here as

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,710
soon as you see that  many

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,799
are playing when I saw this

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,049
thing and I said well if there are any things of

27
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,820
interest let's

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,130
bring it to the classroom because that's

29
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,350
what a do is  cente has to do is try to

30
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,689
attract the interest of the students

31
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:29,640
then I took him in a course project

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,520
of virtual systems a

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,710
complementary course where o I start from the years

34
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,869
10 18 students and what happened

35
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:42,299
what is happening now that everyone was

36
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,680
thinking about display  and they no longer thought

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,189
about let's say the lesson to the activity

38
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:54,810
for which it attracted a lot then I said

39
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,600
but we must not throw it away and the idea

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,760
the problem is that

41
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,990
for some psychological reason the LEDs

42
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:08,190
so flashing all the things that

43
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,750
move maybe it will be ours

44
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,320
animal instinct make sure that it gets

45
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
our attention too much

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,230
and then what did it do

47
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,360
I inserted a bot but done it in a different way

48
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,370


49
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,310
within the classroom equipment

50
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,880
what you see here is not

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,160
the image shown but an image of

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,810
a  virtual machine that is

53
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,740
working in bologna and this is a

54
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,540
tool that they have been

55
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:48,020
in the course for many years as I use it I have

56
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,190
discovered that I hate the lights of those stories

57
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,230
more  splash because because one of the

58
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,120
problems I have is that students

59
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,610
are normally passive they would like to land

60
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,530
knowledge or not they

61
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,620
are there getting back is good and now and

62
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,840
very often transparencies make

63
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,510
the student think that that is the

64
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,850
subject to study would be like trying

65
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,930
to understand the work by looking at

66
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,890
the beginning of the booklet the characters and interpreters

67
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,010
that is usually only in transparency it is only

68
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,250
a presentation of the boss s therefore

69
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,280
normally I do orem lesson in the

70
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,290
classroom as they did just once

71
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,510
with the pizzino with the sheet of

72
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,090
topics to play or I put it on

73
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,019
a shared editor and the notes

74
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,700
are generated

75
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,250
and here it is this is found on the top

76
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,230
of the municipality a machine you want to connect

77
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,140
as you wrote on the display

78
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,360
you can connect is upset and change

79
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,100
with me the notes that are on the

80
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,410
screen is of  usually while I speak

81
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,740
the notes

82
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,200
the students continue to take

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,930
notes and they see it both on the display and

84
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,590
on the browser man

85
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,180
the other c  dare that there is that some time ago but

86
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,370
let's also stream audio but

87
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,370
actually I believe in the frontal lesson

88
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,470
here is this site you can find it with a

89
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,370
browser look for renzo davoli live that

90
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,690
makes sure that all the screen I have here

91
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,120
here now it does the camera effect one

92
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,200
inside the other but you can have the large

93
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,740
copies of the screen on the mobile phone

94
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,500
on the laptop

95
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,350
this is useful yes because it is in the last

96
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,120
rows it is difficult to take the blackboard but it

97
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,670
is very useful also because if there is

98
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,080
we have built together a program

99
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,910
that interests you and one wants to take it

100
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,800
to study it later

101
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,830
just take the snap shot of the image and

102
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,500
keep it in the clipboard so there is this

103
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,230
tool that other or all

104
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,370
in the bottom right corner or mot

105
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,550
this time  if you want to call if

106
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:35,200
you want to try them you can connect ar

107
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,130
of 235 bots

108
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,420
and what is what you write

109
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,240
will appear there when I said it around

110
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,020
colleagues friends told me but what are

111
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,630
you doing very dangerous because it knows what

112
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,380
I am writing to you  no on that on that blackboard

113
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,110
it is not true it is not true because

114
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,640
beyond someone who has a

115
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,640
level of maturity and does these things

116
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:16,150
once it is clear that we are not in

117
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,370
elementary school a dirty word a shot from

118
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,050
bristles no one

119
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,300
at that point the situation  stable yes and

120
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,120
the students understand and participate in

121
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,630
this new method of teaching

122
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:34,380
what changes having this compared to

123
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,650
the normal interaction changes that the one

124
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,120
is anonymous

125
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,400
the student is afraid to raise his hand to

126
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,680
say I don't understand instead he can write

127
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,570
it is not clear  because he has done this what

128
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:57,700
happens he is afraid of both the judgment of the

129
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,590
teacher but also of the judgment of

130
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,420
his colleagues there can also be

131
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,500
jokes if you can also have the tone and

132
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,290
then asynchronous because there is always the fear

133
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,440
of interrupting the flow of speech

134
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,740
during the  lesson while instead

135
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,260
the questions accumulate and phillies that the

136
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,830
speech I turn around I see the questions that

137
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,860
have emerged in the meantime and you can

138
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,360
answer by doing what you get

139
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,650
Another benefit is the cell phone enemy

140
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,230
of the lesson because it is used to do

141
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,660
other activities it becomes a tool for

142
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,500
action there was a saying that said

143
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,530
rather than fight it allies and

144
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,510
better ally with these tools is to

145
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,400
make sure that they become tools to be

146
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,550


147
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,380
used.  so the lesson

148
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,700
by doing so becomes a story a

149
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:04,180
shared construction and it is possible to

150
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,150
follow the flow of the

151
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,890
needs of the students' requests not only

152
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,960
but you make me appear someone will take

153
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,530
the 235 era of 235 bots and write me

154
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,750
something

155
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,720
one says is small if you want it

156
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,090
we have projectors as big as something

157
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,970
perfect except for another

158
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,440
factor a student has to participate

159
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,630
in the lesson it is the best thing is that

160
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,320
they do exercises how to

161
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,580
mentally say exercises on

162
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,150
their own preparation which I know

163
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,970
creates challenges to say but this thing that

164
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,480
we have explained then  this thing is

165
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,070
so and so who votes what they

166
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,260
could  do as public voting by

167
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,090
saying raise your hand who starts that

168
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,560
this thing implemented at

169
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,680
kernel level others your hand too there

170
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,800
would be the fear of saying enough here I

171
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,030
got the answer

172
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,350
normally what happens excel

173
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:23,270
as the scholar and front row nerd say

174
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,060
to  home the hand all the others

175
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,110
are good and quiet for fear well

176
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,010
integrated inside the vote

177
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,520
there is also a rotation device if

178
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,670
now you know

179
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:51,820
we find it to do a test

180
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,890
you have to do a bot bar is empty then

181
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,800
half answer bot bar  yes the other

182
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,190
half bar got no

183
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,140
ok if by chance you made a mistake and you want

184
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,290
to vote again if you do another bar vote yes

185
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,510
how to get them give they do not keep track

186
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,310
of ideas but I need you to make

187
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,870
sure that if one cannot notice

188
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,480
twice if one  once twice the second

189
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,430
time cancel your first vote you

190
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,160
change your mind

191
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,190
ok at some point someone

192
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,560
rude me slash qaunto 1 or usually

193
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,760
I do it by doing next to those

194
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,300
results i cont  ii results yes two yes

195
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,550
one it is seen that a written one allows

196
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,830
a hundred assistance if it were a

197
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,940
different house or house

198
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,220
at that point this serves to increase

199
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,830
the discussion and in the meantime see to

200
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,590
self-evaluate to see if the concept is

201
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,360
past or there are

202
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,150
misunderstandings so you see that

203
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:03,010
such a trivial tool i'm 50 60 line of

204
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,030
python code ago has

205
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:12,660
really a lot effects like saying useful

206
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,820
inside a lesson because i

207
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,890
came to mind these votes

208
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,730
because one day i went to a

209
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,530
rector's meeting at my

210
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,900
university and with great fanfare  they

211
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,850
announced that in the stand of the in

212
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,310
a historic classroom of the university he

213
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,790
set up a so-called system of

214
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,340
feelings analysis were given to

215
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,160
all present by the remote controls with

216
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,080
keys numbered from 1 to 10

217
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,570
a slide was projected on which there was

218
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,160
written, for example, questions like

219
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,769
does he know what the most important concept is

220
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:54,730
that why you feel important

221
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,379
in the university didactics research it  a

222
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:58,389
third issue is one will have to push the

223
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:01,869
button as a teleshopping

224
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:03,759
and this thing costs tens of

225
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,189
thousands of euros and costs a lot of

226
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:08,649
maintenance because there are batteries

227
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:11,410
break the remote controls this thing

228
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,999
able to do the same at no cost

229
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:19,569
because  it is in fact use

230
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:24,269
of telegraph infrastructures and / or a python program

231
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:28,299
so when the new course starts from tomorrow

232
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:32,529
I hope it goes well as

233
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:35,439
last year every year is a

234
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:38,290
new and a new path every every

235
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,549
class of the student

236
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:42,369
I am afraid in the first lesson  of each

237
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:43,829


238
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,139
academic year last year this way of working

239
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:49,480
also in the evaluation of the

240
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,999
teaching activity was very positive it was

241
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:54,759
very positive it was taken very

242
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:57,790
positively by the students

243
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:03,970
maybe one ok obviously

244
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:11,990
the bot code is [ __ ] but it is

245
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:19,519
available on mine  black inside

246
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,679
toads and bon I published it yesterday the

247
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,389
rest of the structure I'd like to

248
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,339
publish it is just a problem of time

249
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:32,660
this too me  ccanism for this

250
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,689
mechanism to broadcast the

251
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,429
video is not that all of you if you

252
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:41,209
connect to see this this the

253
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:44,509
live page connect here because if

254
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:46,189
I should have a lot of bandwidth to my

255
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:49,339
laptop there is a reflector in the university

256
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,220
that takes the unc stream and  send it to

257
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,920
everyone who is tuned in there

258
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,509
would also be a chance to

259
00:13:56,509 --> 00:14:00,199
allow some student to get

260
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,600
into writing so use so I can

261
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,129
say at some point you keep

262
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:06,829
doing this program and we discuss it

263
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:10,999
together and in the end I don't know if you have

264
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:14,689
tried it  the mechanism to watch the

265
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:17,509
vnc flow is a wine client there is written

266
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:21,230
in javascript blind side and therefore in addition

267
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,249
to reflector a converter to web socket

268
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:28,160
to be able to send the flow but already the

269
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,819
state works very well even a

270
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:34,279
class of 150 I do not think that all  they

271
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:37,370
are connected but 40 50 lessons are

272
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,829
connected etc. to that bit of delay

273
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:42,790
if you have seen it you notice however it is

274
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,829
enough to have a good

275
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:48,829
continuity of active

276
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:50,509
so he brought you we wanted to

277
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:54,470
bring you into a

278
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,420
work environment of my course I hope you

279
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,379
liked it if someone wanted to reply

280
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:02,600
would like to have

281
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,040
some ideas as code wants to send me

282
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,209
further

283
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,060
ideas my address is published more or less

284
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,430
however however renza cs not  you want some

285
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,639
and I will be happy to continue

286
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,790
this experience with you I spoke

287
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,949
so quickly that no I went

288
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:27,819
over 10 minutes

289
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,300
ok you have questions where requested and you want

290
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,019
to try out

291
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,550
thanks

292
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:47,920
[Applause]
