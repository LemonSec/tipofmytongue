1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
so good morning everyone we will

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,220
briefly talk about oti security or

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,160
safety in industrial plants

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,679
security of industrial plants

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,000
basically you know that now it is

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,400
so fashionable among the basics of recent

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,850
years famous industry 4.0

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,250
so if you are dealing with because you

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,830
work in a company

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,039
that does  metalworking or

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,050
manufacturing etc.

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,230
or if you work as consultants with

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,969
these companies and in this or this

14
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,610
environment in this area let

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,440
's say Italy as in others it is full of this

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,570
type of companies or if you work as

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,710
IT security

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,410
consultants etc.  can give you

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,350
some interesting ideas

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,789
this is obviously an

21
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,010
introductory talk so then you will have to

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,360
put your effort into deepening a little very

23
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,590
quickly for those who do not know

24
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,410
I deal with security analysis in

25
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,510
particular with penetration tests which

26
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,979
in Italian sounds very bad but it is

27
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,930
basically the  simulation of

28
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,350
attack in a controlled manner of

29
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,790
what a criminal could do an

30
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,830
attacker on our network or on

31
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,750
our system on our application

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,960
ok this talk then falls, let's say, in the

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,790
hat of isaca venice for those

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,450
unfamiliar with isaca is a

35
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,270
world situation of auditors that has a

36
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,369
chapter  in venice quite important

37
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,159
that deals with computer

38
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,600
security application security for example there is an

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,439
event in venice soon found on the

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,450
site on the exact site venice you will find

41
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,210
all the information if they are not

42
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,340
yet posted in case look at us and go

43
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,100
beyond this then they are the

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,549
founder moderator man of the management

45
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,829
of security servers dotto jorge is a site that

46
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,780
has some mailing lists that deal

47
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,469
with computer security

48
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:01,049
then here from wikipedia paro paro you have

49
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,360
the various steps those that have been

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,810
let's say cataloged and cataloged of the various

51
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,429
steps of the industrial industry

52
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,500
l  action excuse the two spritzes from before they

53
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,079
begin to feel in particular m  I hear

54
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:16,180
what interests us now is the

55
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,299
so-called industry 40 which at the

56
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,659
end of the fair is nothing more than having

57
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:23,799
automated our systems even more than before

58
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:26,560
30 we

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,939
already had the numerically controlled machines

60
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,519
we already had a certain automation malay

61
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:33,389
the difference with  industry 4.0 is

62
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:36,400
the very strong exchange of data between

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,579
these machines and external systems the crm

64
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:41,200
the warehouse and so on

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,060
not only the interchange between

66
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,730
machines so on for those of you who know at

67
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,439
least an industrial plant if there

68
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,720
is not yet  fact, you will see that the new

69
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,629
devices, especially the big ones,

70
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:54,760
very often use ethernet cables directly

71
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,590
also to communicate between the

72
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,969
single pieces of the machine

73
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,340
ok so they have directly every

74
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,219
piece of the machine the m the

75
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:06,159
camera detector etc. they have an

76
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,900
embedded object with the

77
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,609
operating system and its pe  things like this

78
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:11,219


79
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,970
this thing here comes by itself ok

80
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,319
data exchange primarily on

81
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,180
the local network  so all the various parts

82
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,459
of the system so much so that we are talking about igs

83
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,739
scada so there is the control part and

84
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:26,379
the movement production detection part

85
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:29,560
etc. etc. in the

86
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,319
geographical network in the sense that by now many

87
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,269
companies maybe have the

88
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:37,359
canicattì system  and the management system that

89
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:39,220
manages orders and orders against

90
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,949
production at the headquarters in paperopoli

91
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:44,680
ok and even now it is very fashionable

92
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,049
even on the internet now there are also

93
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:48,939
industrial plants that

94
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:52,060
do not work without the cloud so there are

95
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,979
machine components that

96
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:56,349
speak  directly with the c.so as

97
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:57,669
a part of the cs that are

98
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:00,129
directly on the internet key

99
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:01,780
this because obviously being able to

100
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,150
control with automation with

101
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,489
integrated systems all that part of

102
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:08,319
production to enormous advantages

103
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,090
because they are in real time as much as

104
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,069
I produce I can take in real time

105
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:14,810
the orders change colors of the

106
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,850
thing of the chairs I can do a number of

107
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,488
things obviously also a lot of red  hi

108
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:21,709
because clearly if I expose all

109
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,320
this stuff on the internet or a potential

110
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,740
problem then those of you who know at

111
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,870
least the scope probably manufactures

112
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,980
these terms plc cs expires way low

113
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,030
etcetera

114
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,960
know them are all the various let's say

115
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,490
components of the traditional bass industry them

116
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,840
ok

117
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,200
what  it happened with industry 4.0 those of

118
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,389
you who have a job in a plant know

119
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:49,040
a fairly elaborate production plant by

120
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,650
now will have seen that

121
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,720
there is even a

122
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,490
plant data center to the plant data center

123
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,200
very often it is just like our

124
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,120
normal data center  of the network or

125
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,669
office of your network

126
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,410
there is simply a virtualization system

127
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,450
there are virtual machines that

128
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,400
run databases there are

129
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,830
windows operating systems there are

130
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,700
wifi networks very normal wi fi protocol we

131
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,970
strongly use the tcp ip

132
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,039
there are many  technologies that are

133
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,990
those used in the

134
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,830
traditional context also in the factory sector,

135
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,820
therefore all of them  what are the

136
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,400
attacks that are let's say already known

137
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,590
abundantly known in the

138
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,510
traditional outcomes are added to

139
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,880
those that can also be done

140
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,560
in the industrial sector when you hear

141
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,600
the ransom was blocked the production

142
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,750
of pippo tronic incorporated it is not

143
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,240
that it was a ramsauer script hardly

144
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,130
it was a run soru it is written on purpose to

145
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,100
connect via modbus and make

146
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,680
a certain controller go faster or slower

147
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,660
what the stuff the

148
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,850
mission impossible do stuxnet the secret services

149
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,360


150
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,990
ok when instead you hear about

151
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,330
production totally zero

152
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,160
layoffs for a week  etc.

153
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,500
because trivially some idiot

154
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,690
arrived with a laptop infected with

155
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,729
crypto locker this connected to the

156
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,470
share opened and configured by default

157
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,650
the server that runs a piece

158
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,450
of the system encrypted the data

159
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,889
the system stopped working and

160
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:19,820
finished  of the fair

161
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,890
ok so much so that if we go and see

162
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,090
not

163
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,860
a slide I have  I did but a

164
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,040
diagram that enisa made enisa is

165
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,620
let's say the European body that deals with the

166
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,970
protection of critical infrastructures

167
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,280
including central industrial plants,

168
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,060
etc., etc.

169
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,979


170
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:47,000


171
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,720
that is, the risks that can

172
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,780
impact on industrial plants do you

173
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,800
know someone by name obviously there

174
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,960
are almost all the same

175
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,820
risks that also impact a network of

176
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,070
very normal sites so let's talk about

177
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,710
malware let's talk about root keys let's talk

178
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,190
about money problems services and out

179
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,440
of communications and  let's talk about man in

180
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,190
the middle

181
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,930
ok etcetera etcetera etcetera then

182
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,240
the schemino that he made in isa in the

183
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,240
documentation then here everything mentioned and

184
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,830
in the end there are also some

185
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,510
references but the schemino he made

186
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,060
in isa to talk about security risks

187
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,710
in industrial plants, in

188
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,419
reality, he speaks of the security risks of

189
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:37,039
computer priests, not only of these

190
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,260
risks here when we have a network

191
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,120
an industrial plant the problem is

192
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,039
that these industrial plants being

193
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,900
born in the second of the third part

194
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,010
we say of industrialization

195
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,210
therefore industries we call the 3.0 ok

196
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,580
they were designed to live in a

197
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,740
closed ecosystem in a network that no one

198
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,169
else  accesses that no one else

199
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:03,080
arrives so imagine what is the

200
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,419
security mechanism that for example the

201
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,860
most used protocols in the

202
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,340
industrial sector have none exactly exactly

203
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,039
that ok clear communication no

204
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,260
type of authentication the packet says

205
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,490
that a packet of pins arrives from that machine

206
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,410
clear will come from

207
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,760
that machine on my network there is

208
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,860
no one else

209
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,860
in reality it is no longer so now if

210
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,229
you have your customer you have an

211
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:29,720
industrial plant in 99.9 percent

212
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,900
of cases it is directly or indirectly

213
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,419
connected to the internet directly because

214
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,900
maybe

215
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,960
from that network assigning them joined bio

216
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,730
getting assigned an ip vad  or on the

217
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,740
internet indirectly because if I don't

218
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,240
do it directly from that network I

219
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,490
go to the office network and from the

220
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,710
office network I go to the internet and vice versa

221
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,080
ok so an attacker who

222
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,180
smacks my office network with malware because

223
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,710
someone clicked the

224
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,780
wrong attachment to  luck, no one ever clicks

225
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,390
the wrong attachment obviously but if

226
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,310
someone clicks on the wrong attachment

227
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,960
in the office network and I have no

228
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,020
segregation and almost no one there is a series

229
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,450
a between the office network and the network or tim key

230
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,980
infection on the secretary's or

231
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,240
dell pc  'CEO is

232
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,800
indifferent to a non-technical user,

233
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,340
even better he brushes the whole network to

234
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,410
look for open shares vulnerabilities

235
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,660
etc. among the networks he finds there is also

236
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,950
the famous server used by

237
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,810
the cs component of my system that is

238
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,700
there to pick up the pieces or do things  of

239
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,830
this kind,

240
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,630
the design up to now in

241
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,410
industrial plants has been that of maximum

242
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,280
reliability, therefore of maximum

243
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,140
operation and ee spe  sso also of the

244
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,940
utmost simplicity default installations

245
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,510


246
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,250
what works you can't touch

247
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,700
etc.

248
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,500


249
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,990


250
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,180


251
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,780


252
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,420
we have

253
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,550
in the industrial field that this type of

254
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,260
systems have a life cycle a little

255
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,060
longer than a portable cabbage

256
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,430
any ok so or normally when I

257
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,410
plant when installing a

258
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,720
500 thousand euro million euro system I expect

259
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,570
it to have a life cycle of 10  years 15

260
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,450
years ok taken from three years I throw it

261
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,880
away four years I throw it away not only

262
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,220
are they often continuous cycle systems

263
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,270
so they have a

264
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,160
maintenance window that is maybe a week a

265
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,970
year

266
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,500
ok maybe they work from 6 in the morning

267
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,840
to ten in the evening they work  h24

268
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,240
not only if there are stalled

269
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,470
updates if I make some

270
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,480
changes I the manufacturer tells me no one

271
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,280
I guarantee you more than the system s  ia

272
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,380
actually correct function does

273
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,250
what it has to do

274
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,160
on a system that perhaps produces 100

275
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,740
thousand euros in value then start

276
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,880
playing with updates

277
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,640
this always from in isa is a

278
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,589
reference table let's say of what

279
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,490
are some types of attacks with the

280
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,610
level of criticality obviously against

281
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,740
administration system of ska from then

282
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,830
against ici esp art so if I enter the

283
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,529
sequel server that collects the

284
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:14,440
card data with the default password db a

285
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,520
di b ah ok

286
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,589
that is crucial obviously it is a

287
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,649
criticality and then it goes manually  all the various

288
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,029
parts and so on

289
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:26,920
ok then the first thing not to do is to

290
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,620
directly expose your

291
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,380
industrial plant on the internet which idiot

292
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,050
nobody would do it

293
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,899
oh my God maybe someone did this is

294
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,850
now a bit old but I think if

295
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,649
they did a scan  an

296
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,100
even more recent statistic would not change very

297
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,290
serious at the porto nation tuska from both it

298
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,140
and other such

299
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,430
discoveries exposed direct  mind on the

300
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,040
internet key in a scan on the

301
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,300
internet 115 thousand devices 95 thousand of

302
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,790
these were exposed on mobile

303
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,290
connections 3g gprs I have to do remote

304
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,029
manager in my industrial plant it takes

305
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:09,209
a nice umts tac modem

306
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:12,070
luckily in italy

307
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,350
sim connections to data are usually natta

308
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,750
so you do not have a public ip

309
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,520
I go to the supplier but I say I need

310
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,290
some public ip keep here your network

311
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,850
and the public ip ok

312
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,399
then above them there is the tell net http

313
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,680
the https what is of your

314
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,209
industrial plant on which obviously nobody

315
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:30,130
changed the default password and the

316
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,810
plant exposed on the internet has

317
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,880
any of you ever played with

318
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,850
shodan show give a search engine

319
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,990
that is used to search for many things including

320
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,459
even if you want industrial plants

321
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:48,010
if you go to shodan and search for

322
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,339
example here what  I searched

323
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,930
for siemens search for siemens for something that has

324
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,300
siemens in one of the service banners you

325
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,470
find 12,000 search for something more

326
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,110
specific

327
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:07,730
sneijder m  odbus then these queries are to

328
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,860
hell but obviously doing them

329
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,809
already knowing the object I have to

330
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:13,850
look for doing more

331
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,910
targeted searches in I get even more more

332
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,829
or less and so on simatic vague pfc

333
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:24,290
someone has it vague who does not c  'it is a

334
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,799
vague in its system it will be only

335
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,779
unimportant devices yes sure

336
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,759
like this that if I remember correctly it is

337
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,250
a central

338
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,750
one aspect in mexico usa it was a

339
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,520
central I think water a stuff of

340
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,080
this gene however the stuff quite

341
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,360
delicate ok exposed directly on

342
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,330
internet via vnc with

343
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,220
default credentials or even without credentials

344
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,600
those of you who have an industrial plant

345
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,340
will have noticed that very often the

346
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,800
producers of the hm you have to

347
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,320
remotely control the hm ai use vnc and why

348
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,610
put a password in it

349
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:03,510
just connect it happens only to idiots

350
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,300
type  tesla tesla is a hybrid company

351
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,400
they an it company of a high

352
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,290
tech company but it is also a manufacturer

353
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,240
there is also a meta manufacturer and they

354
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,430
broke it  or the cloud they used to do

355
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,430
crypto mining that if it happens tesla you want

356
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,730
it not to happen to the pippo tronic of

357
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,170
castelfranco veneto who makes those four

358
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,820
plants that I use my neighbor

359
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,300


360
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,260
I don't know I would ask myself some questions okay

361
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,220
then if it doesn't happen to you  do you realize

362
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,710
now one of the war bases of

363
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,420
the last few weeks the last few

364
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,000
months is simple in attack

365
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,190
what does it mean simple innate that if I

366
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,900
want to break through you and for some reason

367
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,670
I can't do it I don't want to attack you

368
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,040
directly but I background your

369
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,130
supplier  that surely there is a remote

370
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,170
manager a vpn etcetera

371
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:58,839
ok so one thing surely

372
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,870
that must be evaluated is the whole part of the

373
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,550
remote manager because it is clear that for

374
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,710
me it is much more convenient to have the

375
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,510
maintainer rather than having to

376
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,420
physically come to me with  the costs at the times

377
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,220
it entails can connect remotely

378
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,350
management and tell me immediately the system is

379
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,690
broken it's not broken do so do what, however,

380
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,260
must be done with grain salis already if fat  and

381
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,480
beware that this stuff here if

382
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,220
you do it in the network part of an

383
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,470
industrial plant should know how to do it

384
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,830
ok this is save in the sense that it does

385
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,750
nothing particularly dangerous already

386
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,089
if you put in it if you know the least sv in the maps

387
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,330
at least to a little risk the  another

388
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,150
day I was at a customer in the

389
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,570
food production sector and he gave me the rap

390
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,070
that a supplier had done more than

391
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,870
one complete over the whole network including the

392
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,850
systems I did so offense but

393
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,040
nothing broke but we had some

394
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,990
problems  something went a little slower

395
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,640
said you were very lucky because

396
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,680
if you run a wow sufferer even

397
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,020
just a little aggressive stuff

398
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,420
on the part of the system

399
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,130
nothing could happen but it could also

400
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,720
happen a mess so if you do

401
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,030
these things do them very very

402
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,860
carefully

403
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,930
another interesting thing is that

404
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,110
hackers like the part of cs expires because it

405
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,700
is fashionable because it is cool because it is not

406
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,610
something you can buy at home so

407
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,110
working on it, hacking at it and fun if

408
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,750
you go to this site called

409
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,760
cece things dot com is a

410
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,650
specialized site a search engine that

411
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,190
indexes only the abstracts the titles

412
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,020
of the speakers of the computer security conferences

413
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,070


414
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,870
you want to know what is the but at the state

415
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,870
of the art of  some technology

416
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,170
public

417
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,880
go to this site search not

418
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,410
and technology type search zigbee

419
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,360
search escada search for what you want

420
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,700
you find everything that

421
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,620
security researchers have

422
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,260
published at some conference which is the

423
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,000
way they have researched security

424
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,830
of advertising  doing marketing and

425
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,140
then selling, therefore, except for secret searches,

426
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,150
mission impossible ends

427
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:01,770
up indexed here of vulnerability

428
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,890
in a specific of the scada equipment

429
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,730
we talk about it since 2010 2011 2012 this is one

430
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,560
of the most interesting or with the most

431
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,119
interesting tones and of 2013

432
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,359
of which it has  what if a

433
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,040
cybersecurity company

434
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,680
deals with info security  rmatics and

435
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,869
security analysis we say offences

436
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,819
security what is said has done

437
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,609
an analysis in a series of apparatuses that

438
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:28,590
comes out of and has published a series of

439
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,770
vulnerabilities but we in 2019 in Italy

440
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,210
in our company in the north east do not

441
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,130
even have to get to  problem of

442
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,270
worrying if our

443
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,740
implementation of low mode and

444
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,930
vulnerable or not is that maybe

445
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,690
we do it in 5 10 15 20 years

446
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,490
now in the meantime let's make sure that they do

447
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,110
not get to talk with low mode

448
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,520
maybe not from the internet

449
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,480
ok this would already be a great 1

450
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,940
new advantage, however,

451
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,600
exploits specific attack techniques

452
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,040
for

453
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,860
the devices are

454
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,630


455
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,000
published.

456
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,160


457
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,140


458
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,179
I say that the

459
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:15,460
safety in the industrial sector is

460
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,540
probably the same as in

461
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,650
the normal sites  and in 2000 in 98

462
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,610
that is, there was no ok then always in isa

463
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,470
he published a series of best

464
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,240
practices I am not going to read them all because

465
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,919
otherwise we are here all day

466
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:32,360
then I tell you my check list

467
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,470
ok but on the check list of  enisa is

468
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,630
certainly well worth it is definitely

469
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,240
worth if you have if you sell this type of

470
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,919
equipment if they manage these few

471
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:45,350
devices to know it and read it ok

472
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,169
the first is included care it is mine

473
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,330
consideration of an iter design face off

474
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,450
you quit systems ok then the  first

475
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,160
thing that slowly because it is not a

476
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,450
process that you will do overnight

477
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,370
but that you have to start doing is with

478
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,350
your suppliers to start telling them

479
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,049
look that however I want to have certain

480
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,130
levels of safety

481
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,900
so much so that we do a

482
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,720
lot  check list on the proxies mn

483
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,429
therefore on the part of the acquisition of the

484
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:12,590
equipment you have when you to a

485
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,929
supplier who work and I absolutely do not want

486
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:16,100
to denigrate because I am not

487
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,309
able to make the electricity  on the contrary,

488
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:21,620
if I do it I die ok but people who

489
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,179
work as a computer security electrician

490
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:25,790
often do not know much about it that is they

491
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,530
simply follow the instructions

492
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,059
given to them by those who bought

493
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,950
the simer device yes but what is

494
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,780
sneijder what follows  the instructions

495
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,120
paro step and if he has to put a

496
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,309
password he will put siemens or he will put the

497
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,150
name of the customer

498
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,080
ok then I skip all the parts one with

499
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,350
the musical very important thing is on

500
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,440
the cs part expires and lilac the fact that

501
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,320
usually now as now who manages

502
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,390
the network  oti it is not who manages the network

503
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,580
you that therefore those who deal with

504
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,350
the production to choose the

505
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,390
machines to have it installed to keep them

506
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,720


507
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,179
are the staff at the normal sites so that it

508
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:05,909
sucks the management of normal servers

509
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:08,130
that if you have this situation

510
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,140
start talking if you are  in quarrels

511
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,000
with your counterpart who does today and

512
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,940
vice versa because surely talking to you

513
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,020
something comes out of use ok

514
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,059
then the best practices the assault  because

515
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,480
otherwise we go beyond the important thing that

516
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,850
I always show you from in isa is this

517
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,010
scheme is called isa 95 a very

518
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,010
famous scheme which is the theory therefore the optimum

519
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,200
in the management of

520
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,380
industrial plants from the part closest to

521
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,080
production so pl yes etc.

522
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,140
up to  office network up to the internet

523
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,220
count how many firewalls there are then

524
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,049
think about how many firewalls you have in

525
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,880
your system between the system network the

526
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,919
pieces of the system network between the

527
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,470
system network the office network

528
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,760
if you do not have the same number of

529
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,039
purely basic files you have a problem

530
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,600
one of the things that happen to me most often

531
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,390
to go to certain networks now then the

532
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,100
flat network where everything is attached

533
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,559
from the 100 thousand euro press to the

534
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,030
secretary's pc is difficult to find but it

535
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,070
still happens maybe there is already a certain

536
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,360
segregation in wlan

537
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,370
though  then if I do not do the filter between

538
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,620
these wlan that exposed the problem

539
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,780
from layer 2 and layer 3 but the problem is

540
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,320
the

541
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,780
same my advice is at 2 in 201  9

542
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,130
because my knowledge of what is

543
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,309
the gs environment expires in Italy my

544
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:31,440
advice is at the moment segregated and

545
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,870
segregated segregated therefore isolated the

546
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,600
wlan by production line even if

547
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,179
you can filter all the traffic between

548
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:39,780
the wlan

549
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,840
ok and is and is and is  so what in my opinion must be

550
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,770
done

551
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:47,220
the problem is that instead industries 40

552
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,539
they really like a project

553
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,929
called mass

554
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,350
in my opinion they forgot to

555
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,730
add an s at the bottom where to

556
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,780
call it omitted ok the mes what says that

557
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,850
anyone talks to anyone because the

558
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,120
crm knows  in real time if the customer

559
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,039
has placed the order he already sends the order to the

560
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,559
warehouse who already knows the instructions from jade

561
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,669
to

562
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:10,350
the productivity etc. then the message is

563
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,419
fine is certainly something that

564
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,999
all the customers who were three

565
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,799
not discharged want  one that makes you laugh

566
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,139
too but it's okay that the month an

567
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:20,909
integrated production system in which

568
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:23,009
everyone talks to everyone and everyone knows in

569
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,989
real time and everyone can interact

570
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:26,700
right on the proc  editing of the

571
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,600
production

572
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,519
then the mes is fine but it must be done

573
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,739
with a minimum of grain

574
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:33,929
salis my advice in this case is if

575
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:35,879
you have or if you don't have, let's say

576
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:37,710
segregation when I started to

577
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,779
put the file obviously you can't

578
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:41,609
think of putting the firewall on

579
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:42,480
and  do us all

580
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,220
because nothing works the next

581
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,720
day or rather the same day your

582
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,429
managing director takes them by

583
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:49,289
the ear throws back into the lim channel

584
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:51,619
that what needs to be done to do it well in the

585
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:54,840
meantime segregate above all the new 9

586
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,249
devices the new lines to start  to

587
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,799
segregate them when I have the possibility it

588
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,789
puts a firewall

589
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:01,049
obviously to do so must be

590
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:02,850
bodyworked in high reliability because

591
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,499
then when that goes down

592
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:06,299
the system goes down after which

593
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,669
I will probably have to do a good learning phase

594
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:12,029
so I will have to put the loc bol

595
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:14,429
and then  slowly flow by flow say

596
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:16,830
ok I like this and I put it I put a

597
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,690
rule in it and I take it out of the on

598
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,330
when I arrived at  know all the

599
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,739
various flows that run at that point

600
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:25,649
I can make us holden aiol game

601
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:28,619
soon it's a little bit the theory the

602
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:30,330
theory is easy the practice is very

603
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:34,489
difficult but in my opinion it's the only thing

604
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:37,230
here I put a minimum of  guideline

605
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,210
that in my opinion as a checklist it can

606
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,700
be useful that the security by design

607
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,639
at least started asking for it but its

608
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:46,499
safety in yours in your

609
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:48,659
plant in the object you are about to

610
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,279
sell us how it is managed what how it

611
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,090
works ok collaboration between pilots

612
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,039
that is if you are  nor rotti you can't

613
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:59,100
think of arriving at the

614
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,330
construction sites bon this is the new press

615
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,679
this is the network cable melo connect give

616
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,529
me an ip you have to talk to us a little earlier

617
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:06,779
if you are in the rites you

618
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,450
have to ask your oti what it does

619
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,249
that thing how many network points does it

620
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,830
need what kind of traffic does it do

621
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,269
how remote management works

622
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:18,359
ok collaboration of course with

623
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,919
third party suppliers keep in mind that

624
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,840
many of the vulnerabilities I find  I

625
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,909
am not even linked to the

626
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:26,760
final manufacturer in siemens etc. but they are linked to the

627
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,929
installer because those

628
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:29,730
installers who have been used for 20 years who

629
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,549
come here put the machine on

630
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:35,190
with a network cable must create a

631
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,200
user for some kind creates it with the

632
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,419
name siemens  immense siemens

633
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:40,320
company name etcetera

634
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,320
ok siemens as sneijder is all these

635
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,770
people here from 2010 2012 onwards the

636
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,570
safety part is pumping it because

637
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,279
the market asks them especially

638
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,679
those super sons I think of the investigating judge of those

639
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:54,870
who produce the boeing fighter planes

640
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,399
and of course  who ask him for

641
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:59,399
certain types of safety levels and

642
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,960
the market adapts but my

643
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,789
installer back here who has always

644
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:05,130
done the same thing for twenty years

645
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,510
until I am

646
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,140
asking him

647
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,100
surely will not talk about it then oh well I have

648
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,169
about you revision  from someone who

649
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:15,029
knows what he is looking at who looks at the

650
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:16,590
flows he tells you but he is [ __ ] here how he

651
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,990
talks about things like this obviously

652
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,510
d  to a third party because it cannot be

653
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,890
that he sells you the plant that tells

654
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,299
you everything is in order there is in an iron barrel

655
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:24,779


656
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,100
from the point of view of safety

657
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,210
because in my opinion everything does not add up

658
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,200
another important thing is the

659
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,970
documentation  detailed assets

660
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,740
very often in a factory network you

661
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,360
don't even know what the hell is inside because

662
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,250
the stuff is layered over the

663
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,740
years but also trivially not even from

664
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,820
a security point of view even

665
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,350
trivially if

666
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,520
a machine firmware breaks or so  via

667
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,799
the famous image the meme that runs on the

668
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,409
internet with the floppy system

669
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:54,809
counterattacked magnet I happened to

670
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:55,980
find customers who are exactly

671
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,940
in that situation

672
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,250
there is only one floppy that makes is the only one that

673
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,330
is able to start with the

674
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,429
machine  it is not even known if there are

675
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:05,070
pairs or even more trivial things it conceals a

676
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,570
part of the system is made up of

677
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,039
hardware so old that

678
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,890
mfm disks are needed find an am fm disk in

679
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,539
2019 more then the trad one  traditional because

680
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:18,120
the super cool siemens switches that

681
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,649
put you in the factory network are

682
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:20,940
exactly the same as

683
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,679
the cisco surface switches etc. they have

684
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,330
exactly the same problems if

685
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,620
you don't put a password on them they don't have

686
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,450
a step back in changes levo

687
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,679
change it what you want

688
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,860
ok hardening now  a big word,

689
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,950
however, at least for the part

690
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,779
you use in the network or you then if the

691
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:39,500
sequel server is stalled maybe the user who

692
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,600
does not have the user of ba compass dba

693
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,669
ok maybe disable what is not

694
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:45,049
needed etc. a

695
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:46,639
lot of attention to the remote

696
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:49,190
management part and  then also the

697
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,559
monitoring and log management part I do not say

698
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,990
to get to have

699
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,179
both the factory network attached to yours but slowly but

700
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:57,679
slowly you can think of at least the

701
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,480
easiest part for you to understand

702
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,250
so windows server and these things here

703
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,500
if they shoot in  place on your sim that you

704
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,210
already obviously have to analyze the

705
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,440
events in the outcomes network it is not bad to

706
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,389
think of the blacksmiths network  ca in acam and you

707
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:13,250
don't know how many times I happen to go

708
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,039
to a customer to trivialize the situation a bit

709
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,470
then I tell him but then you

710
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,450
internet does not need much we internet

711
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,240
is not important so I can turn off the

712
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,519
internet this is this and it is internet

713
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,480
sisi

714
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,789
but before that  I spend it sorry you

715
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:30,320
told me there is the factory in canicattì

716
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,110
psi and the orders are sent to him by the s400

717
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,110
which is almost there and the two how they communicate

718
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,750
on the internet good so if the internet is

719
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,190
broken you do not leave the trucks from

720
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,740
canicattì right and you have  a

721
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,139
two lire ADSL cabbage

722
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:46,909
ok as main line there is no

723
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:49,429
backup etc. life cycle the

724
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:52,460
equipment contracts but intense

725
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,769
firmware updates etc.

726
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:58,220
ok installation backups

727
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,230
so the procedures to know how to

728
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,580
withdraw on a system I don't say  that

729
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,010
you have to do it but since in five

730
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,480
ten fifteen years maybe the product

731
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,399
of that plant has failed or no

732
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:10,070
longer supports it ok if in 15 years

733
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,080
that plant breaks down you have to evaluate it then

734
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,820
even there I happened to arrive in

735
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,669
production chains where there is a single

736
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:18,500
very old machine that is part of

737
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,880
the production process that is no longer

738
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,769
supported because it has not been

739
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,450
bought back which costs 500 thousand euros

740
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,970
very well but if that one breaks you will not

741
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,529
produce  for a day and it costs you 4

742
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:29,330
million euros so you are telling me

743
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,710
that not replacing a car in the race

744
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,139
500 thousand euros is risking to lose 4

745
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:35,389
million euros a day

746
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:37,039
this is called business impact

747
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,080
analysis is something that I recommend then

748
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,060
in the next slide ok

749
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,100
communications  wireless a lot of

750
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,230
these businesses have bluetooth they have

751
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,950
wifi they have wifi networks to

752
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:52,890
keep basic us internet no internet

753
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,750
means that one must not be exposed

754
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,600
directly from the internet an internal rdp

755
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,120
between one thing but two even that either  the

756
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,310
net was manufacturing on the internet

757
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:06,960
ok because obviously the first thing that

758
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,670
a malware will do a virus such a

759
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,620
thing is to go on the internet

760
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,240
try to do a

761
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,300
communication channel etc.

762
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,980
then in the field of business impact

763
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,540
analysis that is to know my

764
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,050
production process how it works where if

765
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,970
something breaks I stop and how much it

766
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,010
costs me if I stop and how long it takes

767
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,800
to start again

768
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,970
the IT risk analysis ok

769
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,470
you will have already done for the risk to the

770
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,620
sites it is also similar for the part or

771
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,120
vulnerability analysis

772
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,920
attack simulation it is very good attention that

773
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,360
now I have seen people saying let

774
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,330
's do the down the network factory with grain

775
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,010
salis made someone do it who knows how to do it

776
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,200
if not  to do marketing, however, rather

777
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,110
not let it arrive, someone must arrive

778
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,820
who attacks a spinning device placed on

779
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,170
the factory network without knowing what he

780
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:52,830
is doing

781
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,830
perhaps it is better not to do it

782
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,480
obviously the analysis part has

783
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,010
responded to the incidents intended

784
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,210
above all as

785
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,950
production accidents so if I  enters a crypto

786
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,660
locker and I stop the

787
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,300
production database and know how I can

788
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,190
pull up on the back up of the day p  rhyme how

789
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,330
do i start again

790
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,460
ok then try also it is always in the

791
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,410
business impact analysis with the

792
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,930
critical points to understand which are the parts

793
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,510
that need to restart it

794
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,030
was obviously not pt

795
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,130
specialist skills on the field and cs expires

796
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,840
i hope there are always some  more, however,

797
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,840
even today, let's say

798
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,140
probably the wheat is not the bread

799
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,610
for all those who do my work

800
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,860
so pay a minimum of attention to

801
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,050
who knows who you call and let me say that he has

802
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,940
already worked in the field to say and demonstrate

803
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,300
that he has  already worked in certain areas

804
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,070
okay I told you I put some

805
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,540
references here that are those just

806
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,100
base base base base

807
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,350
now it is so fashionable it is not specific

808
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,770
to the timac sonicis critical

809
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,179
control cheese 20 field which is so fashionable

810
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:57,950
in the high city field you can think of

811
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,710
reasoning about that at least try it

812
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:04,400
also in the field in the field it is okay

813
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,830
for you I would say that for today I have nothing more to tell

814
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,630
you so if you have something to ask me

815
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:27,110
vog  lio to tell me gladly here we

816
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:33,340
are thank you I was wondering there

817
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,690
are recognized certifications are in

818
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,159
Europe for this kind of security

819
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,820
that is, there are private individuals who can do

820
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,299
the attack tests give their

821
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:51,950
result but there is a standard then

822
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,600
there is no standard and also in the

823
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,210
field  the inaccurate city so imagine

824
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,460
if there is one in the field of you is

825
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,990
something that is being debated especially

826
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,730
in the United States we are starting to

827
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,520
talk about certification of plants

828
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,159
in Italy for example as soon as

829
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,429
the legislation has now come out let's say that it concerns

830
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,289
critical infrastructures have been

831
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:15,020
400 critical infrastructures and routes have been surveyed

832
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,400
so people who produce

833
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,190
energy people who know about gadgets era and

834
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,110
these have a series of guidelines

835
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,480
that they must begin to comply and

836
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,750
that they will have to begin to do and it is

837
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,220
roughly based on those could

838
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,710
be a cheese 20 a bit  a bit different a

839
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,500
bit but roughly is the one with some

840
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,419
more things some less things though that

841
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:37,700
I know there are still no

842
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,070
standards that tell you do so do what

843
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,809
instead opens to lisa 95 who tells you how to

844
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:44,179
do the layout but on the part of

845
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:47,210
controls there is one of the documents

846
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,549
cited in a document of the ministry

847
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:51,409
in the  american standard technology institute

848
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:53,929
is the body that standardizes

849
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:55,880
everything in america from how to use

850
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,220
the toilet brush knows how to manage the

851
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,290
safety checks of the plants

852
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,560
has made a handy 890 page manual

853
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,960
that you can comfortably while using the

854
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,110
brush read and use what we say

855
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,820
basically i now rai based on what

856
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:18,620
enisa says which is a little lighter there

857
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,650
are other questions

858
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:26,510
here first a question if you hear it did you

859
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,610
mention shodan is clearly

860
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,920
experience in industry and i wanted to know

861
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,400
if you have any idea what happens when

862
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,260
someone finds a  vulnerability and

863
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,060
mentions it cer from the computer emergency

864
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,200
response team

865
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,630
if this is a few slices or if the

866
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,920
security researcher should

867
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,750
risk going straight  from

868
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,180
companies that are vulnerable

869
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,180
then in Italy this thing is not very

870
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,340
well defined in the sense that you could

871
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,980
always be denounced

872
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,960
the article of the other day came out

873
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,000
security researchers acquitted but in the meantime acquitted

874
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,560
means that you take a trial

875
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,000
they take you back a lawyer and a breakdown of

876
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,490
boxes that there are projects such as

877
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:07,340
laupen bug bounty that try to

878
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,739
collect the reports and if to act as

879
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:12,918
an intermediary between the researcher who

880
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:13,969
reports the report

881
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,440
but if I had to give you some advice

882
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,380
right now I would tell you how Montalbano would say, do

883
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,370
your dicks

884
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,110
unfortunately, or you do as you do in

885
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,730
these cases a nice report

886
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,830
that you are not traceable and so on

887
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,690
also because then in Italy

888
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,340
the other matter also comes into play for which you

889
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,500
say the highest good faith in the world you report it to him,

890
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,210
etc. then  you say

891
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,400
maybe I can also help you if you want

892
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,949
risks already that it is a blackmail ok

893
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,780
so basically I would be very careful clear that

894
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,190
if you find a vulnerability in a

895
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,630
critical infrastructure

896
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,100
at that point I would make an

897
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,679
anonymous report an anonymous one to decide to the

898
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,290
sert it that eventually manages the

899
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,300
thing but if the report concerns

900
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,130
pippo tronica srl which is not a

901
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:59,900
critical infrastructure it is very complex

902
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,840
or  you can have let's say now for

903
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,180
example how it worked for Russian for

904
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,520
these things here you go on twitter and try

905
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,030
to make sure

906
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,400
that there is a coverage behind

907
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,990
you that can help you in this thing here

908
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,180
but I mean the case of Russian was

909
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,890
however, it was striking to arrive at the airport and in the

910
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,140
meantime he said that he was denouncing him,

911
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,400
then luckily he changed his mind about the

912
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,600
pressure of public opinion

913
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,730
if the report on pippo tronica

914
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:28,330
srl maybe does not have all this feedback,

915
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:32,890
here is good then thanks to an applause to

916
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,339
cota
