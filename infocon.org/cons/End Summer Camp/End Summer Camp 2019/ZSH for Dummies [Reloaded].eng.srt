1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
good evening welcome back indeed I do not know if you

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,659
want to do some production if

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,069
lostiana mam introduced alone so much

4
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,210
am I always I am always the alliance of the

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,349
first talk

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,620
I hope you have eaten enough but

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,279
not too much I hope not to get bored and

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,779
make them fall asleep that in this talk

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,340
tonight I will talk to you  great request

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,350
of the deed and taxes h

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,170
for those who have been here at the esc for a long time zs

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,140
h is the first talk I did at the esc

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,130
quite a few years ago and so now I

14
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,450
take it back I do it again because maybe there is

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,980
someone who does not  is still

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,260
heard first of all there is someone who

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,790
by chance has never heard of

18
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,040
ze bag high hands or well well well come

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,760
on there is some one so it must esse h

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,910
is a shell as the name implies

21
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,890
so if l  'inter activates in the meantime a set of

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,550
commands very similar to ksh if

23
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,170
those who know it, however, are

24
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,570
compatible with low and all the rest

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,220
of let's say the sh of celebrities is

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,830
smarter because it can emulate

27
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,869
others the behavior of others  sel is

28
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,580
very powerful and I think it is the most

29
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,960
powerful shell he had ever encountered

30
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,500
and it is really easy to extend it in fact we

31
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,540
will support bass emulation and if

32
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,650
h and it is really

33
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,070
very customizable so much so that it has let's say

34
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,119
18 different manual voices and then  there is

35
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,479
one that eats sh all that to all

36
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,490
the items together which is convenient if you have to

37
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,460
look for something

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,790
the strengths the more the

39
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,610
more I use the more stronger here

40
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,830
if you pass me the pun are the

41
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,210
tav completion that is the sciacca  is the

42
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:51,720
shell

43
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,160
if you want to do if you want to have some

44
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,660
really good good tab completion they are

45
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,210
programmable and spendable spoilers

46
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,610
in truth later completion ninja sh are

47
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,830
shell functions so practically

48
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,240
a shell function is performed

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,979
interactively every time you press

50
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,390
tab another really convenient thing  and the

51
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,310
koman system is shared

52
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,280
that is if I want fifty

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,970
open terminals write a command I recover it with

54
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,440
the arrow up from another terminal

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,000
from u  n another terminal on the same

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,980
computer which is really convenient for

57
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,750
example if you use team books with 50 thousand

58
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,870
open sky

59
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,330
the globe ying is also very powerful i.e.

60
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,430
it is not the usual asterisks in the

61
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,290
question mark and we will see it after all the things

62
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,750
that can be done.

63
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,370
true arrays then this

64
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,250
thing here we say is a bit of a unique thing

65
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,310
in truth low in the latest versions it has

66
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,060
supported including support for arrays

67
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,550
but people if h also associative area

68
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,870
for example supports

69
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,650
spelling correction of life and then integrated i.e.

70
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,049
you know what commands exist in the  mine in

71
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,630
my in viron mn so if I give a

72
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,330
command with a wrong letter she

73
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,310
selectable me already maybe you meant

74
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,489
this command here that also often

75
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,720
saves we say to rewrite it to the

76
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,190
supporters n indirect risks are

77
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,890
practically aliases for the folders

78
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,519
are already integrated in the shell supports

79
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,340
really advanced editing and here you

80
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,110
can open a whole chapter in the sense

81
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,540
that the line editor that is q  uello that

82
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,489
allows me to write some text and

83
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:38,580
writes it in my command line and to

84
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,350
itself a module and can be extended by

85
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,319
other modules

86
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,030
because precisely all the operation of

87
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,450
z sh is based around these modules that

88
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,609
one can load are remodels some

89
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,049
are  even libraries then a

90
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,069
module point them or that you want to

91
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,069
download in the shell you can load

92
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,109
precisely from the mathematical functions to a

93
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:59,060
complete ftp client integrated in the

94
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,439
shell

95
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,150
then it was born let's say it is not recent and born

96
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,469
in the 90's challenge to faust and among

97
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:11,810
other things when  he realized that

98
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,500
his professor's username was an

99
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,738
interesting name for a shell that the z sh and

100
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:20,630
then from there was born a bit the

101
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,970
whole story precisely the same basic is

102
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,030
practically indistinguishable from da bash

103
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,460
so i know beige walks

104
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,080
saga  without any problem and they

105
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,280
use it that even so that it has

106
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,240
changed in fact it supports true arrays

107
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,210
unlike beige invent as

108
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,280
I said the latest versions han  no

109
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,610
arrays also support associative

110
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,070
advanced parameter expansion so

111
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,090
many times it spares you another

112
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,310
call a duck shell

113
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,199
among other things as interesting the

114
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,750
variables let's say compatible with beasts

115
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,680
pop up cd part febaf which are these the

116
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,360
last two are bz  sh are represented

117
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,750
in two ways both as a string divided by

118
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,599
colon as the as instead and as

119
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:15,259
true arrays in the pocket because of course you

120
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:17,449
know that it supports them as a bonus if I

121
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:20,030
add the same directory as an array

122
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,800
obviously he doesn't add it to me because he

123
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,289
and uses a  set then knows what

124
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:26,380
directories are already present in the pub

125
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,400
so this is an example of the

126
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,169
syntax so in numeric rai it is

127
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:32,719
simply the same variable in

128
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:35,240
brackets separator space instead

129
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,550
now I knew you have to declare it

130
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,510
first the syntax is identical

131
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,980
another very convenient thing if you

132
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,540
write particularly complex shell scripts

133
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:50,480
is that the expansions of

134
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,400
the array indices undergo

135
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,710
arithmetic expansion q  so I can write

136
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,110
inside as if as if it were as if

137
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,300
I were in double round brackets let's say

138
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,440
for those who know beige

139
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,010
so I do the calculations to clear the

140
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:10,130
minds instead we use a 7 or empty the

141
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,080
globe in are there where one really

142
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,420
starts using d '  age sh as you can see

143
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,090
that I save you enough time so

144
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,800
basic globe and those with the asterisk

145
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,050
note of question and anything else are

146
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,370
supported like those in beige sh it is

147
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,190
understood that the manita is that there is the double

148
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,080
asterisk that  a recursive globe then

149
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,760
he takes from that folder and

150
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,950
all the folders onwards so in

151
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,720
most cases the find is no

152
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,310
longer needed practically you do it directly in the

153
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,120
shell supports supports the

154
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,910
alternate match so I can

155
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,980
directly support to keep it part in two

156
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,420
matches both one  what another

157
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,270
very nice thing is the extended globe and so

158
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,460
in this here is a shell option that

159
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,240
you can activate and it adds some

160
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,010
other ways to do globe in then to

161
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,480
example you can negate a pattern then

162
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,650
select all the files that

163
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,080
do not make a pattern

164
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,240
or you can have repeated patterns

165
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,620
so in the basic case the one there

166
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,460
repeats it I think

167
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,830
once is the one with double with double

168
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,210
hash repeats it two or more times

169
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:28,650
globe which fire are  another thing

170
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,999
we say similar to similar to the globe in that

171
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,830
it works hand in hand and is placed in

172
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,289
round brackets at the end of my blog

173
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:40,229
so they allow me to specify for

174
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:42,509
example as in find the file

175
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:44,930
type the type of file I am looking for or

176
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,219
attributes  file these things here are

177
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,710
very nice but the reality is that

178
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,479
many times you do not remember what is the

179
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,069
right syntax for this we use

180
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:00,289
let's say a reference card that I

181
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:04,110
suggest here it is quite

182
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,960
condensed and therefore here we all have

183
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,740
the former mansion all  the various parameters

184
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:19,259
now we find the globes which fires and

185
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,789
this is the reference card there are

186
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:23,509
fourteen pages of reference cards

187
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:37,289
so yes then globe which fires

188
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,979
selection of the here  What about her

189
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,779
so these are all the things I

190
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,389
can look for so directory is no longer

191
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:48,420
obviously also the globes files can

192
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,069
be negated combined so for the mt

193
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:57,829
directory use known directories f then

194
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,449
symbolic link files nor in pipe socket

195
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:04,620
arguments so this is just full

196
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,300
find let's say

197
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,470
then there are if you have listened to the

198
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,329
6 gb audit top

199
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:14,010
then if tweedy then look for them

200
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,610
directly from the shell if you want

201
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,899
then this with the permissions just

202
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,470
specifying the permissions specifying the

203
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,130
username the user with which to search

204
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,130
loughner

205
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,630
then these there  they are even

206
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,279
even here so I'm discovering

207
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,650
too so there are

208
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,170
really many of these and sometimes the

209
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,279
ones that are used the ones that I

210
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,590
say use the most are the slice for the

211
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,610
directory

212
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,290
so if I'm interested in having all

213
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,850
the list of all  directories use slash

214
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,520
or the at sign to search for

215
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,410
symbols the files that are at the end are the

216
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,060
ones that are also used by type for

217
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,839
the  es

218
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,300
so let's say the standard syntax

219
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,080
here is this so here there was also an

220
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,839
example so I look for everyone in

221
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,990
the ds folder or been ai what was the

222
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,800
single hash was 801 then in

223
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,080
the bino folder in the s min folder

224
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,630
I look for all those that are editable

225
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,150
by  all I should have 0 let's say

226
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,920
another very powerful thing are the

227
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,310
aliases if you know it supports two other

228
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,650
types of aliases besides the normal ones

229
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,720
let's say they are the us loeb ali that

230
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,110
can be expanded everywhere

231
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,390
everywhere in the line so I mean

232
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,580
for example a classic to tastings

233
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,350
uppercase cheering pipe so it

234
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,790
would no longer do parts great friezes

235
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,650
uppercase space d capital space al then go

236
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,290
ahead and sides are obviously a

237
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,880
bit dangerous because if by chance you

238
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,770
happen to have a capital g

239
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,480
inside your command line it

240
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,480
obviously comes  is scattered and another

241
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,040
very nice thing are iaria sti

242
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,350
suffix among other things this is something

243
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,170
that I use it practically almost only for

244
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,960
one thing and that is I have set as

245
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,010
suffix alias it agip clon so if I have to

246
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,110
if I have to clone a deposit I

247
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,630
copy allure l paste him the bikes I send

248
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,550
and less clone automatically which is

249
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,560
quite comfortable for me that I am lazy

250
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,880
and the other thing also rather

251
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,060
interesting are the shell extension

252
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,450
so the technology expansion as

253
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,390
some may already know there is someone

254
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,040
who has never heard of

255
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,030
dollar exclamation point for example below

256
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,630
ok

257
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,860
when you have reason dollar

258
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,530
replaces you at that at that moment of

259
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,780
that at that  position that if

260
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,090
typicality milk replaces you the last

261
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,380
parameter of the last command that you

262
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,970
executed that is the last

263
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,640
last argument or another

264
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,740
another very much used also the

265
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,780
exclamation point exclamation point that

266
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,700
directly replaces the whole

267
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,200
command all the last  command that

268
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,230
executed typical case is execute something

269
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,690
gives you up and it is right I have to do

270
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,070
only south exclamation point exclamation point

271
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,560
emiri  redo the same command

272
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,900
with sudo obviously I can with the 2 points

273
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,880
I can select any command

274
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,620
because when we are activating it calls

275
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,640
active by default it takes the last

276
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,460
command if it puts a number

277
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,110
obviously goes to look for them in the fistula back

278
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,190
obviously also supports

279
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,840
negative numbers so it goes  in the other

280
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,170
sense

281
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,420
the expansion of parameters are let's say

282
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,030
like those like those of low and there

283
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,440
are some modifiers that

284
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,540
allow you to directly edit the

285
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,010
variable then directly modify

286
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,560
the variable in the moment of

287
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,610
expansion

288
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,770
so for example if I use the  u

289
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,400
capital letter makes me everything in africa

290
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,930
obviously yes it does not change the variable

291
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,370
itself simply the expansion will be

292
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,240
all in a because

293
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,820
I ordered some kg that had active

294
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,530
here too there are quite a few here at the

295
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,280
bottom these are the expansion

296
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,840
piquet tracks that  I said before these are the

297
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,760
world selectors obviously they

298
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,860
also take you because you can if in addition to

299
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,630
selecting  and let's say in the chi store and

300
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,430
back and forth in the chi story then

301
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,810
select it also based on the

302
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,310
position of the command then forward

303
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,599
back in the command

304
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,820
here we are variable expansion here

305
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:43,290
so it counts the characters capitalizes the

306
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,940
u and knows why

307
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,190
[Music]

308
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,170
orders from one side from  other makes the

309
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,060
automatic quota these also convenient

310
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,560
in the scripts so it

311
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,700
automatically adds the ibex in its double and

312
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,470
double shares of the single symbol to the pc

313
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,899
or strips the shares even if they are

314
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:10,110
all things that come in handy state

315
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:15,149
minister freezing here we say the

316
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:16,829
automatic corrections and the general

317
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:18,450
the completion wing would go there another

318
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,390
top just to explain the completion

319
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,610
because they are really complex

320
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,620
exactly in essence there is an array that

321
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,420
tells you all the various computers that are

322
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,800
tested when you press the tab

323
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,350
then the first computer that for example

324
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,670
is tried  is what expands you to

325
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,920
expand the alias folder for

326
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,959
example mine I want to see that ayas and

327
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,600
writes a squeeze area  uta writes the

328
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,360
command that would be executed or there is

329
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,320
complete the file in the complete folder to the

330
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,930
complete directory or then there is the

331
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,730
one that calls the

332
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,620
completion function of the command itself so if

333
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,610
the command to an accomplice a defined

334
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,850
calls it another widget that  there is correct

335
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,800
the rocco corrects the errors so if

336
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,920
I have made a typo

337
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,589
in my command for no tav and lipu can

338
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:16,140
already correct the error

339
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,269
all these all these things here all

340
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:20,640
these behaviors are configurable

341
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,029


342
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,400
with z styles which in essence  it is a

343
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,860
kind of database key

344
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,570
hierarchical value integrated in the choice it

345
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,280
allows me to configure all the

346
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,980
parameters we say in the shell and the

347
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,960
nice thing and that then every shell script every

348
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,700
every computer can take this

349
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,830
key value and we say configure

350
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:54,500
when it is called then for how long

351
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,660
it concerns the jole directions other

352
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,350
comfortable things than bush

353
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,380
one is the classic ampersand towards this

354
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,780
here they told me  or that there is however

355
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,850
also in beige that making

356
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,040
automatic director already standard in

357
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,500
protesting from the ohr directly to

358
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,440
what you say to him in short, another

359
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,660
thing is a nice thing and that

360
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,840
if you put yourself in the same command he takes

361
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,330
the complete pass of the  command that in the

362
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,520
case of if you have some alias

363
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,550
already defined with the name

364
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,899
and you still take the

365
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,990
complete command this here is convenient and then it

366
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,600
also does prostitution so you can create

367
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,680
a file descriptor on the fly with the auto of

368
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,680
a command then you then for  example

369
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,050
instead of making a command save it

370
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,850
to a file another command savallo

371
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,829
to a file and then make the dis of the two

372
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:56,260
files you can make of the two commands

373
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,760
using let's say the direction to take

374
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,730
open round and then you

375
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,360
do this on the fly

376
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,480
here we are talking about samples tar completion

377
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,750
is as I said it is much more powerful than

378
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,020
that of beige in two systems the

379
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,309
old one com ctl which is

380
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:18,380
practically no longer used is quite

381
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,500
similar to best completion to understand

382
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,480
their systemic comsys is based all

383
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,410
around shell functions it is

384
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,720
precisely the possibility of

385
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,250
using widgets that are

386
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,830
ready to help you write

387
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:41,090
your completion then here we are

388
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,820
also talking about z styles so who are you going to

389
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,960
storage  for your settings as

390
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,780
you see below in the example this one

391
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,290
asterisk matches all the others

392
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,140
all the other hierarchy so too much

393
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,400
the string and the asterisk team

394
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,230
currently as like the global pattern

395
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,640
but there is all the people all the hierarchy

396
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,340
so  the first line silk verbose and on

397
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,310
all of them the line after only on the

398
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,110
command only on the kill compilation

399
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:15,510
puts me verbose no while yes exact

400
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,250
same for the other let's say they

401
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,350
are hierarchical the precise hierarchy

402
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,600
depends on the completion by the

403
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,300
computer itself and therefore  it is difficult to

404
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,990
say a general thing but here we say

405
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,030
the wing in fourth place of speed kills

406
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,690
if I remember correctly there should be the

407
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,450
name of the computer

408
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:46,190
here now  let's see a bit of so

409
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,840
then

410
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:58,340
then it loses sh there have been created

411
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:05,029
a whole series of plug ins

412
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:12,830
ok give yourself a look you know ok then

413
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,360
let's start from something more

414
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:20,149
step these are all the various series

415
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:22,610
of options that you can give to 6

416
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,470
these are also in beige if top

417
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,820
ok some nice things are auto cd auto

418
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,830
cv it simply means that if I

419
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,700
put them only the folder he

420
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,539
automatically makes me comfortable bus of is

421
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:40,129
also very convenient in the sense that he

422
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:42,950
keeps track of all the folders

423
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:50,200
where I move echo and I with pop

424
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,990
back is another nice thing and

425
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,860
that cv and interactive so if I do

426
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,748
cidim and 180 cv

427
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:11,360
I will be a

428
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,928
cleared functional dj

429
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,890
nice of the direct

430
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,330
this however should go there

431
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,610
looks cd minus one me  it goes to download

432
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:33,220
here it works I don't know why maybe a here is

433
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,150
finally c less so so I

434
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:43,150
can move back and forth in

435
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,530
my stack of folders so he

436
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,260
keeps all the stack carton with the cv

437
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,090
I can and  are the folder directly if

438
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,590
the folder doesn't interest me anymore

439
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,140
I can pop out pump out

440
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,950
the spac folder I'm fine then

441
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,610
other things complete other interesting things

442
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,120


443
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,070
ok correct let's try to do

444
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,429
[Music]

445
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,940
so here it is this way

446
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,710
right now  he realized that that

447
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,440
command does not exist there mine

448
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,659
automatically suggests another command based

449
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:23,909
on this too is configurable based on

450
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:26,549
how much distance is

451
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:28,050
lerins time distance

452
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,620
let's say he tries to suggest I

453
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,840
can do an abort or this does reddit

454
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,680
other  strange things right away we don't

455
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,800


456
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,539
go

457
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,940
there so here are these and the file that I

458
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,419
use to enable the completion here I

459
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:59,700
load the complete that the

460
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,440
completion system for example this is what

461
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,010
I was telling you and the order of

462
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,410
completion then mine  computer does

463
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,260
first expands

464
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,140
all variables or aliases and whatever else

465
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,600
then tries to complete then approximates

466
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,930
with style one

467
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,370
then adds all co  if you ignore it

468
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,340
because basically I can tell him for

469
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:23,850
example

470
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,550
well we will see it we will see below explains them

471
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:32,210
later and then why I take it

472
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,730
[Music]

473
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,280
then try to correct then try

474
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,320
approximate then add more things

475
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,480
and then try to add instead of

476
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,490
adding after add first and then

477
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,740
he simply searches in the history because

478
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,270
he can't find anything else so he

479
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,280
tells me look he executed this command

480
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,690
in the history provide you are still

481
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,540
right if if it is not

482
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,580
new skies this here is simply to

483
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,110
speed it up because obviously they are

484
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,670
shell scripts so some

485
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,610
can also run at  long to

486
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,270
speed up let's say the tabs use this

487
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,120
hughes cash so that you are basically results

488
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,600


489
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,370
well these the sorting where where it gives me

490
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:18,540
the how mimì presents let's say the

491
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,170
compilations based on the modification time

492
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,350
important then I have to see a few

493
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,430
things

494
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,920
here we are this is  this is the part

495
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,110
that configures my computer to kill

496
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,669
so

497
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:39,440
when I kill I can do

498
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,029
qu  then here this here is given sciacca

499
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:45,179
it is no strange external command woe

500
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,909
just z saccà who knows how to make me

501
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:49,320
complex and also shows me the preview

502
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:59,489
of everything this here this is

503
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:01,710
the north one I was talking about before

504
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,609
basically me in base  at the command I can

505
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,929
define that I do not complete me or

506
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:09,419
ignore me in the first version

507
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:13,009
let's say ignore some types of files

508
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:16,679
so these in online is quite

509
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,590
particular it is telling me that for the

510
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,580
commands then rmv vim of femme ev

511
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,169
automatically ignores me the file that is

512
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:27,509
already present on the line so it does not

513
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,700
lead me to reintroduce the same file

514
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,379
because obviously for these commands

515
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:33,119
introducing it twice and twice the

516
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:35,070
same fi does not make sense that is it removes it

517
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,929
twice and then I can tell it

518
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:39,210
ignore it ignores me a

519
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:43,690
thousand files duplicated in works  it is another

520
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,330
quite convenient thing for example if I

521
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,250
do precisely point cd point point

522
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,200
slash I press tab it is useless to

523
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,730
complete the folder where I am already

524
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,470
now complete myself q  Anything else

525
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,960
in this way you can tell him complete

526
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,159
my other folders glo parent boc history

527
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,950
award this here then the this here at

528
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:08,889
the omitted mainly because the this

529
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:12,250
is seen you do not see so much the selection

530
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,950
so who sparrow is enough to us in the

531
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,440
sense that  he completes a lot because

532
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,269
in my history quite large and

533
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,370
therefore completes many things and with

534
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,840
this I can limit him a bit

535
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,620
so I tell him

536
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:29,080
he removes all do not present

537
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,389
duplicates and the ranch I think is the

538
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:33,490
maximum of the last of the last 10

539
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,870
commands you have  sent nike history

540
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,559
more

541
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,559
here this is the nord patterns so

542
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,509
based on the commands

543
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:49,360
I can choose to ignore the

544
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,090
improvements then the files related to tech the

545
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:56,200
log files because it's the truth you

546
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,539
can't hear it but some binary files I can

547
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:00,220
choose to ignore them because you don't

548
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,990
but he often con vin so I'm interested

549
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,509
that I complete the other things first and

550
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:11,559
then in case the binary files here this is

551
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,960
the exact opposite so here while here

552
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,330
above I put a black list for the

553
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,529
complete ones

554
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:19,450
here instead puts a white list that is

555
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,259
when I complete the complete tar file

556
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:25,330
I am the point by point tgz etcetera

557
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,809
etcetera etcetera

558
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,139
and this is also a real force as

559
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:34,690
I do not know if you have ever happened to do  rm

560
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,529
dir

561
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:38,169
a folder that is not empty in this

562
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:42,250
case he uses globes to say ok with r

563
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,570
me say complete there are folders that

564
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,620
are empty please

565
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,340
and here we have seen more or less everything

566
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,640
then not complex definitions ok

567
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,660
this is also nice

568
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,690
in the sense  that if I want I can tell

569
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,390
sh companies to treat each alias as

570
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,860
a new type of completion i.e.

571
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,030
complete treat me an alias as a

572
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,800
command or so I can

573
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,110
write my computer for my aias but

574
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,510
many times it is not needed so in these

575
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:22,230
lines you can say  use the computer digit

576
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,880
for gi why waste ioria sato gita g

577
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,050
or a sell from a sel function

578
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,180
called mcv use the same will

579
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,960
complete for cd too so this is

580
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,410
the explicit way of  let's tell

581
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,110
him a bit the aliases then the

582
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,140
global aliases just as I told you are git

583
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,530
klomp ergit and while the school aliases

584
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,600
these are the aliases a fix while the

585
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,290
allegro bali are just a couple of their own

586
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,240
ones I mainly use capital g

587
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,820


588
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,840
here you see the no  globe

589
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,610
this is

590
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,640
a hub the sh team that tells me

591
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,620
everything that comes

592
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,240
after this command do not expand the

593
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,670
globe because greek obviously if

594
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,710
you usually put them if you use the asterisk you

595
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,559
do not want to incomplete the names of

596
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,990
the filename for  example ok

597
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
[Music]

598
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:33,570
well you know f zf by chance nobody

599
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,350
knows ftf seriously ok it is a phase

600
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,250


601
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,860
computer basically allows you to do things

602
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,240
like check you know it in the

603
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,460
shell no then if I for example

604
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,620
here then this is this and fz f that

605
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,090
me  search interactively

606
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,309
within my history and then they can

607
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:01,559
select execute my my

608
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,250
serve my command for example these things

609
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:09,870
here now just go rap these

610
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,610
almost things become  or even nicer

611
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,950
in the case of

612
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,359
integrations with gt for example a

613
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:18,100
classic a workflow that often happens to me

614
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,220
is for example I have to damn I have to

615
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,749
comment a I have to comment a

616
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:27,580
fix file a pando a wrong task of

617
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,809
medicated to comment on something

618
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:39,220
ok and I do ok but who is  remember the

619
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,859
shah of the comit then you have two to two

620
00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:46,059
and two options sh you can say there is one that

621
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:47,529
the children who then assign that tells you

622
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:50,019
knock the current command in the

623
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:52,149
next in the next prompt and free me

624
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:54,159
the prompt that I have it  combined with

625
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,509
against the p

626
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:57,519
so now as you see my ready

627
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,080
disappeared what can I do

628
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,609
the blogs go find my

629
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:06,190
comit copy it out and I already have

630
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,379
my command below that was

631
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:11,080
knocked and glued and away but this is

632
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,129
boring so there is a way forever

633
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:18,519
based on zl this here is a plugin and i

634
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:24,570
can do this not really this but

635
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,850
here we are and so this now has not

636
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,650
fired me another command i.e

637
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,120
my my command i am c  omponendo is

638
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,230
still there he is waiting for this is fz

639
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,510
f.col preview and so here I can

640
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,490
search everything within

641
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,120
my g3 pro I can search for

642
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,730
commit message when I find what I

643
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,100
wanted fix appears sending elohim inserts

644
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,310
the show

645
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:08,249
another thing another nice thing that

646
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:10,259
an always another another let's say

647
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:11,549
third h plug in

648
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:13,769
is not official obviously simply

649
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:15,059
other shas that modify its

650
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:17,399
functioning and it is aimed at christ of sap

651
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:20,219
singh source that allows me to search

652
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:22,789
inside  of my history

653
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:24,749
interactively in the sense instead of

654
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:27,330
pressing against the air and searching I can

655
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,859
write mine so and then press I press the up

656
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,719
arrow and he searches for me

657
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,999
all the word shell within

658
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:42,659
all my commands and this is another

659
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:50,029
very plugin  cute as we are in time

660
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,399
obviously like all the like all the

661
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,919
cells allows me to customize

662
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:05,950
my prompt this in truth I had a

663
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,469
lot of customizations but in the

664
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:11,429
end I decided to pass  and on a

665
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,830
whole a plugin let's say already ready

666
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,940
that did more or less everything

667
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,929
I wanted

668
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:21,580
is called power level ten kate and therefore

669
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,669
this here is all configurable but it is very

670
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:27,179
long

671
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:29,799
let's say the variables that if that which are

672
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:32,379
however that already aimed at capri for  of this

673
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:33,429
type of configuration of

674
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:36,309
customizations are prompts but also

675
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:39,159
r prompt that the prompt on the right

676
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:42,219
so you can have as you see here if

677
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:45,129
after more here there is both the prompt on the

678
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,960
left and the r prompt on the right

679
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,359
are automatically spaced let's say ai

680
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:52,210
ai  two sides of the terminal

681
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:59,919
then it is right there is also zz calc ready

682
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,499
sps prompt is the prompt that is used

683
00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:04,779
for when you do a rare spelling and

684
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:06,219
tries to correct you also pollutes

685
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:08,710
the customizable ones while 7 cult

686
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:14,440
prompt is the prompt z calc that the

687
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,869
calculator  integrated within sh

688
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,580
so this with this i can i

689
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,910
can do calculations directly from the

690
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,320
bill team sheath so it is not even

691
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,390
a process invocation so

692
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:31,380
you have it  free let's say

693
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,740
ok

694
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:51,789
well before i had dinner some modules the

695
00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:55,929
modules are binary they are separated from the

696
00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:58,769
core i can insert them with adamo blog

697
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:01,269
some of the modules are pcr so i

698
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:04,269
can have instead of instead of a

699
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:08,429
basic reflex i can use all the

700
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,989
malfunk pcr to use but ethical rhythm

701
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:13,059
floating point have sine cosine and

702
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:16,770
anything else typical zf the client ftp

703
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,059
file that also one thing that among other things

704
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,010
also bash from the water from version

705
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:25,239
4 more maps to me all the current files in

706
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,889
an associative area I can modify to

707
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:28,629
I can access the  file directly as

708
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:31,989
you access both the variable seven

709
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:37,079
folders and this is more or less how much I

710
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,270
have gone a little beyond

711
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,139
this more or less how much if you have

712
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,179
questions ask me I do not know if someone with the

713
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:44,579
microphone

714
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:50,529
here I'm sorry I was a bit chaotic

715
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:53,309
but there really is  so much to see

716
00:34:53,309 --> 00:35:07,420
you can see that on a curiosity and the shah

717
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,339
from before you were talking about that we are

718
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:11,589
looking in the history of kit if it will serve you

719
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:12,670
only as a reference to mentenere

720
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,460
comics and no pr  atically gip allows you

721
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,020
to do these things is called

722
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,559
fix up comments which is practically dc with

723
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,150
this committee I am going to modify

724
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,890
this other comit and then what you do and

725
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,650
make an interactive bass he can

726
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,089
automatically press together

727
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:30,160
ok because the changes and  means they were not

728
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,260
interested no silo changes

729
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,640
mentally I was interested so I

730
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,079
was only interested in pressing that to

731
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,460
take that committee insert it immediately

732
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,390
after the paragraph you wanted to modify then

733
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,470
shell them together in the same comit

734
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:47,490
here is a quick thank you other questions

735
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,940
perfect if you find me around if you have

736
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,770
questions about  bag no problem

737
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,690
I like to talk about it thanks

738
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:03,760
[Applause]
