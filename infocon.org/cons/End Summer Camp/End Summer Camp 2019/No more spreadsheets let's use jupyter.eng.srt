1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,379
let's start therefore let's start from what

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,330
python is a moment let's start from the large

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,250
I suppose that more or less everyone knows

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,420
that we are talking about a programming language

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,170


6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,540
they know the advantages and disadvantages of

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,029
this language

8
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:19,949
first of all the ease with which

9
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,490
a result can be obtained  ease

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,279
with which you can use the large

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:27,869
availability of libraries to

12
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,470
cover all the various sectors of

13
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,369
programming you can go both from

14
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,219
calculation and development of websites up to

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,870
scientific calculation that on which

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,760
I will try a moment to orient

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,010
this thing for that  little that I will talk about

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,930
code the counterpart of this ease

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,550
and lies in the

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,309
ok slowness with which the commands are

21
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,469
executed especially if we write them in

22
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,750
instructions that are not native python or

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,620
native to libraries the interpretation

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,629
on the other hand gives us a fact that  being

25
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,069
looted gives us a great advantage

26
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,770
that being able to execute it line by line

27
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,010
and being able to insert it  ire in a

28
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,580
notebook type framework

29
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,520
now if someone has already used

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,840
math or whatever it's called

31
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,210
but the exact club already has a bit of what it

32
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,830
can be with museums how to make

33
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,090
a notebook basically there

34
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,189
are cells one writes pieces of code

35
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,840
inside  of the cells runs the pieces

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,360
of code one at a time and 10 to

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,869
immediately see the result

38
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:43,409
the notebook par excellence of python

39
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,270
the notebook par excellence of python is

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,109
down peter which is based on a

41
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,950
substantially consists on top

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,750
of another layer that l yesterday  and python

43
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,319
which is a shell for python

44
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,000
now how we install jupiter

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,950
this is the first point i will

46
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,539
touch on having so many libraries python

47
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:06,209
comes with its package manager the

48
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,380
package manager in this case is

49
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,910
called pip when you want to install

50
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,970
software with more on yours  laptop

51
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:22,140
ok the first thing you see that you can

52
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:29,670
go see is that the command is

53
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,049
a pact user been pip and this

54
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:35,670
installs python 2 software

55
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,440
ok this will remain  still valid for a

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,640
few months but let's say that if you

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,680
started playing it from today it is something

58
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,239
to be taken into consideration then with two it

59
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,310
will always die on January 1st 2020

60
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,780
the support of the port stops where

61
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,870
you have to switch to python 3 pip trend you

62
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,900
install software for python three  all

63
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,459
how many commands ending with 3d

64
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,260
usual minutes usually rhymes

65
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,530
parts on python 3 if you use

66
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,000
distributions that follow

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,069
pop standards and now 30 I don't do any

68
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,269
advertising

69
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,459
you already have python 3 by default for a while

70
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,310
now with advantages and disadvantages

71
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,389
consider that many software

72
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:14,099
they still use python 2 and they can't

73
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,690
be they haven't been packaged

74
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,000
for these distributions that follow

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,280
the dead line of the various software a

76
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,319
little bit in advance

77
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,829
now you have to pay attention to

78
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:29,400
this thing as I can install the

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,750
software so I can extract it  maria

80
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,200
free and using pip however can't

81
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,430
install software in

82
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,510
administrator partition you don't have

83
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,920
isn't  root privileges when installing

84
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,110
so if I pip in store something

85
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,340
like jupiter there he gets angry he

86
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,470
downloads the software but blanc is at some

87
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,850
point he gets angry because I could

88
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,020
choose what I say less or less

89
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,120
dependencies is a

90
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,670
full-fledged package manager ok now for mission

91
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,850
denied today at the bottom suggests

92
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,010
strange that the option less less user now

93
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,640
one wanting to learn learned the hard way

94
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,108
can also launch pip with sud

95
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:17,250
where he can go to install the

96
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,970
package directly on the web on

97
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,520
the root folders

98
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,780
what is the problem is this  what

99
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,300
the problem is that the ruby folders

100
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,910
are the same managed by dnf dnf that in

101
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,310
this case of the fedora pact manager

102
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,930
but it also works with the

103
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,840
ubuntu and debian poker manager and you derive what

104
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,600
happens that you give to overwrite with

105
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,080
pip

106
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,060
what  so is installed with your

107
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,790
puckett manager and this breaks everything

108
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,290
especially since pip usually has

109
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,940
much more updated versions of the

110
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,730
software than  those distributed

111
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,560
also if you have a package manager

112
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,940
that wrote in python this

113
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,460
locks you to the computer and increases to

114
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,060
start over

115
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,909
ok this meant

116
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,700
what pip install to this another thing

117
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,750
quite relevant especially for the

118
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,190
sector a bit in which I move that  is

119
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,280
that of hpc and the use of

120
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,870
this type of software on

121
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,870
high performance machines pip install two

122
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,550
installation options that are not

123
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,620
offered to the user in reality he can

124
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,140
compile software in case a bra

125
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,370
recipe to compile it on your

126
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,230
computer  provides him with all the

127
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,340
necessary infrastructure for the

128
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,420
compilation

129
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,850
or he can install a binary on it the

130
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,650
binary is pre-compiled so if you

131
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,640
install it on machines that

132
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,130
have libraries they apologize for the

133
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,610
destruction of more advanced processors

134
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,930
than those that are

135
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,210
normally available compared to those that are

136
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,220
compiled by default

137
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,110
you are losing much of the

138
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,720
performance you might get  and to

139
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,160
give you an idea of what software are

140
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,500
installed using a binary and

141
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,310
what software are installed

142
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,690
using a compile in

143
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,700
runtime let's say if the software

144
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,440
installed in python there is

145
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,990
absolutely nothing strange if instead

146
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,470
where python

147
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,390
if instead software is written  in another

148
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,980
language that is this fantastic site

149
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,060
which is python wheels which

150
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,130
you see from the list is this you do not see very well but here

151
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,950
on the right

152
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,510
here is the list of all the

153
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,760
various software and if the binary versions are available

154
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,110


155
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,310
ok then pip goes  well

156
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,199
one thing can campaign available in

157
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,490
binary version so when you

158
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,319
do nam thai hop sooner instal

159
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,120
another pandas so on

160
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,150
you are not downloading the software and

161
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,530
you compile it for your machine you

162
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,639
are downloading me a person who has been

163
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,800
pre-compiled who is missing  some

164
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,389
instructions that some libraries are missing

165
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:07,720
such as the library for fft or

166
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,039
things like this and the version you

167
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:14,020
will have  so it is slightly here you will have

168
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,460
slightly less performance this does not

169
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,569
change anything if you do it on your

170
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,639
laptop it does not change very little if I

171
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,169
did it on your home work station

172
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:23,729
but if they provide you with a

173
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:25,930
cluster system we say that the

174
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,919
loss is evident

175
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:29,470
ok  i mean you can really measure how much

176
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,400
you are losing in performance

177
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,599
nobody remember what they are called it

178
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,130
would have been interesting that the

179
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,930
inter added these instructions recently

180
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,650
to the av hicks instructions which do a

181
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,449
very nice thing and practically

182
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,960
manage to take a risk to perform

183
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,789
an operation  they are not clock cycle on

184
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:51,669
a whole register so they load the

185
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:52,840
numbers in the front register the operation

186
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,710
in this is something that does not pais fruit

187
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,860
is a nice thing because it comes free

188
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,440
let's say on the ramp it manages matrices

189
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,060
manages directors there is this kind of

190
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,389
thing

191
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,310
ok and if you have an array of numbers

192
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,599
you have to follow the operation on all the

193
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,009
numbers of the rae and I did it and with in c

194
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:13,509
is l  or do with a loop except it takes

195
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:16,750
every number and does it executes the expression in

196
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,039
reality it is taking longer

197
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,849
than executing a single instruction that does

198
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:23,430
the expression on all the numbers

199
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,960
if you do it with a couple it is slightly faster

200
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,030


201
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,599
ok this

202
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,320
so what is the final information

203
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,399
with I have to pass that when you see

204
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,260
installing a software you install it with

205
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,229
less less user at the end using pip

206
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,219
the sum I do it because I already have it

207
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,880
but this installs the software

208
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,070
in the user space

209
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,890
if you want to compile better  otherwise

210
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,300
with this you take it to the user space road the

211
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,850
user space if

212
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,860
someone already has some experience

213
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,029
can see it completely as a

214
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:04,050
virtual environment someone in case

215
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:09,060
this we discuss apart two words that

216
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,040
should be spent in this moment

217
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,450
which is also available online  which is

218
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,390
called fundamentally is

219
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,370
something a bit more complicated than

220
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,290
pip because it says yes managed manage

221
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,350
other languages  also lay

222
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,810
binary packages but not only ship also

223
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,709
libraries and compilers and all included and it

224
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,839
gives you the possibility that this

225
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,279
very interesting thing to have jupiter in

226
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,390
with multi language support

227
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,769
inside a single notebook is a

228
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:43,529
very very nice thing so you can

229
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,089
programming half code in python half

230
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:47,490
in re youtube from him works one thing

231
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,250
that I have never done

232
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,630
but consider that with distracted

233
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,640
anaconda it comes back we go back a little bit

234
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,870
remains the

235
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,110
performance discourse is not irrelevant because

236
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,420
they still snatch binaries ok

237
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,940
or close to their libraries is

238
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,410
another thing that needs to be considered is that

239
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,430
that library must be

240
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,750
compatible with the kernel you are

241
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,390
using so something could be

242
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,740
installed by them and then it

243
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,940
really isn't working is

244
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,880
malfunctioning or crashes same thing

245
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,579
with pip even when main p uil

246
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:19,410
can  it happens that the uil you know is not

247
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,610
compatible with the one they were was

248
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,649
using serve spec  ially if you have

249
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:25,380
very old carnells which in some

250
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,930
sectors unfortunately is at the price of

251
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,290
stability you have to pay also this is

252
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,000
all this does not happen if you have a

253
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,190
good system administrator who

254
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,540
will do things for you then

255
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,100
just ask him guys the heart

256
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,779
can have this  software

257
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,459
install melo compile and you

258
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:49,849
load it download and ok now

259
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,940
suppose you have installed our

260
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,960
jupiter in user how we start it

261
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,820
exists the command more trivial

262
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:14,910
jupiter less less door to door

263
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,730
random default via port 68 88 it seems to me yes

264
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,350
888 badly one already created random on that

265
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,210
door so it would never start

266
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,110
in salerno

267
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,470
because I'm the one because I

268
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,300
never installed jupiter next

269
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,160
step is that the nicest

270
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,320
thing is that after installing jupiter

271
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,120
jupiter offers you a symbol  notebook,

272
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,459
however, there is this other project that

273
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:05,930
in my opinion is just absolutely worth

274
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,459
considering what I will show you

275
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,170
now that at jupit  er lab is a

276
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,500
subproject of jupiter and provides you

277
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,899
with a small

278
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:17,110
development environment much more advanced than

279
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,450
the default one that we are now going to

280
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,800
see then maybe it highlights a couple of

281
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,740
differences the command in

282
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,180
this case you have to install in addition to

283
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,820
jupiter jupiter  lab and the command jupiter

284
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:36,140
lab minus minus port ok are to explain

285
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,410
why

286
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,640
indeed

287
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,920
if standing

288
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,189
ok it doesn't matter

289
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,910
ok

290
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,160
I use it enough so in reality it

291
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,510
launched it pretty really on this

292
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,740
machine because those utilities mind a

293
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,960
service started in systems

294
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,900
of which to this  very nice thing that it

295
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,570
can launch services also in user space

296
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,620
so one can write their own

297
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,360
service files and then when they enter

298
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,910
their session they are automatically

299
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,150
encouraged to this very nice

300
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,170
especially in this case in this

301
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,740
context here

302
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:43,790
when you open it basically it

303
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,959
comes out  such a thing

304
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,639
and this is the interface that opens to you

305
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,149
when you run ju  piter lab on the

306
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:55,879
left you have the folder where you

307
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:58,779
launched it in this case the fom director

308
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:03,829
ok with various

309
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:05,329
here there are various things that you will see

310
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:07,369
with too many a moment later in the

311
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:09,739
center you have various notebooks that is,

312
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:12,049
at the beginning there is none  none but disk

313
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:14,559
are all closed

314
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,079
then you have several nights then what

315
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:22,149
you can do

316
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:23,899
decide the folder where you want to

317
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:26,079
work

318
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:28,519
open a new notebook on this file

319
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,509
on this interface where you can

320
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,100
select the operation you want to do

321
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,049
then the notebook is the standard thing

322
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:35,480
we are going to see  the console is a

323
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,429
working console l3 wind a

324
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:40,639
default python console a console ai start

325
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,119
to be more precise

326
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:45,470
and then there are other other things that

327
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,639
depend on the packages you have

328
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,220
installed because jupiter lab also has a packaging

329
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,559
system inside

330
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,269
that  snatch with various

331
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,259
things

332
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,480
you can avoid text files on each basel

333
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,850
you can write mark down files and there is

334
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,319
this thing that is very nice casa del

335
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:03,379
led conte  manual that can show you the

336
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:04,850
documentation of the functions you are

337
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,209
using

338
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:15,220
when you open a plasma notebook

339
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,480
we open a new one oh well the

340
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,610
default notebook to the title anthai is titled

341
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,100
untitled you can rename it this

342
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,519
is no no problem as

343
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,310
it presents itself with a  fantastic

344
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,910
unnumbered cell on which you can

345
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,639
write many dear things starting

346
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,389
from python the first example is the world ok

347
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:50,980
print at the award ok you can insert

348
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,120
inside the cells of the

349
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,180
markdown code so you can write my

350
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,180
section

351
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,390
here

352
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:17,069
all

353
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,719
here

354
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,100
but with says mark  dame that also supports

355
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:33,280
the display case there is only yes yes if

356
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,600
you have installed this support also

357
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,440
the atac which is very nice and you can

358
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,900
start you can develop a

359
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,490
workflow in quotation marks at least

360
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,300
prototype a workflow

361
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,290
using all these features

362
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,200
and having the  possibility to build it and

363
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,910
write down things you have done and what you

364
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,410
have to do things that you must you will want so

365
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,650
via this notebook with which I had

366
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,340
fun before to insert a bit of

367
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,150
happy reading this corner yes

368
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,819
this notebook with which I had

369
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,280
fun before to go and see

370
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,740
demonstrate with interesting things the

371
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,869
notebook have this fantastic thing

372
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,339
that is the magik notebook have  these

373
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,069
functions but which can be called

374
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:25,150
through the for the am x cent it seems to me

375
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,010
that it is ls magic to get the

376
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,049
whole list but there are really a lot of the

377
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,580
two that in my opinion are most relevant

378
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,130
are those of timing time because they

379
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,570
allow you to understand how much  time it

380
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,820
will take more or less a cell to turn not

381
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,290
in advance in reality they make it run

382
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,669
but if you have to run it on a

383
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:41,410
large data set you can first

384
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,730
run it on a small dataset see

385
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,470
how long it takes and then launch it on a

386
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,000
large data 7 have  the estimate of how

387
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,549
long that cell could run you have

388
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:50,440
the first time that the anxiety to

389
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,260
education once and tells me

390
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,480
how long it took to run  spas

391
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,520
that hold in various times there can be

392
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,540
total time of the wall and so on

393
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,440
this square seems a very

394
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,000
simple thing is this here simply

395
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,250
taken a list hangs a

396
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,770
realistic element under the instruction

397
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,049
time it which is a little more advanced and  which

398
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,640
takes a little longer because it runs

399
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,260
the code a thousand times in reality it

400
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,580
depends on the complexity and the

401
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,470
statistics on the su run

402
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,760
let's say that these here are comfortable

403
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,340
because one can write a function

404
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,080
that analyzes the contents of a file

405
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,450
or things  like this

406
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,309
the head on a file then after the scale on

407
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:35,620
200 300 file knows how long it takes another

408
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,980
interesting thing is what is

409
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,929
printed at below the cell ok because I

410
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:43,750
execute an instruction as I did here

411
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,460
I did print al world  award was

412
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,330
written as we expected below I

413
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,830
can also just insert the string

414
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,350
the result apparently the same in

415
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,990
reality it is not true ok apart from the

416
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,250
quotes that can be seen on the right

417
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,700
left  the internal function of

418
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,020
the string class that has been called is

419
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,350
different ok here is an example of

420
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,910
the example question made on the

421
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,200
list class for those who already know basically

422
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,300
what happens when I use

423
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,830
print I love class a if I call you

424
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,870
the  str method when when he called the

425
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,270
function when I don't call the

426
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,559
print function instead I am using the method the

427
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,920
rapper basically in this case

428
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,300
here I got he defined my list

429
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,830
that his fans

430
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,050
the extension of the class list I

431
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,240
went to override the str method

432
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,030
to do  what ceo wants and

433
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,410
we see that if I take a list l

434
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,179
defined as my list

435
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,280
and she stands for the elements abc

436
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,740
technically the list l contains the

437
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,320
elements abc be I use the rapper method

438
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,880
which is the standard one they are written

439
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,740
as elements of the list while

440
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,360
on the  print method i'm in the net

441
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,920
intercepting political method a above i

442
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,520
'm writing

443
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:03,330
the result of this operation other

444
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,620
things that can be done

445
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,160
inside the notebook is a very nice thing

446
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,270
and the fact that you can run

447
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,510
shell commands directly

448
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,720
in this case here is run pvd ok

449
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,150
as an example is another thing that does

450
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,890
even more advanced is that I can  go

451
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,570
to intercept the result from the

452
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,100
shell commands to be able to script areas then

453
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,440
above in this case then I launched the

454
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,510
ls command I saved the result of

455
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,340
the ls command inside the folder

456
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,930
and inside the variable ah sorry

457
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,250
I am it results and it is a  list

458
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,759


459
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,729
is basically a one line by one element per line

460
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:44,989
of the list this result

461
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:48,479
now all this to contextualize you

462
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:51,269
a bit how you work with jupiter that is

463
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:52,529
how you build a jupiter work environment

464
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:58,649
from scratch more or less but now

465
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:00,329
we are really working on csv  here

466
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:01,889
my verona however a little twisted that

467
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:04,349
those of the stage of

468
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:10,159
the pai data class will do tomorrow in this case here or

469
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,679
let's say ripped off the data from dusk because

470
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,559
because it is of interest it is a framew  ork that

471
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:28,169
extends pandas going to insert

472
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:30,799
what so said she execution

473
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,199
basically you take your

474
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:36,029
operations built an operations graph

475
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,199
with all the

476
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:39,239
dependencies after when it does when you

477
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,229
get to the end you

478
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:41,819
just ask this graph what is the

479
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:43,949
result that you are interested in I manage to

480
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:47,429
decide who is separate from who can

481
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:48,959
perform the operations in parallel and

482
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:51,209
then give me the result making them

483
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,669
computations that require

484
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:54,419
making computations that

485
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:57,709
require that you can to create

486
00:21:57,709 --> 00:22:00,029
a nice framework if you have a

487
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:01,769
cluster on which to run it is someone

488
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:02,879
that you are angry at all because

489
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:04,619
otherwise on a single computer you do not have the

490
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:07,799
consent to use it knows very little if they

491
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,679
are not in reality for various reasons

492
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,509
in this case however I have

493
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:15,569
stopped I downloaded their data on

494
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:23,129
flights from new york from 1990 to 2000 these

495
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:24,650
data are  in

496
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,450
csv hence the title of the talk so if I

497
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,240
now go to the folder I don't

498
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,660
remember  do

499
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,610
of ap

500
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:42,629
the port

501
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:45,879
my father

502
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,889
ok totally it is a v-toilet that one

503
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:57,210
could put by hand could

504
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,399
pass it go could open it

505
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:00,600
easily with any

506
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,929
spreadsheet software could

507
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:05,129
go to do all the various accounts

508
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:07,350
but let's try to elaborate them a

509
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,139
little more  smart and cunning and the

510
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,570
question that I asked myself in order to have

511
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,840
a showcase was to understand

512
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,749
what day of the week in which month

513
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:22,440
we should go to new york

514
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,379
starting from europe based on the

515
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:29,209
media delays accumulated for that month,

516
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:35,909
in short, a small show  weight that was easy

517
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:37,480
then

518
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,950
1 load pandas data is very nice

519
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,730
because it allows us to directly

520
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,220
reload the csv ohrid csv this

521
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,690
function here is very nice for that it

522
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,380
supports a lot of variables actually

523
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,600
in input that is it allows us to read

524
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,660
csv very very complicated and with

525
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,910
doing very very high fur on the type of

526
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,010
variables in this case here it is

527
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,660
also nice to see the help context here is a

528
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,540
thing  what differentiates python from jupiter have

529
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,830
been played by the gip hunter lab that I

530
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,679
can have two notebooks next to

531
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,960
each other and you see that the

532
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,299
contextual I am above csv and

533
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:17,980
has already understood what I'm going to

534
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,840
work they went to sea  and it already gives me

535
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,640
all the documentation to be able to

536
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,049
set the parameters

537
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:24,309
ok which are a more or less

538
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:32,740
infinite list that is to have many this

539
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,720
very easy csv own standard

540
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,950
standard so once we have

541
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,809
loaded we can go and see which

542
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,440
columns it contains in this case here

543
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,710
contains the years months the days

544
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,669
of the year and so on

545
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:50,230
but this has nothing to do with this is right here a

546
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:55,390
display of the data frame if

547
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,040
you ask yourself how I see what

548
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,139
I have loaded I don't think I load here

549
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:06,309
now how I see it jupiter allows us

550
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:08,230
of c from this fantastic interface

551
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,030
where we can see everything at a

552
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,200
glance as if it were a normal

553
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,040
cell system

554
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:23,470
we are very nice other gem

555
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,580
this word of pand  as that can

556
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,020
export the table directly in latex

557
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,470


558
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,420
so once it has been loaded it is

559
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,980
safe to make milk it is

560
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,550
not indifferent

561
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,320
and here a moment to see how you can

562
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,580
still interact with this table I

563
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,250
did the division the grouping by

564
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,830
month  per day and I went to see

565
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,210
the average of her in that day

566
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:54,170
of that month of the week then what

567
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,940
happens here here all rules I read the

568
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,350
business and csv file

569
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,970
at this point it creates a matrix of

570
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,790
zeros months by days of the week

571
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,320
I do an oven cycle and this is a

572
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,610
very nice thing about python that if you

573
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,290
can cycle on several things

574
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,160
at the same time

575
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,070
in this case the data feng the data

576
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,940
frame can group group and group

577
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:28,760
the results automatically as a

578
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,530
askew the assent to the blubike operation

579
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,360
and automatically groups you the system in

580
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,780
di groups the quantities by elements in

581
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,090
this case specified two columns

582
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,980
I wanted to group by month of month

583
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,620
by day  rno by day of the week

584
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,920
then he returns me a skillful iter that

585
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,040
for each next for each connect

586
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,610
returns me 2 quantities one two plus and the

587
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,220
trio data film that has been isolated

588
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,540
by blocking these two the month the day

589
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,610
of the week

590
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,990
on a nice thing that  suit can

591
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,400
be unpacked directly in

592
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,290
the afor lines that is if I know that the first

593
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,240
state of nature that is automatic tell him

594
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,680
look that this must be unpacked in

595
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,020
month and day

596
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,870
and at this point it is necessary to insert the

597
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,880
month to extract the element month day

598
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,190
of the matrix okay I go  to assign

599
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,250


600
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,060
herself in the south extracted thrill date I go to take the array column of her

601
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,890
rival of her and I go to

602
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:30,920
average it this very nice because for who

603
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,050
then later for who should be interested in

604
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,420
this array of her in reality when one

605
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,280
arrives here this defined  panda series

606
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,350
that in reality nothing more than a rapper

607
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,390
around a large array so when

608
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,220
we are here in reality there are large and

609
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,480
everything is much more standard we also say

610
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,280
pe  because automatically fill in the gaps and

611
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,510
the absence of data and once we

612
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,350
created this matrix which

613
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,970
basically contains what we are

614
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,620
interested in I wanted to go the app fight to

615
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,260
give some more to see some

616
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,280
things that can be done

617
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,430
then or imported  the most commonly used book and

618
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,230
standard library most

619
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,060
commonly used to fight that but

620
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,480
plot league

621
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,910
this string is a nice thing if

622
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,920
someone already uses ma cloth libe know

623
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,080
that they can always

624
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,410
immediately set the

625
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,310
characteristics with which they want to do they

626
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,930
want to go to do as a first approximation  the plot in this

627
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,250
case here I automatically skipped the

628
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,060
font and the fim eyes since it is in line

629
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,940
more or less what someone was always on

630
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,920
line is the result is proposed

631
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,780
in the cell ok transposed the matrix at

632
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,220
this point 1 creates a create  a figure

633
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,130
we skip this which is rather boring

634
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:50,460
then if someone interested it can

635
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,570
go to travesti when in shooting

636
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,230
through and this is the

637
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,840
pilot matrix  ta with minutes late in a

638
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,900
blue and dark blue color are

639
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,730
even early light yellow are very

640
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,420
late and we have the months of the year

641
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,160
horizontally vertically we have the

642
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,550
days of the week

643
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,960
here

644
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,000
more to conclude what I wanted

645
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,260
to show you for a moment was

646
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,730
all the stack that one must have to

647
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,799
be able to develop to be able to use

648
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,139
jupiter in a meaningful way in quotation marks

649
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:38,639
without big performance gains without

650
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:43,269
big problems let's say during the

651
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:47,429
installation phase and then after going to

652
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,529
see for a moment how it was used and how

653
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,450
it was  in this small context they can deal with

654
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,870
simple panda data frames

655
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,909
on which they will continue tomorrow no more

656
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:02,490
questions

657
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:10,749
[Applause]
