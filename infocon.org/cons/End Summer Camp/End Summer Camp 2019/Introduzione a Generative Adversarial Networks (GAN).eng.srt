1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
hi i am sebastian biol i am

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,250
an ip student i am in the first year

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,519
of computer science and today i am here to

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,370
explain you genetics where history network

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,330
obliged in gun and i will explain what it

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,400
is how it works and some

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,890
applications of s very briefly

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,849
however it is what it is  'is gun then gun is

9
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:28,619
a neural architecture composed of two

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,488
networks competing with each other is an

11
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,040
anso-type algorithm for vice it

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,210
means that it does not need to know in

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,430
advance if the output it produced

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,480
is not right or right or  no and

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,930
thanks to this his feature he

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:56,579
manages to mimic learning to any

17
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,039
data distribution so not

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,320
only images but also audio and video

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,650
how it works then we have a note

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,740
these two beds one the generator and

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,500
the other describe nator the generator takes

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,860
care  to generate an image that must

23
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,240
increasingly resemble the training

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,909
set of the images present in the trains

25
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,030
set but not exactly the same while the

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,450
discrimine tor e will have the task of

27
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,030
conf  addressing the image of the train set is

28
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,270
the image that generated the regenerator and

29
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,509
deciding if this image is

30
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,579
similar enough or not to that of the training

31
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,509
set and we continue this way until the

32
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,409
gene rite fails to generate

33
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,770
an image similar enough to the  37 but

34
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,020
not the same by updating the various parameters

35
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:58,350
this is an example of

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,920
resnais architecture gun architectures and is called

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,250
srl snet abbreviated to super resolution

38
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,050
and snack just as I said there is

39
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,390
the generator part is the

40
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:18,780
discriminators part and that the generators

41
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,150
input a

42
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,879
random and usually gigantist array

43
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,709
128 of completely random values and

44
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,599
which are then used to generate

45
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,239
the image and the total number of her

46
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,640
ball that you can pour the balls as

47
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,170
to the various types of animals for

48
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,120
example dog and  cat after etc.

49
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,769
in this case we have 34 from here it

50
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,750
generates an image of size 128 x

51
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,200
128 it passes it through the whole network

52
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,489
especially in these sixteen rendered by the

53
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,299
blog c  he are precisely the characteristics

54
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:03,269
of re snet up to the end

55
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,970
that outputs an image

56
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,319
128 x 128 in this case we have this

57
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,030
size but it could also be 200

58
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,470
106 x 256 or so on so the discrimine tor

59
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,319
takes the image well in input  of the

60
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,439
generator started before it passes it

61
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,900
through all for all layers for all

62
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,370
these layers to make a

63
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,120
1024 x 1 large image from here returns an array

64
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,019
establishes both this image and

65
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:39,720
how much it thinks that these images

66
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,940
belong to specific apple counts if

67
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,319
we have a root of  34 gable

68
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,269
returns value between 0 and 1 of how

69
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,459
safe it is that ball 16

70
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,769
completely safe and zero means

71
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,209
it thinks it is not of those ball

72
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:00,180
various applications of gan are

73
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,359


74
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,620
for example creating images of

75
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,340
celebrities that look like celebrities

76
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,840
but the truth are not really these people do not really

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,390
exist or

78
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,940
as I said before with the architecture

79
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,579
that we have been before the mig  lioramento

80
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,570
from a low quality image to high

81
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,410
quality or even the transformation of

82
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,940
domains between for example a horse and a

83
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,260
zebra the

84
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,750
characteristics of the two are swapped and to make

85
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,700
a zebra horse look like a zebra zebra a

86
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,650
horse but deceives the coordination of

87
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,900
development algorithms are created  new

88
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,150
and is also used for the segmentation

89
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,560
of images or obstacles to the stopover of

90
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,419
images and but the application that

91
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,510
caused the most stir with this

92
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,190
car was the creation of

93
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,560
anime and manga characters on kong ann

94
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,539
emitted in the shower in dt lium e  they are

95
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:12,450
just exchanged and sold between

96
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,180
people through smart contracts so that

97
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,090
they know them and emilia has managed to

98
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,470
create a real business

99
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,820
only with these there is this

100
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,930
sale of images of souls and it is an idea

101
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,850
similar to crypto chitis for  so he

102
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,520
knew if you want for other

103
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,810
formations there is on creep cry stage dowry

104
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,060
to the in which they explain their project

105
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,010
so interested by their idea I

106
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,919
said  or I thought of trying to simulate

107
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,750
what they did what

108
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,680
they did and then I

109
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,970
also created my own rap where I created images of

110
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,240
anime characters and I wrote it in

111
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,000
python using the python framework if you

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,280
are interested this here the

113
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,080
detailed link  with also other various examples

114
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,659
here I show you how some some

115
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:20,240
results that the whole generation has obtained

116
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,750
and some are some

117
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,539
results are all good others no

118
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:29,780
I still have to work on it but in the meantime it is a

119
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,789
start this is all

120
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,930
I have finished the if you have questions

121
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:48,690
[  Applause]

122
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,690
no one

123
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:56,120
sorry

124
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,940
once the lace

125
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,780
for the audio that applications are

126
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,070
typical now I have no idea

127
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,560
but surely there are architecture

128
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,770
placed to generate audio for example I have

129
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,200
seen many applications that took

130
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,310
with a dataset

131
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,630
beethoven bach mozart piano songs and reproduced  a

132
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,610
completely new dougan mentored song

133
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,890
but also listenable too let's

134
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,930
just say clearly it's still not perfect

135
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,020
when it was  delegate we have seen that they

136
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,200
work by having a reference data

137
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,580
and pressing two networks that try to 1

138
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,230
point to simulate the vate the reference

139
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,870
the other to distinguish them singh extract

140
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,000
example of allocating figures it is

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,350
clear what the reference data are

142
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,680
and what is the result  for you are

143
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,810
transferring how it works when we

144
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,520
can also say this is a data set

145
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,520
where I transformed zebras with the

146
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,050
style of I don't know of this

147
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,780
picasso painters to say you know good chance how they

148
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,080
did just auser the

149
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,620
reference dataset for los ai  trans if I have

150
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,290
studied 6 transfers but I have not studied it

151
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,510
with gun so I do not know if there is I

152
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,030
would not be able to report the point with gun

153
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,700
how it works but I think the idea is always

154
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,770
the same at the end of having two networks

155
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,479
that compete with them for  generate

156
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,890
an image and I don't really know what

157
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,700
changes in the network layer nurseries there

158
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,230
are still paper lictors

159
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,270
safely on the internet

160
00:08:52,270 --> 00:09:00,130
I don't know how to answer you true other

161
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,339
questions

162
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,579
thanks  and listening
