1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
good morning I came here to

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,029
be a cook and therefore I am in uniform

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,230
since there is a free window and

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,300
since it happened to me talking to

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,519
how many people here to discover that

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,010
my way of doing things is not very

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,070
understood very widespread did not represent

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,920
a  thing that I had presented in December

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,840
of 2018

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,670
what a bad thing you can from behind

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,740
because there is no shadow to indicate you

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,340
present it in one in another conference

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,860
is the idea was let's see how that are the

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,710
things that I professionally do you can

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,510
do a hardware and

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,980
software project together with some attentions

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,989
that I see that many of my colleagues

18
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,920
are not followed so we create a time to

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,390
digital

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,550
converter I apologize if we lay the only in

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,960
English but we know that we are a

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,850
colony and therefore we are forced to do

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,129
these things

24
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,110
the digital converter time is a

25
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,409
device that returns on some

26
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,950
channel the time stamp of a

27
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,049
rising or falling edge of a signal for

28
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,500
example white rabbit  which is a program

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,280
that I followed at cern a I worked with

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,560
them for a few years

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,560
and yesterday I had the t-shirt the

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,939
fake white rabbit t-shirt cave the

33
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,130
playboy bunny instead of

34
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,079
this stamp here

35
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,829
a project that distributes the

36
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:40,909
absolute time from atomic clocks

37
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:45,570
associated with the gps and takes it

38
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,880
through gigabit switches at 18 port

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,140
takes it to different actuator nodes these

40
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,439
things here for example if one has to make an

41
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,020
oscilloscope distributed on the lhc the

42
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,159
large hadron collider that 27 km

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,369
needs all the machines to be

44
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:06,689
synchronized because

45
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,970
Precise oscilloscopes with 27 kilometers long probes

46
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,100
are not found around

47
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,880
and so these for example

48
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,510
are typical

49
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,060
so this is a card that is pci

50
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,820
express with a modulus that does the typical

51
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,880
this is away me because most

52
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,250
of the industrial series machines  of

53
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,940
the scientific laboratories are away me and

54
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,690
they time stamp the impulses of the

55
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,740
inputs with precision of ten peak

56
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,530
seconds with one  resolution of 10

57
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,950
picoseconds and an absolute accuracy of

58
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,280
150 pico 10 epic only 2 mm

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,800
of signal propagation time up on the cable

60
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,420
so there was also a whole run

61
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,620
length calibration phase

62
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,590
this kind of weird stuff a real use case

63
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,410
is this this is this is

64
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,250
the experiment of the triune good of the great

65
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,790
stone

66
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,980
what no one has heard about

67
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,380
because here we have shown that the

68
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,210
neutrinos really went at the

69
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,080
speed of light but it is not news

70
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,870
so no one has spoken

71
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,710
what we have done is have  a

72
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,390
gps plus all odg atomic cesium

73
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,600
attached to the terms switch that carried

74
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,810
the time with another suite in the gallery

75
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,530
where the experiment

76
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,090
that the icarus experiment and all the

77
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,580
others is actually carried out and outside there was this

78
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,410
machine here that received  212 will receive

79
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,870
a square wave and did the time stamp

80
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,570
both with the local time and with the time

81
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,190
that entered the tunnel came back

82
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,580


83
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,470
out because it always had a

84
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,290
s  self test system to verify

85
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,320
that things are working I

86
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,180
confess that a year a year and a half

87
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,050
after the experiment I did ssh on the

88
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,200
machine and the time stamps of the square wave

89
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,140
were given home [ __ ] you can not say

90
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,529
to the limit you cut

91
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,410
the recording but since  during the

92
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,870
whole experiment the time stamps of the

93
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,000
same square wave seen with two different

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,970
times were precise it means that the

95
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,310
measurement made in the gallery

96
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,280
was fine I apologize if I stutter

97
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,290
but I was not designed to speak

98
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,550
in public this is something that happened to me

99
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,910
after

100
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,770
then this means that you have

101
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,540
never heard me because I always say it with the

102
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,840
old joke anyway so this is what

103
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,000
we do now for fun to

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,330
show to show how

105
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,700
hardware and software are designed and together this a

106
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,500
project made especially for this

107
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,750
conference  it says in c but it is a case

108
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,150
that it costs about 10 euros ship a

109
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,580
handful to give to the public now

110
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,169
he has not brought them because I did not think they were

111
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:19,950
there  if a free slot is something that gps

112
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,400
disciplined gps what does it mean it

113
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,070
means that I have set up an entrance in

114
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,070
which I see the time for the even if with

115
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,590
the impulse of the beginning of each second

116
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,140
by the gps and then

117
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,229
I simply do  pretend to say I'm ok this is

118
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:40,950
connected with usb or co or with the

119
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,450
serial port to tell the timing of the

120
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,120
input pulses so this here is the

121
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,010
circuit this is the schematic and

122
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,200
that down there is the circuit of

123
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,930
course we have a microcontroller

124
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,690
with the  'power supply and with it

125
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,070
sb we add the you tell this

126
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,640
10-pin plug in which we have

127
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,229
power ground and eight inputs in

128
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:12,350
which we are going to do the test stamp

129
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,700
inputs are those that are brought

130
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,370
to these feet on this side of the

131
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,830
microcontroller then we add

132
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,229
the power supply to  12 volts because you

133
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,130
never know if one is not 5 times but at 12 it is

134
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,870
always convenient

135
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,250
we add next next is an octine spin

136
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,340
invented by the imex is a 10 poles

137
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,409
of those that cost nothing like that  lli that

138
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,000
if one has old computers he can

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,890
disassemble the piece of flat cable with the

140
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,979
ten poles because it was always inside

141
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:45,900
that brings out all the

142
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,510
data acquisition devices the serial ii quad oc

143
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,320
is the spy and of course obviously

144
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,830
I say it of

145
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,349
course this  part of brad board

146
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:58,919
this this one a bit of a thousand holes

147
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,570
why not because there was

148
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,990
free space what is missing then a corrector

149
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,840
threw jtag plug that that 20 poles on

150
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,720


151
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,370
the side why not debugging if one

152
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,510
wants to experiment with

153
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,540
but cd  or with some ata stuff why not

154
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,180
then since there is space

155
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,310
that in now flash put that one I want to

156
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,080
add saving of

157
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,710
the impulse history etcetera and one is pro

158
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,110
because there is ccee framework there is ready at

159
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,550
12 cents

160
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,700
because it will not put to the limit  a steady and

161
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,460
then of course the diagnostic LEDs

162
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,590
what is missing at this point some

163
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,690
oscillators for the right car these

164
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,060
are two oscillators on the air here

165
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,430
because it is a good thing that every system

166
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,670
has  on board the mechanisms to do

167
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,370
the self-test then it is clear that if I

168
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,560
produce this industrially I

169
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,050
do not have the oscillators mounted in

170
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,060
my world I at home to

171
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,130
debug to play the firmware I mount them

172
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,650
I work in production no but it is

173
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,690
really a  led big go and

174
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,490
take a separate oscillator on a thousand photos

175
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,530
to test to create

176
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,230
impulses for this crap of things

177
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,660
so something that tends to do

178
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,610
seems just a minimum of space I have no

179
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,410
mechanical constraints plus too big a

180
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,750
put it looks like a self test system  in

181
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,990
this case and the oscillators come out

182
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,870
on two pins so like a wire it

183
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,089
connects them to my inputs and then either

184
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:36,339
directly a square wave of which

185
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:38,169
I do the times time actually

186
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,940
I see that it works and then why not a

187
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,720
neighbor who is the vc that is  a volt ed

188
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,660
controlled crystal bed is the one

189
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,839
scillato re for example from 10 May

190
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,770
but which has a voltage input that

191
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,420
allows you to say go a little louder go

192
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,170
a little more  slowly

193
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,390
this is what we also have in

194
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,580
the cern machines and the white rabbits on

195
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,650
hitler but they foresee from what it

196
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,750
allows once we are

197
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,520
going too fast or too slow to

198
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,140
adjust the frequency in order to

199
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,540
be sure that we go at the

200
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,970
right speeds this because  according to the work

201
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,400
with the cern machine

202
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,040
I always have to apply my patch to

203
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,080
disable the slay functionality of the

204
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,180
atomic clock because I have not

205
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,420
worked atomic at home 40 thousand euros and

206
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,060
then I said why to put a

207
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,460
nice 11 cso footprint since  there is

208
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,670
space on mine instead of

209
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,160
mounting the 12 mag and disassembling the 10 mag

210
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,320
he mounted the duck and then I can

211
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,250
simulate being an atomic clock or

212
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,500
the two outputs on the 10 mag her face bus per

213
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,320
second which then bis switch allow you

214
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,520
to  i say ios

215
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,590
i mean real time i am attached

216
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,560
to a gps atomic clock instead of 40

217
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,380
thousand euros they make 10 and obviously eight

218
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,140
days man to write the code but

219
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,850
another thing  this then this is

220
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,970
played printed

221
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,910
what is still missing in your opinion there is no

222
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,430
ball all this is put a bunch of

223
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,620
stuff that is completely on berto in

224
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,420
truth makalu cable some things missing the

225
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:25,130
name the name and the date the month it takes

226
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:29,090
of the day not  what is missing for a long

227
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:33,570
time then missing the

228
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,770
labels for the serial number and the

229
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,570
type of processor are missing since the

230
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,840
seller in this case the nxp of

231
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,350
these micro there are many similar ones I

232
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,240
rather can choose to save

233
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,530
one and if to go to another and then

234
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,960
this  small window here

235
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,210
allows me to write what I have mounted

236
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,780
above the serial number a cool and

237
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,090
some colleagues said it's nice I

238
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,010
put it there too it makes a nice rectangle nor

239
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,010
white 48 mm depending on how far it

240
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,880
is and writes the serial on it  number

241
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,990
because if you don't put them in the

242
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,660
blanks surely on the back of the pcb

243
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,580
he wrote us the number with a marker but it's

244
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,590
not professional it sucks

245
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,600
so let's put the number we don't

246
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,150
care the number  ro is because when I text them

247
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,370
I know that the number 12 there is a problem here

248
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,140
the number 20 and flavors alarms I do

249
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,480
text files or if I am looking at a

250
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,220
spreadsheet personally

251
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,029
I am not modern so I know about everyone

252
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,920
when that is the core everyone is not

253
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,350
that I am always who is assembled well and who is

254
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,779
bad so this way and there is great

255
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,920
amber is written well what is missing then

256
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,829
the signature is missing

257
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:50,220
I do this vice I put a ruby

258
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,170
school psi in the corner

259
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,660
because I like to vote for vintage books

260
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,839
when I ship  bookshop take the

261
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,459
translations of the mach said for example by

262
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:04,199
guglielmo shakespeare that there were the

263
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:10,139
engravings of di di gustavo dorè and it says

264
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,199
g d'ora the killed I like a

265
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,209
mess then even if the name I

266
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:18,089
usually put under here is  the name of the

267
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:20,639
client in the corner I always put

268
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,300
a ruby school psi my son

269
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,279
raw saw it he said cool when I am

270
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,470
a civil engineer in the corner of the bridges

271
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,629
I will write to us today rubini school psi

272
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:33,360
because it is [ __ ] but we have it

273
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,040
done c  i'm done by work it seems to me a

274
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,079
nice project it is fair that if someone

275
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,329
opens the plastic box see who it is

276
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:41,689
who designed the [ __ ] thing but

277
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:46,189
why did they put it at this point

278
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:48,930
what is it that is needed

279
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,230
what is that you learn from this

280
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,589
long [ __ ]  then cutting

281
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,300
an important thing is to use some nice

282
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,730
numbers for the mechanical part I

283
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,950
didn't show it at the beginning there is a slide but

284
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,480
from here to which there are exactly 5 mm

285
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,130
not 5.15 2505 usually the holes I put them

286
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,960
after  but I always try to put on

287
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,300
a grid that is a multiple of 5 mm

288
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,520
because the mechanic who

289
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,370
has to make the box after meters is there with the caliber

290
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,800
say but I don't understand look it's a multiple

291
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,770
of 5 don't worry sure

292
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,530
another thing to put all the holes  of the

293
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,720
pin streep on the 100 thousand grid

294
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,440
that is from two widows 54 mm because the good

295
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,600
maximum banzi as cool as he is

296
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,060
crazy because he put a pin

297
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,700
shifted by 1.27

298
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,410
he says why they are so Chinese they do not

299
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,180
copy it but when ever

300
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,000
why so sell them  shi  eld because

301
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,770
I have in a thousand out and put in mine

302
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,660
for the fetuses apple and etc. I cannot

303
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,700
put myself in the holes on the arduino because there is

304
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,790
the integrated half step so since

305
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,470
I obviously for all my cards

306
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,890
do the head card nor balance  one

307
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,780
all the holes must be on a

308
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,570
multiple of 2.54 this is very

309
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,300
important

310
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,040
obviously add things all the

311
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,350
flashes the apple because knox the

312
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,800
free space obviously put the

313
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,970
diagnostic LEDs a flash for the store and will

314
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,880
accept it and as I said the oscillators

315
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,640
because  you have to put a head set

316
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,290
inside there is the board itself

317
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,100
ok this point and software how

318
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,590
we do it in software in this case

319
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,440
as each seller

320
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,170
usually offers a family they are very much in use

321
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,010
the stm32 I admit it I genuflette tommy

322
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,920
trento not yet studied  my

323
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,870
codebase does not support stm32 yet

324
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,550
but luckily a client who

325
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,410
asked me for a project on stm 32 so there

326
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,680
where to learn rico way to have to

327
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,170
study  has passed an exam or even a

328
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,820
customer who does not pay you if

329
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,790
the work does not work in this case I used

330
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,779
as

331
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:04,480
with the npc that is this family that I

332
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,290
like a lot

333
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,439
I lost the mouse ave the same are

334
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:13,360
decorated m0 and and m3 and the thing  nice

335
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,300
respect lardino that I recommend 18 ben di

336
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,800
[ __ ] it is clear beautiful the ideas

337
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,809
that made everything beautiful but

338
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:26,860
[ __ ] b with arduino costs much more than

339
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,529
this than 32-bit what happens that I have

340
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,949
32-bit timers with a 32-bit pre scale

341
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:33,339


342
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,529
this means that if I want a

343
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:37,959
millisecond counter I don't have to

344
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,519
put an interruption

345
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,309
just that it binds as machine log and

346
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,519
if I want a microsecond counter

347
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,189
sky for free just put the pre

348
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:51,189
scalera 48 is a

349
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:54,930
microsecond counter without interruptions

350
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,829
so this case we use blue  24 but it

351
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:02,980
is also possible to notice others

352
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,389
this I wrote because the ones I gave

353
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:07,079
to the public contained this framework

354
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:12,970
so the software choices must

355
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,129
obviously be first written  re soft

356
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:18,309
understand our use case

357
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:21,759
obviously sporadic events are

358
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,649
easier to manage

359
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,139
what is a sporadic event than

360
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:30,160
what happens infrequently if me or a square wave

361
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,910


362
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,259
the event is not sporadic is periodic

363
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,120
when the sensor of the  neutrino tells me

364
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,149
well he doesn't becca he said [ __ ] but because

365
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:43,420
a neutrino arrived at that point from

366
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,579
sporadic to me it happens after 4 minutes

367
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:49,449
in the garments from another etc. from this it is

368
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:52,179
easier to manage because because I can

369
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,300
go and do a tight sampling

370
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,850
on my feet  and then when

371
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,309
I print the time even if I don't sample for a while

372
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:01,990
who cares so much I know that this

373
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,140
event is sporadic obviously

374
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,439
purely random events are more difficult

375
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:10,990
because I cannot stop sampling

376
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,099
while I print

377
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,650
and therefore of course there is a need for a

378
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,880
bar because company

379
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,419
not only do we need to be able to

380
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:22,240
measure bad performance because

381
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,240
if my system brings me back to 220

382
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,740
near 220 almost immediate I need to

383
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,340
know if I know that for  print the

384
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,980
message it takes 10 microseconds

385
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,830
I am leaving that and I do not measure in

386
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,220
some way that I will never be able

387
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,919
to accurately report two events closer than

388
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,549
10 microns knew it before if my

389
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:51,250
stream says they are 10 it could

390
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,470
be 543 I don't know I have to  be sure

391
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,200
and of course you also have to say how

392
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,820
good the time stamp is

393
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,549
ok but these are my software choices

394
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:09,220
this is stuff that has grown over

395
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,200
time

396
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,409
and that I have published only when there is

397
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:17,169
the conference here as timer state

398
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:21,570
machine os dot  gate and the choices are

399
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,399
no interruption his switch

400
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:28,269
because because if now interrupts

401
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:30,730
I sometimes need to disable them

402
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,220
because I am trying a strip of neo

403
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,779
pixel which was a need for precise timing

404
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:36,130


405
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,260
then if starting I say they are without

406
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,100
interruptions there is no problem

407
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,649
the  forum hours is self contained when the

408
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:46,779
vendor tells me a in stables clips you

409
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:48,340
install these libraries is at the cash desk

410
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,529
i funny accepts and when it does not work i

411
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,389
do  you say external employees with

412
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:53,950
versions etc. Marco's group so

413
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,549
I keep everything self contained a

414
00:18:57,549 --> 00:18:59,559
project I did five years ago is

415
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,039
called tos to our operating system in

416
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,250
which I put myself here and write operating

417
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,679
from scratch in the external employee school is

418
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:10,179
enough for me  mei that compiler new

419
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:15,269
may but that's okay too woe to prefer to

420
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:17,880
prefer data over code

421
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,350
this has always been told to me it

422
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,590
took me 30 years to understand it is true if 1

423
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,269
imposed on the dates below the code is

424
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:27,100
free if one starts to write  the

425
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,200
code comes out crazy do everything as

426
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,809
auction machines defined then every pocket

427
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:37,600
every little thing every rob I do what it

428
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,820
does has its state that no

429
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,370
data structure is called does 4 [ __ ] places

430
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,860
all machine states this simplifies

431
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,549
monstrously other stuff the

432
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:50,860
eflow sections  unstoppably linux to

433
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,039
make vectors at compile time and

434
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,740
company obviously you can

435
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,769
disagree I confess that this year in

436
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:02,559
addition to  take the exam 32 I will

437
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,029
also have to add the interruptions for

438
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:06,370
some cases really one cannot do

439
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,539
without but

440
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,480
the basic idea is still questionable

441
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,519
but it works or a certain number of

442
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:15,370
real industrial production projects

443
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,919
working with this mechanism

444
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,620
among other things yes  attack a de bakker

445
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,690
it is not that the problem that there is

446
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,640
something else must work is all

447
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,100
you are made so I can do

448
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,150
things without any kind of problem

449
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:33,510
so for the ttc there is a need to create

450
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,910
a communication protocol

451
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,670
currently the  protocol and hashish

452
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,530
because you quit because I want to bind it to

453
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,220
an ascii file there is a need for strange things

454
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,410
and at the end the code is just

455
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,080
this so I look at the bit mask of

456
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,750
the pins if it is the same as before there is

457
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,190
nothing to do when reentering  already had to

458
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,280
print as mold mold based on

459
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,080
16 that way there

460
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,510
fine so now there should be

461
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,179
a demo but it was an hour and a half in the

462
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:10,679
whole program that the blast ski

463
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:13,140
to show that the  my executable gave the

464
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,880
same response as the oscilloscope to

465
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,740
see that things work

466
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,929
anyway in this case we have the

467
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:24,990
bad performance as the

468
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,790
bad performance I see because I have a foot

469
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,880
of the bug this here that

470
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,700
I am going to jump here and the low one

471
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,940
since  at this juncture

472
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,950
of time I am not sampling because I am

473
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,710
printing I have a foot for which they

474
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,480
stick to it and I discover that I am not

475
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,320
sampling for what it was for two

476
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,250
thousandths

477
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,920
I know so automatically I immediately say

478
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,080
ok my system can give me a

479
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,900
distance between impulses no shorter than 2

480
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,470
thousandths

481
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,400
the speech before the dl know

482
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,660
your limits

483
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,670
at this point of course I can

484
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,970
add a buffer so

485
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,480
let's go to the pole on

486
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,010
the 10 months so what happens is

487
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:19,840
that I have a buffer of 63  samples if I

488
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,200
can't print I don't print I look the

489
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,140
result that I have a mafia latency of

490
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,510
131 micro always seen with the

491
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,710
therapy foot of not really needed to  this

492
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,830
thing i am 103 don mico print f la s pro

493
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,510
in the head in which I print based on if disk

494
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,220
per cent right etc. is what

495
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,220
I ask me who asks me more time how can

496
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,700
I do the thing better apart than

497
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,530
transmit in binary rather than in

498
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,570
ascii code there is someone who has

499
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,260
suggestions in the room what a sad thing

500
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,429
unfortunately it pronounces time we cannot

501
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:55,960
wait for you to think about it

502
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,400
the solution is to make a defined house

503
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,040
so the point f I have made it

504
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,340
become something that every time I print on

505
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,270
by  therefore having the base xvi must have the

506
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,720
separators is a data structure the

507
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,600
data structure that tells me for each

508
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,000
point of the string if I have to

509
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,980
convert based on 16 or put a

510
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,580
separator in this way the time the

511
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,450
minimum sampling time becomes

512
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,290
4.88 micro  from 131 it is not bad always

513
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,270
machine states but that had been and

514
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,820
data structure set right the

515
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,010
data structure the code comes free it

516
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,110
comes automatically so this way

517
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,570
we can do a demo let's see u  n some

518
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,890
stuff there are these beautiful

519
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,100
instructions assemble the end and r which

520
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,780
allow methods to do a loop but

521
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,460
there is another problem about this

522
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,970
immigrant also on the stm32 the

523
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,429
flash access cannot be as fast as the

524
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:05,950
micro in this case  the micro goes to 48

525
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,919
makers but the flash access goes to 16

526
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:11,320
so if I go to 12 or a clock cycle

527
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,700
for instruction if I go to 48 every now

528
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,130
and then it stops every now and then the teacher

529
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,320
takes two cycles the kanepi how

530
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,159
we do then

531
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,619
this  we do going to create

532
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:28,299
that help section drumcode us nine no

533
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:32,619
retrone cetera and at this point what

534
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:34,090
happens my piece of

535
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,519
critical code after all the ideas to act in

536
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,029
round

537
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:39,489
so or a clock cycle for

538
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:41,889
machine instruction this seems strange

539
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:45,489
on the cassata is of the gcc is

540
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:47,950
I learned it beautiful by studying the linux code

541
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,869
learn a lot about the linux code

542
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:52,359
if it seems too difficult linux lab

543
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,340
that today the big companies drive it

544
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,379
no longer pilots it so take it

545
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:58,629
a 56 years ago linux found a

546
00:24:58,629 --> 00:25:00,489
lot of beautiful things and not too much

547
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:03,580
code as it happens today

548
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,830
and at this point we find that we have a

549
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,529
little less than two micro but in any case the

550
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:13,450
transmission time on the look at the

551
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,190
physical time that we bend of the

552
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:20,080
package is of  2 thousandths for which we

553
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,970
can do it

554
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,859
pulses shortens the format we can

555
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:25,720
make

556
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,450
the serial port go faster or if our

557
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,970
use case and that of neutrinos we can

558
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,099
only send the rising edge because

559
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,769
the previous code instead sends both the

560
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:39,340
bottom in  both the rising edge and the falling edge

561
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,859
then I add a k config to the binary

562
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:44,200
in truth the system is already with k con

563
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,669
fig and choose the type of processor

564
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:51,460
etc. so that one a of the eiff but

565
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,590
not a of the eiff while the code runs

566
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,379
each it  it costs 23 machine instructions

567
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:59,409
but it's a constant condition in

568
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:01,679
compilation so it doesn't

569
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,970
degrade performance but we can create

570
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,889
binaries for a use case and binaries

571
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:09,220
for that other demo that doesn't exist

572
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:09,729
we have it

573
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:13,239
you can think of switching to sb you

574
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,509
can think of doing a lot of things and

575
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:18,609
obviously you can think of converting

576
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:21,190
the time stamps from those of micheletto to

577
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,309
absolute ones like with gps

578
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:26,109
obviously to do the demo what he

579
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:27,909
did not  a tonic clock and

580
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:30,339
another coupon of these in which the

581
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,259
foot of the pool for centuries instead of

582
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,269
being an input of the nagpur or another

583
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:36,669
binary that generates an output simulator for me,

584
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:43,149
all this filth is finished

585
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:45,669
and published on bit lab in

586
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:46,989
truth it has  I also put sauces tab

587
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:48,970
because then everyone is looking for me only immediately

588
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,519
to a life I bought microsoft but

589
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,169
it is not bad but it is not even good and

590
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:58,289
nothing and this is me of

591
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:04,330
course to vent my

592
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,399
technological failures I have fun in the

593
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:08,379
kitchen and I feed 50

594
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:11,529
unfortunate people here unfortunately or fortunately

595
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,710
they think about it but a little more game

596
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,210
Sunday lunch take off risotto class

597
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,849
ml because it stops but only 50

598
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:21,789
if you are more you eat less  so

599
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:23,769
this that the b-side of my

600
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,720
business card serves to show customers

601
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,239
that I really am a gun because I

602
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:31,559
give them the sbrisolona with the guttalax of

603
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,460
course I always have to explain to them

604
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,679
that I am not sending to [ __ ] the

605
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,299
specific customer but the idea is me  I share the

606
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:42,009
knowledge because I am a

607
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:44,070
free software so this is

608
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,989
sterile information this is knowledge and it

609
00:27:46,989 --> 00:27:49,299
allows you to eat when a

610
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:51,729
link you have made it and very good but

611
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:54,279
I eat a mata army is a

612
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,139
gun if you put the duets of that

613
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:58,089
of the  'other clear that then comes a kilo it

614
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:00,009
is clear that I do not eat it in 41

615
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:02,649
sbrisolona amanda in ten but you understand

616
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:05,370
if it does not count if you do not look at the

617
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,160
numbers that I give you let's say gun

618
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,270
even if for a

619
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,820
good technician thank you for your attention I

620
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,650
started 5 minutes late

621
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,360
finished 3 minutes late so it

622
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,410
's almost okay

623
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:28,799
[Applause]
