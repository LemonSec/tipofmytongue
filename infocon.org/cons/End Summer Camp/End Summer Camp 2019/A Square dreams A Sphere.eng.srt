1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
so good evening everyone my name is

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,640
nicolò merendino and the first i introduce myself

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,960
even if we have already done a bit with

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,389
sebastiano i am only a designer and

5
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:13,769
let's say that in mine i have lived nor

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,630
for many years lived from amsterdam where

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,039
i worked before in a  place called

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,380
style which is a research center

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,430
specializing in the development of

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,439
electronic musical instruments for another

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,070
two years in another fab lab in another

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,050
situation it is called pack society always

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,000
in amsterdam and now for two years now I have been

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,560


15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,980
living in lido di venezia  where I

16
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,600
opened my own studio with my own

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,340
digital manufacturing laboratory and nothing as a

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,690
professional I decided to adopt

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,250
this name who knows who killed the

20
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,070
count I don't want to bore you with the reasons

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,960
they have chosen but let's say dear it is

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,400
important for me to choose a name that

23
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,620
was  a question rather than a

24
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,800
definition and nothing and so let's start

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,970
by saying that I am a designer but

26
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,260
unlike many of my colleagues or

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,250
specialized  in the development of a

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,590
design research strongly focused

29
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,689
on electronic musical instruments and

30
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,869
on multimedia art so

31
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,490
let's say that my work is animals but it

32
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,200
is that of my clients are all

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,580
artists who need to

34
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,790
develop their instruments, their installations and

35
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,770
the  my job is to

36
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,369
assist them in the development of their

37
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,020
pieces this for example I did not

38
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,189
do it for me my colleague

39
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,159
called yuri suzuki did it and let's say they

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,189
are objects that depending on the shape

41
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,409
make a different sound and I chose

42
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,240
this  slide to communicate the fact

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,420
that the union between design and music is very

44
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,729
fruitful let's say trying to research

45
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,969
a bit for

46
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,490
a shape for an object that makes

47
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,229
sound is a type of research that offers

48
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,190
many, let's say interesting ideas

49
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,420
for producing objects and nothing,

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,650
let's say no  another time my work

51
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,959
precisely to develop state that

52
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,060
develops tools this for example is

53
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,830
a piece that I did for  an

54
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,390
artist lineage that matures the former now it that a

55
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,610
tear nyon and is a voice controller

56
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,810
there is an instrument that the performer

57
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,160
wears holds in his hand and he

58
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,630
permanently moving this

59
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,160
device together with another can

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,459
modulate the sound of the live voice that is

61
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:33,320
he  sings and moving this controller

62
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,030
changes the sound of his voice it is

63
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,230
a bit strange to say that

64
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,989
paradoxically in my work I

65
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:41,760
deal with everything about a

66
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,010
musical instrument except the sound that is the sound

67
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,080
is a part that is generally dealt with by

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,989
the  my clients now a very

69
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:50,730
important part of my work

70
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,280
as before i mentioned the so-called

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,110
critical mac in this is a term

72
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,850
coined by a canadian researcher

73
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,209
garnett hearts and that we say this the

74
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,340
counter argues that the act of

75
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,209
designing an object is not just an

76
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,329
act let's say the end  to himself but which

77
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,220
has repercussions and personally

78
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,019
I like to approach my

79
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,079
profession in two ways the first

80
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,450
is as regards  the content in the

81
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,010
sense that I believe that the act of

82
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,410
designing technological objects that are in

83
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,739
some way different from

84
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,600
what the market offers is in some

85
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,269
way an act of protest if not

86
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,480
even rebellion and this does not apply

87
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,459
only to what it is  the car of my

88
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:39,870
work but also how I do my

89
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,940
job and as I mentioned before I

90
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,239
chose a few years ago to use

91
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,180
only open source tools to

92
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,430
develop the projects I do

93
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,709
other thing taken by garnett third this

94
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,109
is a provocative object called the

95
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,019
von  hammer which is an object that was born

96
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,030
with the intent of breaking smartphones

97
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,470
this is a project of the oratory that

98
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,239
when you see the century points smartphone

99
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,780
that you do not row

100
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,300
the splits the smartphone has one but

101
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,480
has not brought it do not worry

102
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,530
then it takes a bit of my process

103
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,569
let's say that the process that follows the

104
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,970
development of a project goes through

105
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,168
these phrases are totally a

106
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:20,889
prototyping a sketch the

107
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:24,040
circuit design a 3d model that almost always

108
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,370
what we say the development before

109
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,520
starting vector graphics for the

110
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,810
front panels of the instruments I

111
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,480
do and finally the assembly of the

112
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,760
production of what I do now as

113
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,340
you can see rather that does not have a

114
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,020
linear scheme

115
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,490
here I drew a spiral because

116
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,460
often these phases

117
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,190
that I am about to illustrate do not

118
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,780
always follow one of the chronological ones

119
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,840
that happen from point 3 then you go back to

120
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,850
point 1 because it turns out that what we

121
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,370
thought was not the right way

122
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,180
and so  away in short then let's say that

123
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,190
during this presentation I

124
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,750
put all the processes that

125
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,510
I follow in order a little but in real life in quotes

126
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,000
the process is much more convoluted and much

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,479
more recursive than what I am about to explain

128
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,669
and therefore during this presentation I

129
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:18,330
thought first of illustrating  step by step

130
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,760
the various these steps you see in this

131
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,770
slide and then I will also bring precise cases

132
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,600
of tools that I have developed  developed

133
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,750
in recent years by dan

134
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,729
but as I said before the first one whose

135
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:32,380
start generally with the development a

136
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,900
project is a prototype that is my

137
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,750
customers come to me with something

138
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,260
like that there is a brad bird of the buttons of the

139
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,640
knobs or of the sensors and  I along with

140
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,810
them

141
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,670
develop these brad birds all

142
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,710
messed up you transform them into

143
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,620
a somewhat more stable instrument a little more usable

144
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,970
not only but I have also brought here some

145
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,940
instrument prototypes if afterwards you want to

146
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,140
try to play with something is

147
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,180
something else these prototypes I generally

148
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,850
use  the urban man as I imagine many of

149
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,230
us in here

150
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,210
sometimes use other platforms like

151
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,370
the team yes like this you see here

152
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,450
a team yes a team of two it seems to me and

153
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,590
or another for hours is called beautiful

154
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,100
platform which are all open platforms

155
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,220
source obviously that allow those who

156
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,800
want to invent a tool the

157
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,620
rudiments in short, let

158
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,150
's say the accessibility to maneuver the

159
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,330
electronic circuits and program them once

160
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,880
h  or this first meeting began to

161
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,500
draw that is I use

162
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,840
traditional techniques such as drawing rather

163
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,390
than the creation of models made with

164
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,680
cardboard paper in short, what I have to

165
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,770
understand a bit the direction we want to

166
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,800
go with the artist

167
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,540
for this in short, I use felt-tip pens

168
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,840
what I find done  show begins one

169
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,970
of the most complicated but also the most

170
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,100
interesting parts of my work but will see the

171
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,620
design of the pisi b as you can see

172
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,780
an object like this is not exactly

173
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,060
usable nor ergonomic

174
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,130
so once we have established more or less the

175
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,120
shape they want to give our

176
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,140
instrument  I use kaikan to say

177
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,300
order to make a moment more

178
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,330
compact the circuit is precisely the cache

179
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,180
from a completely open source software

180
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,250
that I do not know who is who of you is familiar

181
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,830
with charge but in short it is an

182
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,680
extremely flexible software for free that

183
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,430
allows everyone to

184
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,310
start  to work with electronics

185
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,000
once a circuit with cai cad

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,620
use is made  a numerical control cutter

187
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,620
most of the time to engrave a pcb now

188
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,490
using a numerical control socket

189
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,680
i don't know if you are familiar with this

190
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,080
gig but it is possible to create

191
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,090
pisi b how does this process

192
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,210
really work i use a material which is

193
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,520
a glass plate join it  calls in

194
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,940
Italian with a very thin layer

195
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,699
of copper on top and with the sense socket I am able

196
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:16,370
to isolate the paths that I need to

197
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,470
isolate and thus create the connections that

198
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,270
in short are necessary for the

199
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,440
functioning of an instrument

200
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,419
obviously this can only be done in

201
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:28,039
phase  of prototyping since this

202
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,990
material is not really not very

203
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,849
long-lived i.e. something like this

204
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:34,520
after two years unfortunately begins to

205
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,190
oxidize or to come away

206
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,520
and alternatively most of the time they

207
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,120
end up commissioning the production of

208
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,529
an hour of a real piece

209
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:48,050
ibba some to some company in

210
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,029
the sibi project or an example of

211
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,130
this too if you want to 38 if you want to see

212
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,100
a  bit the result also brought some

213
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,209
examples

214
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:58,250
this is an old prototype you have

215
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,650
in your left hand you have a prototype

216
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,170
milled with the sense cutter while on your

217
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:03,709
right

218
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,380
you have a visible one produced in short

219
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,459
industrially the audits the other in the

220
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:11,959
industrially fairies

221
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,360
here not seen but with charge  a

222
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,820
super thing that you can do too

223
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,279
if you start from inkscape make a

224
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,959
better graphics exist to import it

225
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,270
on load and thus make

226
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,060
very interesting graphics its circuits

227
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,529
which I enjoy very much to do in fact

228
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:29,870
if for example in one of the two c  'is a

229
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,760
graphic inspired by a painting called

230
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,660
lightning composer by fortunate depero

231
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,070
what is this the result let's say

232
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,550
of a milling ok so once

233
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,589
you have the circuit in your hand past

234
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:45,350
another software that africa

235
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,470
to model the body now freak ad

236
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,700
also here it is a parametric software

237
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,940
similar to to tell us solidworks or inventor

238
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,750
of autodesk that allows us to

239
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,370
develop a three-dimensional volume  ional

240
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,940
that it is then printable in 3d in fact, once

241
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,810
this phase is over, the slider often passes more

242
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,620
and then it has a finished body

243
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,870
this is enough this image is not very

244
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,120
quality but if you want here too it has a

245
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,279
body as an example of what it is a

246
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,390
little bit like  output of this phase

247
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,440
oh well this is generally between this

248
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,000
here praised finished if you want to pass

249
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,460
you do not steal it but this is the object

250
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,190
ok so once printed in 3d my

251
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,710
volume passes from another phase is that

252
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,960
of the front panel also that is in the

253
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,970
yours in the product that is

254
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,710
running to make this program I

255
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,600
use inscape that we have already mentioned

256
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,600
is that a vector graphics software

257
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,390
nothing with with inscape what procedure

258
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,370
I generally follow what I do and what I

259
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,090
import in svg the circuit I

260
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,700
made with cai cad and then  draws

261
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,440
a front panel over it so that obviously

262
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,740
the various elements of the star of

263
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,390
the front panel coincide with the

264
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,840
position of the elements of the elements

265
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,810
in short, taken  nti in the circuit it is a

266
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,250
cool thing to mention the use of

267
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,780
open source software that an

268
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,360
interesting thing in doing transversal jobs

269
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,920
like me that unlike

270
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,140
commercial software where you find situations in

271
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,540
which for example you have dubbed from each other it

272
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,610
is therefore difficult to import

273
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,490
from illustrator to autocad this for

274
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,040
marketing reasons because obviously

275
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,110
everyone tries to steal

276
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,040
each other's customers

277
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,660
the open source software this thing is a

278
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,850
problem that does not even exist if you

279
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,940
need to develop an object

280
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,380
anything using different

281
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,540
open source software very hardly

282
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,420
run into problems of  non-

283
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,040
compatibility between software for the

284
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,900
simple fact that no one

285
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,120
gains by being protective with their

286
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,100
formats and therefore this here in

287
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,130
particular is one of the phases of the

288
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,300
project in which the use of

289
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,950
open source software makes my life

290
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,670
much easier and nothing  in short, these

291
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,500
vector graphics made with

292
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,510
inkscape are p  produced generally or

293
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,040
with a laser cutting machine or

294
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,570
that has no grip either in yes I

295
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,550
personally at my time in my

296
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,200
workshop with two silent cutters and therefore I

297
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,329
use the laser cutting machine grip much more often

298
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:33,399
but as you can

299
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,180
see this the part here at  left

300
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,550
of the slide let's say it is a

301
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,980
physical version of what I

302
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,339
previously designed with the software inc

303
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:50,680
skate and this is the

304
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,140
front panel which by the way is and part

305
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,250
of the object that you are

306
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,940
spinning right now is nothing

307
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,810
once  after this he assembles everything and

308
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,050
nothing

309
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,510
the instrument is done and therefore this is

310
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,540
a bit of the workflow that I am following so

311
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,839
now that I have explained to you a bit how the

312
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,490
procedure follows I want to show

313
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,649
also specific cases of instruments that

314
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:17,680
I have made in the past  bring two

315
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,750
the first is called lightning laughs and

316
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,870
damn you don't see anything but the fact

317
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,610
is that you see a project I did

318
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,579
for a collective called  ii who

319
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:29,829
stands for instrument investors initiatives

320
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:32,320
and lives in the hague in the netherlands and in

321
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,699
particular has worked for matteo

322
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:35,199
marangoni reserving rehn who have

323
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,269
developed this project which

324
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:41,279
consists of a set of 70 small devices

325
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,540
each of which to the possibility of

326
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,130
seeing speak in quotation marks and put

327
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,079
a light and the interesting thing about

328
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,010
this project that one of these

329
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,940
devices

330
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,279
you can start a conversation with

331
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,589
a similar one then we will see better it can also

332
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:58,839
bring a video where everything is much

333
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,600
easier to understand but now I will show you

334
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,769
a little the process that led to the

335
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:05,500
realization of these 70 devices

336
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,839
among other things do 70 things with these

337
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,490
techniques but very bad idea don't

338
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,199
do it

339
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:13,120
then as before the artists

340
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,649
came to me with this one here which is a

341
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:16,810
very basic prototype of

342
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,610
how the positive works so as

343
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,779
I told you before

344
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:22,120
here we have a speaker that was, let's say,

345
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,070
the voice of each of these

346
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,130
devices, a led that was their

347
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,230
possibility  to emit sounds a

348
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,250
microphone that is attached here and

349
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,260
somewhere that however I do not see asi and

350
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,020
here there is an alle br that has a

351
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,850
light sensor that allowed these devices

352
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,579
let's say to see

353
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,770
let's say the concept that will be

354
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,350
behind it  this this project was that

355
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,990
each of these small devices

356
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,399
had to be somehow perceived

357
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,190
with a small creature that the user

358
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,980
had to lift and carry around so

359
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,510
as to create a situation of

360
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,579
conviviality among everyone

361
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:03,999
and then I started to see a little

362
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:06,699
which are objects in some way

363
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:08,110
characterized in such a way as to

364
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,089
look like living beings and therefore

365
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:11,739
I have seen let's say that the inspirations for

366
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:14,019
what were on the one hand this

367
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:15,730
thing called the elite badge that

368
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,809
comes from a comic called

369
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:19,299
berserk and this  it is a pendant that in

370
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:20,069
some way

371
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,230
actually speaks the story more complicated

372
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,069
but this exhaustive and then this other one to

373
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:28,929
do here that comes from a film

374
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,699
called  9 by tim burton

375
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:33,040
we had to get excited I show that it is a

376
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,799
skeleton therefore with organic parts

377
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:38,290
but a skeleton animated by some

378
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,739
mechanical parts so that with this thing

379
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:42,819
that the artists asked me I

380
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:45,569
did a bit of thematic research on

381
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,809
examples of objects bar things that

382
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:52,739
followed  a little their their will

383
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:54,730
then that I did started to

384
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,100
feel sorry so I thought about bo of a little

385
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,269
creature that needs to be

386
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:00,279
helped then open or passed a

387
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,160
turtle that is that on the back and that

388
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,249
therefore a user may want to turn around I

389
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,799
thought  to organic shapes like a

390
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,749
mollusk that if you think about a mollusk there is

391
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:13,299
a part that those who are harder and

392
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,040
easier to handle another that instead

393
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,529
more delicate none of this

394
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:19,540
actually liked them then they told me

395
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,189
we want a trumpet  here he had

396
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,739
brought me a funnel and then I did well

397
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:25,329
to scare you want the funnel then let's

398
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,919
work on this funnel

399
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,079
so I learned some plasticine and or

400
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,540
let's say started to expand  and this

401
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,540
funnel that idea of creating a creature

402
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,410
this funnel nothing so I thought about

403
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,429
how it can be

404
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:40,449
in the meantime they came up with the

405
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:43,029
idea of cocoon started doing

406
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:44,949
all the concepts with the cocoon lia

407
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:47,259
thought to take some string and

408
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:48,999
create a species  of nest around

409
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:51,399
these devices, however, this thing a

410
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,610
little complicated because rolling 70 70

411
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,309
devices with the string was a bit I'm

412
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,350
a bit challenging so in the end we

413
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,720
came to this conclusion that if you

414
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,910
mind it was a trumpet like the one with a

415
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,980
tongue that I saw before inside

416
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,319
then we inserted the ribs that

417
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,000
would then go to constitute the

418
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,079
shape of the

419
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,409
object itself and therefore that he did

420
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,679
from humphrey cad started to modulate

421
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,049
this modeling a little sorry this

422
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:22,569
this trumpet where we see that the

423
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,089
shape here let's say I don't know  if very clear

424
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,709
why the welfare is not seen very well,

425
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:29,289
however, it presents the trumpet that what

426
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,870
allows the device to we tell you to

427
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,669
be amplif  icare the sound as much as

428
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:36,580
possible where there are these

429
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,440
housings inside which

430
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,210
the ribs are inserted which will then form

431
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,960
let's say the shape of the object itself in

432
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,519
addition to the trumpet I also made a

433
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,590
back that obviously served to

434
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,769
close everything so that I  did he made

435
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,039
a first 3d print with this machine

436
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,250
which is a makerbot those of the mayday

437
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,779
of the perfidious traitors so do not

438
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:01,029
buy an email for any reason but

439
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:02,559
at the time we still did not know so I

440
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,220
had one and then I laser cut the

441
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,840
various broken ribs  the coasts are

442
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,980
what has been the most

443
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,779
intense research and for which he dared to skate

444
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:12,690
takes all these things that you see they

445
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,649
must have been giving shape

446
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:17,500
to the final object

447
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,360
as you see in this way anyway

448
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,799
so we see that it was here  the

449
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,190
trumpet that was printed in 3d and all

450
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,690
these things that were

451
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,580
laser cut here then decided to put

452
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,919
the light on the front and as

453
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,510
you can see c  i imagined that

454
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,820
users would hold the object in this

455
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,320
way it offers it to be a bit outward

456
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,090


457
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,260
so this has finally been

458
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,679
approved after months of research is ok

459
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,940
so initially I had thought of

460
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,409
making a bell that was very

461
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:47,260
ergonomic that is as you can see it can be seen  well

462
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,179
but this shape is very linear I

463
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:50,980
took it and this was in fact a kind

464
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,260
of bell except that no the bell was not good

465
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,870
because it was too

466
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,010
conventional and therefore they asked me

467
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,649
that all these ribs had to

468
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:02,350
be more organic anymore I don't know anymore

469
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,210
more sufferers have used this

470
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:04,659
word

471
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:07,600
and so here I am in short making

472
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,850
renderings because prototyping takes a

473
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,529
lot of time this

474
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:15,100
in fact make them with blender if you

475
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,390
start fiddling with blender

476
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,160
you will find that the renderings of blender

477
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,620
have nothing to envy to  the

478
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,710
commercial ones and therefore nothing I started

479
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,530
to crush in short, think of a bit of

480
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,230
shapes for the combined with laser cuts but

481
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,260
this first version seemed too much

482
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,260
as to say too massive

483
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,330
so we made it lose weight and the

484
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,330
final result is this here as you can

485
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,850
see there are some the circuit and in the

486
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,680
meantime we have developed and made a

487
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,750
little more compact even the

488
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,520
front part that is  remembers the tera very

489
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,340
much

490
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,370
how to say very rough now it had

491
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,960
assumed this teardrop shape and the

492
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,640
ribs that compared to before were much

493
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,610
more much thinner in some way

494
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,380
and consequently easier to manage

495
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,970
and also made it

496
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,620
lighter because before in the version

497
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,430
this here  the object was pretty heavy and

498
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,170
nothing so once we decided this

499
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,490
thing

500
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,950
bonn mass production we started

501
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,320
making 70 of these cases here that I

502
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,840
assure you guys has a really

503
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,040
bad idea that is these techniques

504
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,800
you have to make a production during the day

505
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,820
that while we are at it  gives you a bit

506
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,480
of a smattering of digital fabrication

507
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,150
factory is a fantastic technique however

508
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,300
it just isn't suited to  production

509
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,760
let's say on a large scale let's say that if

510
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,620
you have only one 3d printer and you

511
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,390
have to make a production of pieces greater than

512
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,350
20 it is probably more convenient to

513
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,670
approach another

514
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,860
production technique even if the number 70 is a

515
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,750
really infamous number because it is too

516
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,570
little  to be industrial but too much

517
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,240
to be done with digital techniques

518
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,740
we have opted for the

519
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,540
3d printer because in the end we

520
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,120
had it so we said oh well

521
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,440
we do this thing here but it was a

522
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,410
bad idea

523
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,080
you do not do it and nothing and this is the

524
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,130
final product

525
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,170
this product was actually a

526
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,970
huge success in the sense that it was

527
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,120
exhibited in many festivals it was

528
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,570
exhibited at the kick festival in belgium

529
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,010
exhibited at the beautiful festival for the 100 years

530
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,110
of the bauhaus which was held a few months

531
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,950
ago in berlin,

532
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,930
etc., etc.

533
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,820
for a while a report of

534
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,670
how the performance works so there is

535
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,740
a basket full of all these objects

536
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,440
that are given  i to the users

537
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,260
and then I many inter dise with each other

538
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,170
now i can even show you no i

539
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,330
didn't want to do this i can

540
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,129
also show you a video

541
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,940
7 volume

542
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,500
each of these objects emits

543
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,560
sounds

544
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:29,839
[Applause]

545
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:38,530
ok he knows everything he wants the video

546
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,140
but the thing  more cool than they can also

547
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,850
interact with each other if they put one

548
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,410
in front of the other they

549
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,360
start to copy the behavior

550
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,689
of the other

551
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,680
well

552
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,520
another one arrives

553
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,800
[Music]

554
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,790
understood

555
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:27,550
and the thing africa is that then you run away but

556
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,010
in front it seems that we  we have an

557
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,230
audience with this role a lot of

558
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,580
interesting interactions

559
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,830
and here everyone has one in hand

560
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,379
never

561
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,549
[Music]

562
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,200
and nothing we say that this is a

563
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,190
project that I am very fond of

564
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,110
because I said to myself before I believe

565
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,419
very much in the design of

566
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:28,820
devices that are strongly

567
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,090
antithetical to what the market

568
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,370
offers us I also see these things the

569
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,900
artists I have worked with because in fact it

570
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,150
is just an idea they see this with a

571
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,710
sort of anti smartpho  ne the device

572
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,910
that does not invite you to close in this way on

573
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,190
your screen but invites you vice versa

574
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,340
to approach the users around you

575
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,490


576
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:58,000
and that's all for this project but I

577
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,600
also wanted to show another project that

578
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,970
has the noise board now this here at

579
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,310
another project that instead I developed

580
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,410
here in Venice

581
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:12,130
in the past year and two words let's say

582
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,270
that it was a project that I did

583
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,130
together with an artist called Giovani di

584
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,230
la binello and a skater Primo

585
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,210
d'alessandro rizzo was financed

586
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,360
with a by the municipality  of venice through

587
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,790
a tender that in short we won

588
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,340
what is the noise bordin noise board I

589
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,340
tried one here even if it does not work

590
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,650
because the receiver was Giovanni and

591
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,300
absolutely a skateboard on that

592
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,280
we mounted sensors so that the

593
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,530
movements of the skateboard are

594
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,480
transformed by an accelerometer into data

595
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,170
and sent to a computer via wi fi and

596
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,140
transformed into music by an artist who

597
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,000
was I'm point oh well

598
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,260
you still feel ok you are nothing  and also

599
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,320
here as we started we say that

600
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,670
the idea of for this project was to

601
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,110
put an electronic device

602
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,480
attached to a skateboard that you

603
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,730
will say easy except that you have no

604
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,020
idea how many blows the

605
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,280
skateboard watches so the first thing

606
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,310
we did is  was to get us a

607
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,890
used skateboard from d'alessandro who was the

608
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,950
skater we had in the team and by looking

609
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,690
a bit at a board used over

610
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,280
the years we have a bit identified

611
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,720
which are the areas that take less

612
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,420
blows and which consequently have fewer

613
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,340
scratches and which ones  they are the areas that

614
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,260
hit the most bumps and what came

615
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,270
out is that the only area of the skate

616
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,270
board that does not take a beating or almost is the

617
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:36,280
underneath of the wheel and so a ok

618
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,080
first thing I created this modeled on

619
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,010
free cad this  this cube that

620
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,600
somehow represented a bit of

621
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,400
what would later be sensors

622
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,780
because at this stage of the project

623
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,880
we still weren't sure what to

624
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,710
use so initially  ente we have

625
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,350
used this for a while this give me let's say

626
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,630
how how as an idea of what

627
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:59,110
could be circuits from dan and therefore

628
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,740
nothing as I told you

629
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,080
the under of the wheel is the only

630
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,809
area that is somehow repaired by

631
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:07,690
any bots

632
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,540
ok  then a bit of a bit of inspiration

633
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,770
let's say that the idea for this

634
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,010
tool was to think of the scheme

635
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,809
this device as a kind of

636
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:19,460
parasite that attached itself to the

637
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,440
skateboard and that somehow

638
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,990
changed its nature and not only but

639
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,340
we also have  made sure that this

640
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,660
parasite was not completely

641
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,059
organic but that it somehow

642
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:31,730
declared its technological nature and

643
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,280
last but not least we also did a

644
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,200
good research on lutherie and

645
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,270
on the appearance of the instruments what

646
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,700
we wanted to do absolutely

647
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,840
apply a little to what the  aesthetics

648
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,360
of musical instruments to an object

649
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,710
much

650
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:51,050
like saying modern like the skate board da

651
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,429
dan and therefore this is a little bit the

652
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,350
concept we did at the INI  uncle you have to

653
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,530
make a skateboard with a kind of

654
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:01,490
parasite attached to it and then the two fs

655
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,220
just like a violin and in fact now

656
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,540
I will explain to you let's say that I have divided

657
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,460
this this talking into two different

658
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,860
researches, first the research on

659
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,710
the strong sensors that singh and then a research

660
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,260
on the  research let's say more of graphic

661
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:20,330
design that led to alle f then

662
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,730
bam then once you decide finished a bit

663
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,340
like we wanted to do generated this

664
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,650
this shape a bit a bit patchy a

665
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,750
bit aragno I don't know how to say with four

666
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,540
legs that they are then  go insert the

667
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,910
surface of the skateboard and a great

668
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,400
finesse and that what we did is

669
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,540
that we took the model of a

670
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,340
skateboard since the skateboards are

671
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,830
all quite similar and used

672
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,600
a boolean function is complicated to

673
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,929
obtain a volume that goes to that

674
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,100
goes to  perfectly adhere

675
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,960
to the surface of the

676
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,540
skateboard in this manner if you see

677
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,630
this case is not flat but it is made in

678
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,670
so that it follows the curve

679
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,100
of the skateboard.

680
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,040


681
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,230


682
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,960


683
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,309


684
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:16,740


685
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,500


686
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,660
this we used

687
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,429
frica to because one thing freak strains to

688
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:28,620
you that there is not only two functions to

689
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,450
model but lately they have

690
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,190
improved more and more functions for

691
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,809
general g cod

692
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:37,190
so if you have a sense cutter

693
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,179
you can use freak to generate a

694
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,280
free with  a cycle that works very

695
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,450
well and then so we did

696
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,490
and nothing this is the skateboard with

697
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,200
this very first prototype inserted

698
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,470
done this we finally decided what

699
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,780
type of sensor to use the sensors

700
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,330
we used is called sun stage and

701
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,669
did not have to look for it because I'm cool

702
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:02,669
this is a  sort of very

703
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:05,100
compact arduino connected a wireless antenna

704
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,559
not you the wireless leaks b i don't know if

705
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,080
any of you  In short, however, he knows

706
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,340
this device that has an

707
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,320
integrated accelerometer which is

708
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,660
exactly what we needed and that

709
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,960
communicates via wireless so obviously

710
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,890
using a skate board

711
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,960
the idea of having a cable connected to a

712
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,820
skateboarder is obviously impractical

713
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,650
and therefore it happens that all  the

714
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,630
research let's say all the spouses who

715
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,640
had done so far have had to adapt a little

716
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,830
to the choice of this of this

717
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,680
device

718
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,600
and therefore nothing here you can see a

719
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,000
not a photo with a few notes that I

720
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,570
made

721
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,340
compared to the previous 20 that a little

722
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,860
enlarged moved some  elements

723
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,060
etcetera etcetera are let's say the

724
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:48,080
technical purposes that are there so

725
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,560
I went back to download it remodeled

726
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,390
and then I also made a cap only that

727
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,300
the cap had made a cap and

728
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,590
once this type was done we did a first

729
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,800
crash test that is we started in short

730
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,690
given this  case to alessandro I

731
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,240
told him you do your worst let's see if

732
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,730
it breaks and thanks  when the sky did

733
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:12,230
not split immediately after each road

734
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,970
work a little on the lid as

735
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,150
you can see this flat lid but

736
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,220
first it was not aesthetically interesting

737
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,310
and then to return to the open source discourse it

738
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,000


739
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,700
was a device that hides its

740
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,110
content

741
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,640
and since I say  that at first I

742
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,850
am against the concept of black box

743
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,320
we have all thought together to make a

744
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,850
device in some way reveal

745
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,130
the presence of something inside it

746
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:37,730


747
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,670
so we have practiced these

748
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,380
slots and then we have put lenses

749
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,090
that coincide with small LEDs

750
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,010
that  I am on the sun stage that

751
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,930
somehow make

752
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,180
the object light up a little in this

753
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,760
way if you see then made the

754
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,310
cap we tried it again

755
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,110
then I printed it in black for

756
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,920
much cooler aesthetic reasons we

757
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,260
applied on his new skate boards  then

758
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,270
we will see later and the skateboards and

759
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,710
then we started the search number

760
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,000
two it really is not true that it has  mo

761
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,650
started later these

762
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:19,370
researches went a bit even for reasons

763
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,470
of time but in short for

764
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,600
this demonstration to think about

765
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,370
dividing them so as to make a little more

766
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:29,030
order and nothing therefore as I said before

767
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,530
initially what we did is

768
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,900
study a violin making manual  and understand

769
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,880
a little what are the

770
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,340
main characteristics of an instrument in

771
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,440
particular to the f of the violin which in

772
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,900
theory have an acoustic function

773
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,590
that we do not need since our

774
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,510
digital interface, however, was

775
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,190
interesting as a research so what

776
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,200
we did before

777
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,530
we analyzed these a bit  f

778
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,030
oh well we really did some

779
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,860
sketches on the table to see a minimum of

780
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,460
how in short how it seemed that he

781
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,680
waited had then I switched to in

782
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,250
skate already mentioned software of which I

783
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,510
repeat the beta of version one has just come out

784
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,180
which is the end of the world and

785
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,170
approve it because  it is orgasmic and nothing

786
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,190
we have done a little of the elaborations

787
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,530
around it  to fe that now you

788
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,900
see them so very slender in reality they

789
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,050
are much more stocky in fact the first

790
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,210
ride we did was another

791
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,100
this here we did a

792
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,110
part of the skate because

793
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,510
as I said before, make a switch from

794
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,230
inscape  a africa is very easy which is

795
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,850
a great turning point because so if you want to

796
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,400
make an object in 3d with

797
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,440
very elaborate graphics or shapes you can

798
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,060
do the two-dimensional part on inscape

799
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,950
which is very performing with

800
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,890
regards to curves and stuff like that

801
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,580
and then  import them on on on free card

802
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,340
so nothing I made a board did

803
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,900
these f generated a ride on free cad

804
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,360
then with my faithful machine senses the

805
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,580
o engraved on

806
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,960
the skateboard and we did

807
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,880
this simulation always with the skates

808
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,639
we also did some

809
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,350
let's say purely graphic proofs of how

810
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,630
these fs actually seemed a matter

811
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,639
of making fs exactly identical to

812
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,620
those of a violin, it initially seemed like

813
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,389
a '  very very cool idea

814
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:24,639
however in reality it seemed a bit

815
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,139
didactic that is to make the f

816
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,719
exactly the same as those of the

817
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,940
violin boh it didn't make much sense even

818
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,679
for the past we said before that these

819
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,120
fs are on donkeys they are made like this

820
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,060
because they have a function  but for

821
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,239
our case they had to be

822
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,980
a little more abstract figures a little more evocative

823
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,159
rather than just a 1 to 1 copy and

824
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,040
so we had the fantastic idea of

825
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,540
drawing this f using a

826
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,000
texture which by the way is the same

827
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,360
texture that  we put sensors on the cap of the

828
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,830
dl that singh so

829
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,390
somehow on the screen we have these

830
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,730
oblique lines which are a texture that is

831
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,970
in fact generated by a

832
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,800
boolean association between a texture like this and

833
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,610
the fs we have seen so

834
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:14,050
far this is okay we are  back up on

835
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,000
inscape to draw this texture

836
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,370
we went back to free card to generate

837
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,200
the gip cod

838
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,470
then what did he cut engraved

839
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:26,260
in short, these fs on the smo skate

840
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,240
boa  rd and by the way a bit

841
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,800
funny note that we need

842
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,230
a skateboard that was wooden because

843
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,270
we liked it to be wooden is the

844
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,370
closest thing we found to this

845
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,780
thing from this joke for an

846
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,630
avocado madonna made above so o  sanded

847
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,660
away the madonna and so we had

848
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,980
our final shape the [ __ ] but shape

849
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,600
the final look you see i have in my

850
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,810
hand is nothing then we made

851
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,360
these engravings now a cool thing

852
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,980
i don't know if you knew i didn't

853
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,900
know but  the skateboards reviews in

854
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,050
profile are made from seven layers of

855
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,460
wood of different colors

856
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,440
this for reasons that no one

857
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,180
has been able to explain to me but all the

858
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,850
skateboards have different layers

859
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,630
so that

860
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,940
the engravings we have made are

861
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,619
even more fascinating because somehow they

862
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:16,269
detect a little  soul of the

863
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:19,269
skateboard and therefore in this photo you see

864
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:21,819
a bit of a zoom of the different results that

865
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:24,190
you have by engraving these fs on different

866
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,529
skateboards so er  as long as every

867
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:27,940
skateboards somehow had

868
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,859
its own identity if we want to

869
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:32,849
call it so Po I have done this

870
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:36,640
manual work or brushed a

871
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,319
protective varnish on the screens because

872
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:41,349
I had just milled and sanded and

873
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:42,940
this is the final result that the

874
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,400
skateboard with the catas shoe

875
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,869
the work if you want you can also pass

876
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:48,039
this because you brought a prototype

877
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:54,910
or of this if you are interested and

878
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,720
nothing and I also show you a video

879
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,339
of how this skateboard plays this

880
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:06,029
let's say it is a

881
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,710
so with this let's say it a

882
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,740
basic demo and then for the x since  the notice he

883
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,120
visited before they mentioned was

884
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,100
on the street art

885
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,980
giovanni who is the let's say the

886
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,980
musician we collaborated with meant

887
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,930
that the movements of the skateboard did not

888
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,850
make precise sounds but that they

889
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,860
matured a look that was a little hip

890
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:50,900
hop and that  so it makes a sound like this

891
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,620
nothing mentally in this in this

892
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,230
set there is a beat that made a chat a

893
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,330
thun cia but if it  I will write

894
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,610
this look faster and if I ska the

895
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,010
band I slow down the pace is much

896
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:25,150
slower and nothing oh well with this

897
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,520
project soon exhibited in Venice at the

898
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,740
Lido once once at the Parco della

899
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,960
Bissuola where we organized the

900
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,350
modico

901
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:41,989
[Music]

902
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,320
and  nothing so in fact we have

903
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,870
tried it in different places those

904
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,460
above are at the park of the bissuola and

905
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,210
those below are at the beach where among

906
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,620
other things they are frightening about that

907
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,240
story of the green beach because between the

908
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,160
skaters of the lido and the local policemen

909
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,890
that is  tv a feud that has been going on for years

910
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,780
and that was the first time

911
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,940
these tax authorities finally had

912
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,620
to skate with a permit from the

913
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,160
municipality

914
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,220
so the policeman arrived

915
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,000
rubbing his hand with the truncheon

916
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,100
but dhabi we showed them the

917
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,870
permit csen ha  had to go away

918
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:24,670
mortacci his coming nice video we have

919
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,890
already seen and this is the end of my

920
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,730
speech

921
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,700
so nothing if you want to look around for me I

922
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,990
'm on twitter face  book instagram

923
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,220
worse than chiara ferragni

924
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,930
this also a site that killed the count

925
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,520
help point you can see these

926
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,520
projects others is nothing if you have questions

927
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,760
write me

928
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,190
if you want or even brought some

929
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,230
small devices with which we can

930
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,119
play if you want that they are a

931
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,099
theremin based on  arduino and an fm synth

932
00:39:57,099 --> 00:39:58,510
also based on arduino in

933
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,609
particular on an ardino library

934
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:02,859
called moggi is a very

935
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,660
particular library because it allows arduino

936
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,180
to emit sounds that generally

937
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,309
cannot I do not dwell on

938
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:11,799
technical explanations but trust me that it is a great

939
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:13,230
turning

940
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,520
nothing this actually brings us to the

941
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,920
second part of my talk that is to say

942
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,079
the workshop if you want and needed

943
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,720
we can do a freak workshop

944
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,910
where we can do the

945
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,260
modeling of a knob together

946
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,270
now if you want we can do it live

947
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,829
otherwise just yesterday I did  a

948
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:40,240
new tutorial that you can find on vimeo

949
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,220
so if you want to approach

950
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,319
this world let's say of the interior  raction

951
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,470
design and music

952
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:50,770
you can go to vimeo search for frica from

953
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,170
a tutorial version 0.18

954
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,720
and here you will find a little bit of the rudiments

955
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,150
of built 3d modeling needed

956
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:03,000
to model a knob

957
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:10,140
nothing this is all thanks for

958
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:10,730
your attention

959
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:15,730
[Applause]
