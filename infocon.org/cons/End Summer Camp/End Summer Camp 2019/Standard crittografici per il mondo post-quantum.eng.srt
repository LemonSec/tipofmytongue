1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:03,929
one evening then my name is fernando

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,410
i am a researcher in the field of

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,759
cryptography and i am here to talk about

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,109
sight going a bit as it means

5
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:17,220
cryptographic standards that should

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,590
be resistant to attacks carried out

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:26,099
with quantum computers lover there is the

8
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,140
following and this we say l  'the only

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,980
really important part maybe we talked about

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,630
quantum computers in the past and

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,030
now we started talking about

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,250
cryptographic standards the united states government

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,160
through nist has decided that the

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,829
time to standardize to have

15
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:46,680
software that protocols that are

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,770
considered safe and  these

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,620
protocols in the next 20 years

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,340
will become part of bpm's ssh tls and

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,410
any other type of library that

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,079
uses cryptography and

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,439
since in fact the United States government

22
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,670
decides the encryption that everything more or

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,140
less all the  rest of the world uses it is

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,930
very important that these standards

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,840
are scrutinized before they are

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,299
defined  completely and also that

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,340
benchmarks are made because it is not certain

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,979
that a new standard is good for everyone

29
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,770
possible that there are problems downstream it

30
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,840
would be better to discover them when

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,400
the standard is not yet fully defined and

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,020
when changes can still be proposed

33
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,020
to make  a bit of a summary a

34
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,329
point of the

35
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,070
situation we talk about

36
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,650
public key cryptography is what allows for

37
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,290
example to communicate in a

38
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,630
confidential manner to authenticate other parts

39
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,850
in order to be sure of who you

40
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,380
are with whom you are talking to and until

41
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,950
now the  problems that existed from the point

42
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,600
of view of security could be

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,090
how these standards were used

44
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,320
how these tools were

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,689
used how keys were

46
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,030
distributed then how public

47
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,110
key infrastructure was done

48
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,639
or they could have to deal with

49
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,790
concrete problems an implementation with a bug

50
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,350
or with wrong parameters the keys

51
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,480
were too short and therefore the scheme

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,760
was not safe there

53
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,240
public key cryptography was discovered in 1976 and

54
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,750
various ways to build it have been proposed since then

55
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,160


56
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,640
but the ones that are actually part

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,230
of the code that are

58
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,510
actually used are based

59
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,980
on the difficulty of three mathematical problems

60
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,500


61
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,780
one is called rsa perhaps the best known and  then

62
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,790
there are problems of the

63
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,000
discrete logarithm problems on something

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,230
called finite field or on

65
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,340
something else called

66
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,980
elliptic curve and it doesn't matter why they

67
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,810
are how they work why they are

68
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,170
difficult or they are not

69
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,400
with respect to the concept of difficult yes

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,230
talks about the fact that if a key

71
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,980
n bits long and the number of operations

72
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,040
required to say to attack

73
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,690
this this scheme to solve

74
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,560
this problem should be

75
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,989
exponential in a number of bits

76
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:15,760
so that very short keys

77
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,950
allow us to bind an attacker

78
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,000
to  a lot of time

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,890
possibly more time than I

80
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:26,019
have available in 94 and later  97

81
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,720
shore introduces an algorithm that

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,459
should make the

83
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,910
discrete logarithm problem rsa problems

84
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:39,160
easy to solve and yet there is a

85
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,810
caveat there is a problem this algorithm

86
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,019
requires a quantum computer and

87
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,510
quantum computers if we talk about it re-entry

88
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,070
after  the idea was introduced by feynman it is

89
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,680
supposed or made a joke from

90
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,500
some point we do not actually know

91
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,360
who was the first to have this

92
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,230
idea

93
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,510
but in short, if we talk about it it is as if they

94
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,430
will arrive in twenty years but we talk about it

95
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,010
like this  for at least 20 years and therefore there has

96
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,379
been some skepticism for a long time

97
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,989
regarding the feasibility of such a

98
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:12,519
quantum computer and therefore also

99
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,769
of the need to overcome the

100
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:16,358
encryption based on arezzo on the

101
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,789
discrete logarithm but in the last

102
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:20,250
ten years

103
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,810
google has decided  to invest some

104
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,669
money

105
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,009
ibm has decided to invest some money

106
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:28,509
they also have a small one with two

107
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:30,220
quantum computers available online for

108
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,260
free if you want to

109
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,590
experiment with it  institutions and then microsoft has decided to

110
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,020
invest a lot of money and

111
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,820
clearly they also all went to

112
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,460
the same web designer for the site

113
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,080
on the computer on quantum computers

114
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,849
but it is possible that by then

115
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:53,979
their attention is well motivated maybe

116
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:55,660
now there will finally be really  that

117
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,389
acceleration with respect to which we should

118
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:01,599
worry the question and we should

119
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:02,919
worry is already now we should

120
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,050
worry neither between 30 40 to 100 years

121
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,380
when they will actually be built

122
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,440
de michele mosca who is one of the

123
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,380
best known experts in computing

124
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,539
speaks of his supposed theorem that

125
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:20,169
says well let's imagine it takes y

126
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:23,320
years to get to implement this

127
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,849
secure encryption against as many

128
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:27,310
computers as one computer and then

129
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,530
we generate some keys and use them to

130
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,870
encrypt a secret that must live i

131
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,520
would stay the secret for at least

132
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,409
hicks years and hicks it depends on what

133
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:37,479
we are  hiding if we are hiding

134
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:39,789
or if we are signing a certificate  that

135
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:41,169
is to last for the next six months

136
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:43,539
hicks might be six months but if

137
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:46,060
we're trying to protect a state secret

138
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,099
that is to last a hundred years it might

139
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,979
be 100 years if z the number of times

140
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:52,780
years they'll try to

141
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,940
build a computer and  z and

142
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,699
less than xp y then in case of

143
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,909
concern

144
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,990
one could add to this the fact

145
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,490
that if today we have a secret that

146
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,110
should be safe for a hundred years

147
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,480
and today we do not have as safe standards

148
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,120
as a computer and if an

149
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,550
opponent could access the

150
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,740
our cypher text and to put it away for

151
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,420
50 years until it builds as

152
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,640
a computer even if we can

153
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,230
later when we have a poor standard's

154
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,750
how much arinc delay will already be too

155
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,910
late because the opponent will still be able to

156
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,740
attack the old cipher that he

157
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,390
managed to find  for example the

158
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,040
old network traffic that has

159
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,170
captured the boss field at some point in the past

160
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,210
as much as

161
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,380
two-prior cryptography  in this moment one is to

162
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,270
build entry factories for which

163
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,540
data can be encrypted and in a more or

164
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,130
less equivalent way to exchange for

165
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,630
whom to agree on a key to be

166
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,950
used to encrypt and then

167
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,340
digital signatures and certificates and for the rest

168
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,650
of the  top I will talk about piquet and stieg

169
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,020
to refer to in both these two

170
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,670
types of technologies without having to write

171
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:12,220
the name in full by the way we

172
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,750
also know that there is something that

173
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,360
private key cryptography and indeed

174
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,650
often public key cryptography

175
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,510
is used with that private key

176
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,020
a public key cipher a

177
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,580
very short key which then uses a

178
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,310
private key sends the encrypted private key to the

179
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,020
other party and then uses the

180
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,420
key asymmetric encryption or the

181
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,580
private key because faster to

182
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,470
send terabytes of data or what we

183
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,410
are talking about is  here are let's say two

184
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,400
standard 1 standardized by liszt as and

185
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,560
then there is a de facto standard used

186
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,080
everywhere on the internet that  to this these

187
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,090
algorithms do not seem to be

188
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,640
particularly affected by how many

189
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,830
speed ups exist in computers and they can be

190
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,470
attacked faster but

191
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,290
not dramatically so there

192
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,700
is currently no particular

193
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,050
concern with respect to these schemes

194
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,450
but it is really possible that all  the

195
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,350
cryptography built up to 94 is

196
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,000
completely broken

197
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,610
no in fact there were schemes

198
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,740
proposed since the 70s that are

199
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,250
still safe for pique we can speak

200
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,660
for example of but that the stands and the

201
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,320
writer are two schemes that use

202
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,270
codes for correction  of errors and which

203
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,850
seems not to be attacked by by schemes

204
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,610
since a computer can be spoken of

205
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,710
ntro that a scheme of the nineties

206
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,929
for which we say built at the time

207
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,380
when sean discovered he discovered his

208
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,479
algorithm and then for the signatures there are

209
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,990
signatures  and based on this tris market and

210
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,990
these are not broken but are much

211
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,480
slower or more difficult to use,

212
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,370
for example signatures require  or

213
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,350
maintain that the state is maintained between one

214
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,940
signature and the other for this reason it is much more

215
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,030
difficult trans days actually

216
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,380
required this 20 years ago now

217
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,630
it is no longer the case but at the time they

218
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,250
were not standardized and for this reason

219
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,470
and but that there  if they require

220
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,210
public keys of several megabytes from the writer and

221
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,220
therefore or at least in their

222
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,410
original formulation for which even there they have been

223
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,520
ignored

224
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,520
but some areas are quite recent

225
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,490
some standards of anxiety of

226
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,600
tripoli exist but have not

227
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,130
been adopted en masse  or they are

228
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,710
very recent

229
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,480
this the only slide with jargon and this

230
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,790
i are the new candidate names to

231
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,870
replace the discrete logarithm will remain

232
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,290
we have candidates to be sure against

233
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,930
what a computer built before

234
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,790
those I mentioned but also there

235
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,800
if the writer with the  heroes correcting

236
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,990
code or those at les cayes bay

237
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,500
signatures and then there are those posts

238
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,010
like ntro

239
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,170
which is now often called a

240
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,360
problem ba  if of lattices and then there are

241
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,550
other multi-various problems with

242
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,470
hicks squares where we certainly use

243
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,960
second degree equations on many variables or

244
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,550
problems on elliptic curves but on

245
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,170
sogemes and of which 2 liters which super

246
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,730
singular these are all men

247
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,500
so there is no  it is one called picnic

248
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,920
for example it is nothing these are names

249
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,360
that we started looking for

250
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,340
about this algorithm of this problem

251
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,590
you might find so it seemed

252
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:26,420
interesting to let them live now the

253
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,160
timeline of what is happening with respect

254
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,050
to this standardization for  understand

255
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,360
who I am waiting for in this process because it

256
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,820
started a couple of years ago and at the

257
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,130
end I would also like to talk about how I think

258
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,340
the research community more generally not

259
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,020
necessarily can

260
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,360
contribute in a decisive way

261
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,310
to this type of

262
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,470
standardization

263
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,540
process.  2016 in reality this

264
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,940
research has been done for twenty years but in 2016

265
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,000
google does the first encryption tests

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,820
post as much as that  llo who do and

267
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,040
implement in boring ssl a scheme

268
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,230
called mine or those based on

269
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,770
lattices to do key exchange and

270
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,780
decide to first do a

271
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,040
traditional elliptic curve key exchange

272
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,790
of those we know to be safe

273
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,710
at least until now and then yes  do a

274
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,650
parallel swap using each pop

275
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,300
join the two keys merge xor and

276
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,740
then use that final key as

277
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,140
a shared key the reason why they

278
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,550
did this experiment which was

279
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,890
only enabled on google canary and from

280
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,660
what I remember only on services

281
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,970
google and to see how much

282
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,680
the network is slowed down by having to do an

283
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,500
exchange with coop for micov's hypertext keys

284
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,270
are several times longer than

285
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,070
cypher texas elliptic curves and therefore

286
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,250
it is not clear that it is so easy to

287
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,740
immediately manage the load of extra

288
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,270
data the load  of computation but

289
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,259
also

290
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:55,040
of communication then in 2016 the nsa makes

291
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,019
an indirect suggestion to the

292
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:58,609
united states government about the fact

293
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:00,259
that perhaps it is time to talk about pos

294
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,169
as an indirect crypto because he has

295
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:06,259
defined them as a set of

296
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,119
cryptographic algorithms which is called cypher sui b

297
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:10,699
i.e. safer singh there are

298
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:12,529
public key algorithms which are suggested as

299
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:17,209
they are considered safe from the beginning and  in

300
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:18,979
a status update made to the government a they

301
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:21,470
start talking about the fact that if

302
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,970
some of these companies have not

303
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,289
yet migrated their systems from rsa to

304
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,539
elliptical curves which are the latest

305
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:31,970
addition to the us air force b maybe it is not the

306
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,979
case that they  they spend all

307
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:35,359
that energy to do it because they

308
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:37,009
should already start worrying

309
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:39,019
instead about migrating directly

310
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:44,059
to imposed schemes what they leave it to the

311
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:47,229
institute for science technology they

312
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:50,499
decide to make a call for proposals

313
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:52,879
they decide to open and carry out a

314
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,439
standardization process  open as it was done

315
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:56,149
in 99 for example

316
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:00,259
in 2006 for others to open the

317
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,119
cryptographic community do not develop it

318
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:04,730
in secret this this work and ve

319
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,089
what are possible candidates

320
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:11,600
as much as anyone who has had the opportunity to

321
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,339
send proposals from any

322
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:14,899
country in the world

323
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:17,449
the conditions are that it must have must

324
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:19,189
be there must be a

325
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,949
formal specification and must have a

326
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:23,779
security analysis on why that algorithm is believed to

327
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:25,459
be  as safe as

328
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:27,859
a computer reference code in

329
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:29,679
standard c 99 that must compile

330
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,429
quietly on linux windows macos

331
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,659
possibly the code optimized

332
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:38,010
for 64 bit cpu

333
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,420
dt type intel asus and beckton test because

334
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,390
very difficult when one builds

335
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,180
cryptographic corners key since

336
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,350
the car  by necessity it must

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,760
have a random aspect it is very difficult

338
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,980
once encrypted what it would say but

339
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,240
that is the correct encryption

340
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,560
exactly as my algorithm

341
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,960
specifies for which it is asked that whoever

342
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,180
top who sends an algorithm

343
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,040
also proposes test vectors so that whoever

344
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,660
presents  can verify that their

345
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,910
correct implementation is something that

346
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,140
I forgot to add this slide

347
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,910
that asked that or specified

348
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,890
that whoever will win this competition

349
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,680
that they do not call competition and do not

350
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,480
call the winners winners but

351
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,080
call selected candidates will have to

352
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,880
issue any type of patent

353
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,800
on their algorithm so that anyone

354
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,470
is free  to implement it test it

355
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,540
study it and use it in industry

356
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,040
without being afraid of

357
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,610
legal repercussions they have also organized a

358
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,620
mailing list that you can see on google

359
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,830
groups to which you can subscribe

360
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,300
freely you can also send

361
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,580
messages safely to update

362
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,320
but also because so the community

363
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,820
cryptographic you can be notified if

364
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,710
attacks or new

365
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,630
implementations come out or if you have any

366
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:57,140
questions to ask in 2017 and towards the end of

367
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,520
2017

368
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,230
the deadline for proposals arrives and

369
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,380
82 proposals have been sent 69 have

370
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,310
been accepted by nist the others did not

371
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,010
satisfy the  requirements and 49 are for

372
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,200
encryption and the other 20 s  o for

373
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,470
digital signatures and they start a first round

374
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,020
of this standardization process

375
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,940
and they released this a few

376
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,310
weeks before christmas so there were

377
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,540
those who wanted to go on vacation but be

378
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,190
open to the hunt for

379
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,500
more or less safe schemes and some have been

380
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,490
immediately found because perhaps

381
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,010
not sent by academics with a

382
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,839
sufficient background to do this

383
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,950
type of work in 2017 mixed also

384
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,540
suggests a possible timeline it is

385
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,330
thought that starting December 2017

386
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,670
it is thought that in 2019

387
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,010
then it happened January a

388
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,290
second round of  standardization that

389
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,940
there will be a third possible round between

390
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,520
2020 and 2021 and that they possibly

391
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,980
want to have drafts for the

392
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,120
selected standards between 2022 and 2024

393
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,740
for which a 7-year process that will then

394
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,810
require adoption by

395
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,270
industry that usually lasts about twenty days

396
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,040
'years at least in 2018 in April they

397
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,839
did a workshop where all the candidates

398
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,310
who were still running were

399
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,990
inv  itati to go present their

400
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,399
scooter algorithm in their

401
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,790
properties and there were also there

402
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,200
was also an invited tokyo who

403
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,959
instead talked about work without

404
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,149
relative these algorithms without having it

405
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:31,420
without having sent one in particular

406
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,520
in 2019 the second was announced

407
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,339
round has reduced the cryptographic algorithms from 49 to 17

408
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:39,649
and from 20 to 9

409
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:42,500
those for digital signatures and sinis has

410
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,910
required to start working on

411
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,339
hot and rennes pj implementation of

412
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,380
these of these algorithms to see

413
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,480
from the bad point of view how performing they are

414
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,130
or what are the

415
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,230
possible problems of how much ram memory

416
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,089
a you need on a smart card to

417
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:57,800
make one of these algorithms work for

418
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,149
example klauser together with google have

419
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:06,740
also launched a large scale head

420
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,689
inspired by that of new co where they

421
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:10,900
took google channels and  they implemented

422
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,760
others another broader set

423
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,459
of candidate algorithms and they took

424
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,689
they asked claut fair to

425
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:20,030
implemen  borers the year added boring

426
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,500
ssl asked klaus where did chloe

427
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,209
hurley on their servers so they could

428
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,819
take stats like what is the

429
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,099
average load on servers but also what is

430
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,230
the one percent heavier load

431
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,700
on a server  how much

432
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,590
this can really slow down can slow down a

433
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,410
server and it is curious for example that one

434
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,460
of the schemes that curves

435
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,290
to its genes and between elliptical curves is

436
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,480
known to be the slowest scheme

437
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,180
ever or maybe it is not absolute but one

438
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,970
of the slowest schemes and google

439
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,040
asked please do not enable that

440
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,080
scheme on our domains because they

441
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,580
could be used for a denial of

442
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,830
service against our servers there was

443
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,620
a second workshop in August again at

444
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,730
nis where the

445
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,620
schemes and algorithms still remaining in the

446
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,930
race presented the

447
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,370
eni updates  there is also a suggestion he

448
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,320
said maybe at the end of this second

449
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,150
round which should take place according to them

450
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,070
between 2020 and 2021

451
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,510
maybe we can already sel  select

452
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,760
candidates for example candidates based

453
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,500
on but that the stands and the writer have existed

454
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,320
since the 70s they consider themselves safe since

455
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,720
the 70s so perhaps the case they are

456
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,430
mature has enough maybe they are not the

457
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,000
fastest

458
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,310
but if someone in urgency immediately to

459
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,050
pass  to algorithms pos how much the

460
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,700
possibility to do it at first

461
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,710
with slower algorithms and then to

462
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,300
replace them as the others

463
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,880
are implemented however they feel

464
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,950
they have to do a third round as

465
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,150
regards to contribute to this process it

466
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,010
is possible to use these algorithms

467
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,190
and  doing experiments you are in theory 1

468
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,230
when you have on the nis website download

469
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,940
the reference code of the

470
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,390
optimized code and compile it not all

471
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,020
my files are beautiful to read and

472
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,790
you can do experiments but it is a bit

473
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,850
difficult so there is a project

474
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,760
called open quantum  safe haven when it

475
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,800
makes sense in a library

476
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,020
if I remember mainly

477
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,260
licensed with that it collects  many

478
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,570
of these algorithms to a song a brunch

479
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,890
in particular which is called ninis

480
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,740
brunch where they loaded in

481
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,720
particular the exact versions sent to

482
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,690
miss that unifies the feet all these

483
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,180
schemes in order to make it more

484
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,370
accessible

485
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,320
provide rappers in c insisite initial

486
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,130
splash in python  and lingo a couple

487
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,110
of function for test bench marking to

488
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,530
measure statistics and then integrate

489
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,780
this harmless library into the same attain

490
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,300
open ssl so that if any of

491
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,490
the private servers or a

492
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,400
private infrastructure is able to

493
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,680
replace their own implementation of the

494
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,480
same works  l with this with this

495
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,880
out to test what happens if a

496
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,640
1 1 replacement flaw between the

497
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,500
present standards and possible

498
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,080
future standards microsoft also

499
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,690
fork pn works is at all the same type

500
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,250
of replacement so you can

501
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,470
verify the load on the

502
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,150
different protocol than the wider community

503
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,310
that doesn't necessarily

504
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,790
use one of those  three libraries,

505
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,530
however, you can do an

506
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,000
important job because the problem is that

507
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,210
these algorithms, while for example from

508
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,910
rsa elliptic curves we have passed,

509
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,070
the dimensions of the

510
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,080
ciphers have improved and the execution times have improved

511
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,260
and then move on to what does not

512
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,550
improve both

513
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,710
indeed in general  the algorithms may

514
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,030
be some are faster but in

515
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,100
general they are all much larger as

516
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,380
you know santech it goes from 64

517
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,310
gbyte to 2 kg by for example and therefore it

518
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,020
is not necessarily all the

519
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,460
libraries that are now present in the

520
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,770
industry also in  private settings are

521
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,600
flexible enough to

522
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,460
withstand this change for

523
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,590
example maybe the library the protocol

524
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,110
in general yes but somewhere there is a

525
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,370
buffer span of 128 bytes and there

526
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,410
the encryption must be only the

527
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,600
public key must be and these are  things that

528
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,060
you can only know who works with

529
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,520
these libraries and therefore it is very

530
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,750
interesting that

531
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,760
these queues exist  these free open implementations

532
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,320
so that you can try to

533
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,440
make these replacements already to see if

534
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,090
in the business environment this could

535
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,890
work or not or if there are

536
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,770
problems also because

537
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,060
cryptography is used everywhere so

538
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,880
it is not clear at the table especially from

539
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,590
the academic world where

540
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,360
all possible problems could succeed in a barrel line

541
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,810
and therefore it is interesting that those who

542
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,550
are in the industry can start doing

543
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,380
these things that maybe it turns out a

544
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,720
non-obvious problem but not an email

545
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,790
to the mailing list finally if someone

546
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,530
decides to do experiments they think  of

547
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,300
having discovered something interesting you

548
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,010
can obviously also publish this

549
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,430
work the principles are to send them to jesi

550
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,640
are a jesi arel

551
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,620
international association for cryptographic research

552
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,140
and they manage something

553
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,120
similar to ark and math

554
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,560
where most of the works on

555
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,540
cryptography there are workshops and

556
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,950
conferences at which you can publish  icare

557
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,410
and that they are more reviewed than christ is

558
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,780
the main one for a crypto there

559
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,970
are the workshops of nis but then there are

560
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,710
practically all the conferences now

561
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,540
give they are they manage they have to do

562
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,480
with pos quantum cryptography and if there

563
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,030
are any problems or questions  or results

564
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,410
of experiments that you do not have the time or

565
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,490
the desire to put together

566
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,770
collect a paper you can also

567
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,940
always write an email to the mailing

568
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,640
list or put the results on the site and

569
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,050
share it like

570
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,399
this all I had to say

571
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:55,550
thank you very much

572
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:03,690
