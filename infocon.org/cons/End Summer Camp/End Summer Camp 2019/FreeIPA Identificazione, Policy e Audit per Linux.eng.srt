1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
yes then as sebastiano has already introduced

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,410
me and my name is at us rebernik

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,390
which is a great name to test the

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,690
tf support of your applications i

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,790
am an embedded developer aimi

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,469
quadro which is a company from trieste and i

7
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,020
also founded mit lab let's say i am among the

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,990
The founding members are from the beginning

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,990
president as well as systems engineer because you

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,090
know that for fun you try to

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,650
avoid what you do for work

12
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,560
here evening I will tell you about free ai pm fripp

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,410
ipa is an acronym that in addition to indicating

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,989
the type of beer we have at  esc stands

15
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,260
for identity policy and or therefore

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,710
identity authenticates a user or a

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,489
service to a computer or other services

18
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,370
policy then allows you to define which

19
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,410
user and which service has access to

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,730
which computer and which audit service which

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,250
should allow you to have the list of

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,170
who accesses what and binds a little to the

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,300
top that was there a bit before but

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,680
this part here has not yet been

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,869
integrated let's say

26
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,909
the only support chiaia odit d inside the free ball  i

27
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:14,040
therefore friba is not a new software but

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,890
in truth and there are many software already well

29
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,159
known let's say packaged with a nice

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,470
bow above so we talk about itself

31
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,789
the dap which is not the usual

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,930
open the dap but it is the 38 if ds that mr

33
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,470
tod's is  the ceo that there is kerberos then

34
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,500
the mit kerberos dns server that dear

35
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,280
old bing

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,160
there is a pick up system and therefore management

37
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,680
of certificates of a certificate

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,350
authority which is dog tag which is the only

39
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,979
java software here the nice thing is that

40
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,510
all this in fact I was saying the

41
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,180
bow is that it is a whole that is

42
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,180
connected to a web interface which I must

43
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,470
say rather uses the precious

44
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,140
usable with api then you

45
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,759
then also wanting to make your

46
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,700
application that relies on

47
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,790
tripe bees has an interface of  command

48
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,229
line command which is very powerful and

49
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,390
so powerful that you can do many things

50
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,070
that you cannot do directly from the

51
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,940
web is written in python which is a good

52
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,459
plus because in our hacker space we

53
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,080
usually write so many things

54
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,520
dir  strictly in python so

55
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,400
we know them more or less all is easily

56
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,290
extensible of course again for

57
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,360
python you can make for example your

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,280
module for your object classes in

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,560
dap then to support

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,110
extra parameters in quotes and one of

61
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,459
those who did this thing  here and in

62
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:39,470
homs and it is not if I am not mistaken they

63
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,480
also use this

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,330
centralized authentication system and therefore the first part

65
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,209
that el identity provides us with the personal data

66
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,549
of the users so all the metadata of

67
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:52,010
a shell user as a directory uses posix

68
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,459
account for those who know the  dap

69
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:57,080
allows you to put who had

70
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,660
phone clouds and all the

71
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,250
nice thing and that also supports the second

72
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,200
perhaps with factor authentication that you can

73
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,250
put as an optional or a mandatory

74
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,100
therefore already mandatory at the kerberos level

75
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,780


76
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,430
let's say all the

77
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,640
authentication services and  supports both otp and

78
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,860
htp they can be activated self service

79
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,480
so trivially with an application

80
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,970
that makes you I have types  from the mobile

81
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,920
shows you from the web demonstrates lacquer cod

82
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,290
if I remember correctly it shows you the rope or

83
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,910
type in ascii art also from the

84
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,239
command line but I would not like to remember badly and

85
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,950
therefore you scandalize you are okay

86
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,080
support for groups of users among other things

87
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,470
one thing  cute that supports

88
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,000
groups are automatic groups so if

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,030
you want you can give it a reflex based on

90
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,310
various fields that you can put and then

91
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,650
when you create a new user tilo title

92
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,360
when you modify it telo

93
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,570
automatically reaches some groups

94
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,650
obviously manages the hosts that do

95
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,120
part of the i teeth team so you can

96
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,190
manage soft air all

97
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,569
or no herold it simply means

98
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:05,390
that they are known africa so they have been

99
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,250
configured with frippa so they have

100
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,630
the key kerberos year to

101
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,519
centralized publication and

102
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,019
anything else, however, it can also support

103
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,310
that even normal ross

104
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,940
in this case it supports for example the

105
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,500
signing of certificates and the resolution

106
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,298
of the dns so you put them the

107
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,540
ip address and add  ge the dns

108
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,430
ah yes in addition to this it also supports the

109
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,710
you know coutts kiss so you practically

110
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,419
then from your computer if it is well

111
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,910
configured instead of being asked at the

112
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,350
first login you accept

113
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,260
the server fingerprint blah blah blah of the

114
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,990
verification directly on the dns and

115
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,390
then  this eliminates you 66 already sure

116
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,950
that the finke hangs the right one and you are

117
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,210
wrong someone is doing

118
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,080
something wrong and then yes every host can

119
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,240
have its certificate but

120
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,759
also every service can have its

121
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,410
certificate so the model is more or

122
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,069
less what you  for each host

123
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:01,319
you can have more services that can be

124
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,770
trivial http in up to kerberos ssh rules and certificates

125
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,130
can be linked to each service

126
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,719
in this case

127
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,220
policies that are precisely the rules that

128
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,509
base hba cinquini cost based authentic

129
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:24,870
sheen control then specify who can

130
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,599
also access  service via what host

131
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,449
we say so here I can specify with

132
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:31,949
a fairly granular way I can

133
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,930
start from the single user pu  ò

134
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,000
access the single host to start the

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,190
single service that for example the thing

136
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,750
we use

137
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,580
for authentication via vpn for example

138
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,860
we have the policy that the

139
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,800
user group the members group can

140
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,900
access via the open vpn server to

141
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,970
the open pn service I can  to have

142
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,440
groups of users as in this case

143
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,690
groups of hosts also so for example

144
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,000
we have the rule again all the

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,890
useful users members can access

146
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,190
all the computer groups in the

147
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,860
machine group for by users let's say there

148
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,740
are a couple and so on  service then

149
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,370
via pam for normal login I can have the

150
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,020
centralized sud orul and then I can

151
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,670
decide which user group or

152
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,160
user can execute sudo also with what

153
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,890
commands so you have the fultz beck

154
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:31,440
let's say of lived ardis of lived of

155
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,330
the sweat of ethics  sud wells

156
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,310
directly both if you want from the

157
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,770
command line if not you are also the web from web

158
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,300
wii where you can define the various commands

159
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,560
various groups etcetera etcetera

160
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,110
all qu  esto is synchronized by a

161
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,250
daemon called sss of which now

162
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,270
at this moment I did not come up with an

163
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:55,530
acronym but we can think of

164
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,740
maximums if at least I tell you it is

165
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,030
another thing that is also very very

166
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,160
useful you have the password policies

167
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,510
therefore, based on which group or based on

168
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,220
which group the user belongs to,

169
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,220
you can define multiple policies

170
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,600
regarding the complexity and length, the

171
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,340
allowed failures and the

172
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,730
lockout period that you then impose, let's say, in the event

173
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:23,130
of an incorrect password, the services included

174
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,420
inside fi hsdpa in

175
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,830
addition to these we have already seen

176
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,270
then the basic kerberos ones

177
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,110
etcetera etc

178
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,090
the centralized auto mounts so you

179
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,910
manage centralized auto fs the typical

180
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,940
case of this thing here and

181
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,350
automatically

182
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,290
mount the halloween vmfs users' directory

183
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,020
they use the  they use kerberos to

184
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,449
connect to the nefès server and it loads

185
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:48,790
itself on the of the directory it

186
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,650
remotely directly which is a

187
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,919
rather handy thing the d  ns so you have a

188
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,830
full-fledged gui you have a gui for bing it

189
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,940
supports two multiple forwarding it

190
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,220
also supports a nice thing support

191
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,750
dynamic update of the entry so

192
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,710
if I have a computer a post that has dhcp

193
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,050
and it is rolled with free ball you can

194
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,630
enable the dns  updates then he

195
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,700
uses his kerberos key to communicate

196
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,630
with bing and update

197
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,889
the ip addresses every time he

198
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,870
pulls up

199
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,520
then we have all the management of

200
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,530
justified authority which is quite

201
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,610
complex as how it should be

202
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,979
so I can have more certificate

203
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:32,860
authority  a can I have sub cia I can

204
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,839
have new auto policy this is a

205
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:36,909
very nice thing in the sense that if I have a

206
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,950
hold software

207
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,820
I can generate the certificate with an

208
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,780
ipa command that relies on a daemon

209
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,120
and therefore practically some time

210
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,220
before the  expiration of the meaning he

211
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,350
speaks directly with filippa and

212
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,000
another certificate of

213
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,740
the same type is requested by saying but

214
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,340
they renew it t  ra the other and so convenient that

215
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,200
you from the command line then specify them

216
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,660
what command to run before and after

217
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,010
loading a new certificate so

218
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,380
in effect it is a bit like comme le

219
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,880
cinq network is the module kr a is also

220
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,990
interesting it is relatively new

221
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,740
so the web interface is a little bit

222
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,080
not the best and is practically

223
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,250
a shared password manager

224
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,920
with rather granular

225
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,760
policies where you can access secrets and this

226
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,410
and this too is quite complex

227
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,850
because it supports

228
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,980
both asymmetric and symmetrical ciphers with fish

229
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,990
archi and this we say was one of the

230
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,970
latest additions to 4.7 if I am not mistaken

231
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,950
then what can be done with confida and

232
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,970
many things at the mit lab that the laghée

233
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,380
space where we mounted this thing

234
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,630
here we use it for radio and therefore wpa2

235
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,690
enterprise is the dap out  with a whole

236
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,070
series of services in the box and one of these

237
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,910
authentication on all computers that

238
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,310
are commonly used authentication

239
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,890
through the external vpn  folders with

240
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,700
directories and then we also use it for

241
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,950
samuel

242
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,450
I don't know if any of you already know

243
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,730
sums if you want to raise your hand never

244
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,730
heard of samp okay then

245
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,020
the next slides are not really

246
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,820
thrown away

247
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,840
another very interesting thing in the

248
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,610
future we are counting  to do

249
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,080
physical access through this thing here then

250
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,820
through symmetric encryption with a

251
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,310
certificate generated by cia melo loaded

252
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,820
on my nfc card I check

253
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,280
directly with a conflict I am

254
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,610
enabled I access the place so samb le

255
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,500
stands for security assertion markup

256
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,530
language and is used exclusively

257
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,930
for single sign on it

258
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,880
usually consists of at least two

259
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,740
components, one of which is the

260
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,750
provider teeth which is what we say and

261
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,090
is responsible for authenticating the user and the

262
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,280
service and then there are service

263
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,440
providers who are then can be from

264
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,960
one an and are those that actually

265
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,970
do a useful service for

266
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,200
the user to whom the user wants to

267
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,720
access the dialogue f  it works more or less

268
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,760
like this the user agent considers the

269
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,010
resource to the service provider service

270
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,840
provider lice you need an indication

271
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,850
and I make you I redirect you all ip

272
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,280
ali di p

273
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,560
I make the clear request for

274
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,220
provider identifies me and here

275
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,000
the identification can take place

276
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,630
through many  many many many

277
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,490
different things for example the base

278
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,350
I am the passwords obviously but it can

279
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,970
also be via kerberos it can be

280
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,680
user and password with you with

281
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,350
athletic fact shaun then the provider lenses

282
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,220
returns me

283
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:48,489
an object that of substance and an xml with

284
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:51,519
all the  answer some with the fact if I

285
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,859
am enabled or not and also with

286
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:55,600
all my metadata that are used for login

287
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,729
metadata that are requested, let's say

288
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:59,859
by the service provider so the most

289
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:03,999
trivial things are the username, the email and the

290
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:06,039
groups to which it belongs and

291
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:09,309
therefore  with this thing here the service

292
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,789
provider authenticates me checks mind there is

293
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:15,759
a senator cell to check if they

294
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,889
are if all goes well gives me access  I know to the

295
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:22,089
resource this this function such

296
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:24,009
samuele is not part of the frippa agreement

297
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,309
but it is another software called y

298
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:29,009
which is also written in python

299
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:32,339
always uses ssd backhanders it

300
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,449
supported the application both

301
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:40,149
via password forum kerberos starts

302
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:41,949
and essentially  this let's say a

303
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:43,479
configuration interface

304
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:47,880
I have my various login plugins plug ins

305
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,700
info the teeth of this we see it

306
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,910
very soon but the problem is that as

307
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,080
good nerds we want to try to

308
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,720
minimize the interaction with users

309
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,040
even in the case of hacker space  and

310
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,500
so we need a way to

311
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,090
activate new accounts in a

312
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,279
relatively easy,

313
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,740
relatively secure way and here

314
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,980
a project called mochi came up and

315
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,129
is basically a self service panel

316
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:17,810
for fripp used by if i am not mistaken

317
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,399
the university of ca  somewhere in

318
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,009
california i think it supports both the

319
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:24,749
activations of new accounts which by

320
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:27,180
the way works differently

321
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,499
once it was prettier  because from the

322
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:30,360
command line I could activate a new account he

323
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,480
sent his e-mail asked for the average

324
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,069
activation

325
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:39,240
finished the stone battery yes

326
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,990
essentially sent the average activation

327
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,699
then to the user who could create the

328
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,319
password to go away now this

329
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:47,999
this continuity which sometimes not  I know

330
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,189
well because they support the

331
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:54,540
direct registration on the portal not only is used

332
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,189
for creating the first users but

333
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:01,199
also works as a self service panel

334
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,050
because many times the

335
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,670
normal tripe panel is not particularly

336
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,300
user friendly so from here you can

337
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,879
manage your tokens  otp you can manage two

338
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,300
ssh keys and also the

339
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,649
customizable templates and then you can do it

340
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:21,540
let's say show how you want as a

341
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,160
bonus then let's also put them but

342
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,470
key and then can also send the

343
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,809
signed emails in c pc and now if the god

344
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:33,059
of demos shows you  he will smile

345
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:35,399
I will show you here this is how much what we

346
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,410
say can be seen from the

347
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,940
main interface so here

348
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,290
I see the  active users I now

349
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,730
activated a filter to avoid

350
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,089
linking too much information and you

351
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:46,470
only see my account

352
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,550
this is the view as an administrator

353
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,490
so these are all the various fields you

354
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,199
can see particularly well they

355
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:03,449
seem to me two arms here we are so

356
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:06,029
let's say all the basic metadata  that one

357
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:08,640
can insert in the dap

358
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,400
certified ssh keys here I can

359
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,350
select here if we say if I

360
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,310
put it as mandatory this here

361
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,470
you do not have to log in via the

362
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,430
second ancient shaun

363
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,360
phone address and anything else

364
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,750
then I have so these are all the list

365
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,900
of all the hosts let's open one at random

366
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,450
ok metadata class description here

367
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,100
are more or less things you can write

368
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,360
then manage yours let's say according to

369
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,130
internal policies

370
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,260
then add the mac address to all ssh keys

371
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,090
if we take a poster

372
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:59,160
roller this here then  if on the road here

373
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,700
you see cell that is true ski present and

374
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,540
therefore this here and let's say po can do

375
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,890
all the things of renewing the

376
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,420
certificates and anything else services here in

377
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,670
essence is very similar to

378
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,560
what we have seen before so

379
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,660
this are all http services to

380
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,020
enterprise and therefore this is quite

381
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,750
similar there are certificates present I

382
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,150
see them here foscari I can

383
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,740
obviously download only certificate not the

384
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,980
key  private groups as we said

385
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,890
and these are instead the rules for

386
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,890
example the rules

387
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,600
here we are this is an example so

388
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,170
all the machines that have the effect of

389
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,020
n which ends in 5h kumite labor go

390
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,280
to the group of machines in a

391
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,520
in the office 5 for  example the most

392
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,090
interesting part so the rules are

393
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,030
what was said before to the member from the pm

394
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,790
therefore quite direct as

395
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,119
user groups members access interface

396
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,920
in which it comes via service open pn

397
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,359
nice simple you can't go wrong

398
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,510
sudo rules this let's say the simplest

399
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,930


400
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,349
in essence granta  the administrators the

401
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,310
domain on all the

402
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,579
moving machines even here

403
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,760
the password policies of  to which we

404
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,020
said

405
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,050
before these are also quite direct

406
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,300
so for example here the nice thing and

407
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,630
the priority speech you

408
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,730
can see if therefore priority in essence

409
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,330
I can

410
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,669
sort my password policies then

411
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:50,289
based on what is crazy there  a user who

412
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:52,820
would belong to two pass policies wins the

413
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,279
one with the highest lowest prior

414
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,899
sorry for the things I can define

415
00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:05,350
cuasso ops what I can define in the

416
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,220
maximum m life then force to change

417
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,090
the password min life times this is to

418
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,039
avoid many changes of  passwords one of the

419
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:19,340
other this is to avoid the

420
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,769
last hicks password to prevent also

421
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,570
the user let's say he has two

422
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,149
constantly expensive exchange passwords that I

423
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:27,380
played last to limit the

424
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,639
complexity of the password

425
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:31,789
mi langues max failures son reset

426
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:34,600
query of the opt out

427
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:43,250
ok here  are the eyes p if someone

428
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,710
registers a token a one time password

429
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,049
if they see it here

430
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:49,629
then this is the automatic I told you

431
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,539
this is the format of  right let

432
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:56,019
's say here about this is what one would

433
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,999
write in his in his auto file is

434
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:58,409
fess

435
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:01,600
this we say asterisk then this

436
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,739
world to all passwords

437
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:07,330
all folders inside the sum with

438
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,730
this with these arguments here

439
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,389
this sex carabi sex caparelli 5p

440
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:17,289
defines me the  login via kerberos to

441
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:22,809
the nefès service these instead are the

442
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:28,720
areas of our so normal panel

443
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,279
these are all the entries

444
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:33,090
here is that one thing you will notice if you have

445
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,649
from the free pass network are really

446
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:37,869
many srv entries as regards the

447
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:46,629
tripe configuration and then good

448
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:49,619
shop I wanted  show you one more thing

449
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:54,269
then there is a connection

450
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,049
ok then another bonus

451
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:03,100
another bonus slide that I had

452
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:09,639
prepared and this free to support

453
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:10,629
automatic application

454
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:13,190
so I can install

455
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,920
n the free pa replicas

456
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,560
synchronize with each other with  the dap of the

457
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,920
doubs so let's say in an encrypted way in

458
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,480
fact they already say the installation

459
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,400
they tell you we recommend having at least

460
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,370
two kings  pliche

461
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,630
therefore to act as let's say

462
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,490
both failover and synchronization I can

463
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,950
have the system supports multiple replicas

464
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,920
in multiple geographical locations which are

465
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,090
ipa locations

466
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,920
this because to try to optimize

467
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,540
and drive the clients a little towards

468
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,850
the domain let's say the closest server

469
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,530
so if I have a company here it is

470
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,510
a company in Milan and I am connected

471
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,820
through a vpn to be all

472
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,530
in the same network or two

473
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,850
replicas here to two replicas of it I

474
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,500
prefer that the clients of

475
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,870
Trieste speak with the server than in

476
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,850
Trieste  he does not conserve that in milan so

477
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,750
this thing here is done via dns

478
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,670
so by setting the correct dns records

479
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,430
he prefers the local one to the remote one

480
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,550


481
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,280
here we are

482
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,440
just to understand who also does all

483
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,900
these beautiful things the cin animations

484
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,770
in javascript these are the

485
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,420
application agreements in  substance every

486
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,230
this arrow the arrow the

487
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,720
orange arrow tells me that there is one there is an

488
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,390
application of the dns and the nearby blue

489
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,630
m  i says that there is a certification replication of

490
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,490
the certificate authority

491
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,510
as I said the bees are very nice they

492
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,670
are documented available

493
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,320
directly in the browser

494
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,110
so I for each for each key I can

495
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,370
see all the options that can

496
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,540
put them etcetera etcetera

497
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,490
and this is more or less one

498
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,930
complete overview thank you

499
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,050
if anyone has any questions about please

500
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:47,850
I don't know if there is someone with the microphone and it

501
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:54,910
arrives I repeated arrived bye first

502
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,780
I was talking about the cra and then to the

503
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,610
sharing of passwords and so

504
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,200
on I wanted a moment to understand if he

505
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,690
had already tested it and fin  where can you

506
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,430
go to limit access to a

507
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,070
certain password to user groups or

508
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,130
users and then I ask you below for

509
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,460
the attack immediately I saw on the stand

510
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,190
roller you showed earlier that there was

511
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,710
a one time password option if you do not

512
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,290
mention if  then explain it as

513
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,390
regards the deposit we have not

514
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,570
really tested it because from a

515
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,670
quick check and it seemed quite complex,

516
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,610
he said  r now we do not need it so

517
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,990
urgently because we have another

518
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,790
system regarding the noc of the

519
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,950
mit lab which by the way I recommend it is

520
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,879
called

521
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:46,369
cobas knows it is so nice enough

522
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:47,869
let's say to share share

523
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:51,169
simple enough so yes

524
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:52,429
we have not seen it anymore  from time to time the

525
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:56,599
biggest problem in truth is that it

526
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,609
is a bit of a limitation and that you must

527
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:01,489
be working only its stand road that is it

528
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:03,799
must have installed on your pc

529
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,659
you must do it must have the kerberos

530
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:10,339
ripa ticket so for example on its six it does not

531
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:12,859
run  very well the client so that

532
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:16,099
was already a limitation if however

533
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:18,679
from what I had seen 6 then

534
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:20,089
limit enough that is you can have a

535
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:21,679
control for single groups even for

536
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,690
users if I was not that is everyone can have

537
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,269
their own turn and then there is the type of  faces

538
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:27,979
that can be symmetrical symmetrical and

539
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:32,029
then celiac lx for the time but I'm

540
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:33,949
saying when when I saw it

541
00:24:33,949 --> 00:24:35,869
I don't know if there were I don't think there were

542
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:38,479
further developments me  ntre the oti pickett

543
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:42,229
udc is used to make the en roll mens then

544
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:45,949
practically on the roll mendy new hosts

545
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:48,489
you can do them either directly

546
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:51,079
through the dns autoconfiguration

547
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:54,229
all authentic let's say he takes

548
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:57,109
the ticket you put your password

549
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:59,839
or at least a password of a user  who

550
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,289
has the permissions to reach host and he

551
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:04,639
does the communication or the other

552
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:07,639
alternative that avoids you this I would like to

553
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:11,989
write the password and generate a one

554
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:13,429
time password there then add the

555
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,769
lost first we generate a one time

556
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:17,850
password and then copy it on the

557
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,299
lost that  you want to add and tell her

558
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,070
one time password and then he uses that

559
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,510
instead of making the indication with yours

560
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:27,630
with your low isone is perhaps a little

561
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,470
safer to avoid authenticating other

562
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,650
questions

563
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,350
according to no good then a

564
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:45,940
round of applause for aliases thanks to the app

565
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,019
[Applause  ]
