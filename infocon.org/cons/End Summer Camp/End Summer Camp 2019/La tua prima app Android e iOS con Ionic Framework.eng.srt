1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
ok well found everyone as we mentioned

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,950
before the intervention will talk about yorick

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,800
framework and in particular how to create

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,969
a simple application for smartphone

5
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:18,000
or tablet on android and ios platform

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,490


7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,960
i am andrea maybe you have seen in

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,840
some other talk i am involved in

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,160
software development including also

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,669
mobile applications computer forensics other things and

11
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:34,170
this is a relatively simple talk

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,790
because it wants to introduce to ionic

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,579
framework so let's say a first

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,010
use to make a

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,840
fairly basic application to ion framework in

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,260
reality it contrasts the native development

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,199
of applications that the

18
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,719
classic quoted methodology with which  it

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,079
started out mobile applications and

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,090
native development what provides that we are

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,809
going to write the code of an app

22
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:05,909
using the language and

23
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,040
development environments that are provided by the

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,110
manufacturers of the operating system then

25
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,310
google and apple and then to make an

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,580
application both on  android i know i

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,770
should write the codic  and in two

28
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,259
different languages using

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,869
different development environments and also the

30
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,670
tools to design graphical

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,470
interfaces that are different this

32
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,000
first of all c from the advantage that

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,790
we can make any type of app

34
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,780
we can make very

35
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,570
simple applications we can also make

36
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,610
very complicated applications that

37
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,009
use three-dimensional graphics  that use

38
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,509
all the functionalities of the

39
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,140
operating system even at a low level but in

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,909
reality if we then go and see

41
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,590
what the reality of

42
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,420
applications is as well as what

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,520
customers ask us when we develop

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,979
applications for them, it is that

45
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,409
most of the asp that  found

46
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,130
around are not particularly complex

47
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,530
are applications that connect to a

48
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,080
web service

49
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,850
they make you log in they make you

50
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,180
register they show your

51
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,950
user profile they show you

52
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,210
information and little

53
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,890
else video games maybe with 3d graphics

54
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,740
etc. are a little different  however,

55
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,540
most of the applications  the normals

56
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,630
let's say show data and create a

57
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,310
profile is more or less always

58
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,100
those things so they do not exploit

59
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,080
all the functions of

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,450
the mobile system at a low level

61
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,200
so it is a bit of a waste in quotation marks to

62
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,209
develop them natively then here

63
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,070
the development of so-called is opposed

64
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,440
hybrid in our case we see yorick

65
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,800
framework which is actually composed of

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,700
different parts is based on angle and

67
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,520
córdova angular is a

68
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,840
web development framework based on java script

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,330
or type script and which we say is

70
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,640
also used to develop

71
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,980
so-called richard applications and

72
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,519
things like that

73
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,820
so we strongly use javascript and

74
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,519
córdova instead is a series of

75
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,670
tools library developed mainly by

76
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,709
adobe to create hybrid mobile applications

77
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,910
so in practice it

78
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,110
basically has the up becomes a

79
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,480
kind of web view video a browser

80
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,850
without a bar with nothing in which you see

81
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,430
only  an html and javascript page

82
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,739
inside that has the same graphics as

83
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,019
another one  rnative the same functions of an

84
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,730
operational but in reality it is made with

85
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,540
web technology

86
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,200
in addition to this code and then also

87
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,440
ionic provide plugins that

88
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,920
allow you to abstract the interaction with

89
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,140
the mobile platform because maybe they

90
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,489
give you a plugin to show

91
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:06,410
notifications that  then he developed

92
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,269
natively for both ios and android

93
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,370
to recall the function in javascript it is

94
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,810
he according to the platform he is

95
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,090
using he allows you to show a

96
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,220
notification but you write it only once

97
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,130


98
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,360
he then executes it as he must follow it

99
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,890
so what allows us to

100
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,300
doing allows us to develop faster

101
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,640
because we write the code

102
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,870
only once and we can have, let's say, an

103
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,700
output on two different platforms, we

104
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,180
save time and depending on the type

105
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,920
of app we want to make we save

106
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,480
time also because sometimes it is

107
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,270
easier to comply with the  requests of the

108
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,030
graph when you have to do something in itself

109
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,200
ss

110
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,480
instead of doing the native with the

111
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,330
tools you f  it adorns android studio

112
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,570
or xcode to draw the elements

113
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,340
on the screen sometimes simpler to do it

114
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,740
in css so if it asks you it will have the

115
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,540
button that to that color with the

116
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,120
gradient at that edge etc. with css

117
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,300
you first respect fano native and then

118
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,620
ionic in particular respect  for

119
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,500
example use córdova or phonegap also

120
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,390
that the name of adobe to develop

121
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,340
apps tt also gives more tools

122
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,780
there is a more practical command line interface

123
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,240
and some automatisms

124
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,130
think for example the icons for each

125
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,320
platform to the screen set studios was  and

126
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,910
automate bild process which is a

127
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,770
little more practical than pure córdova

128
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,410
so to get started in our app

129
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,600
we need to install some

130
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,390
development tools first

131
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,660
through the package manager we

132
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,350
install ionic and córdova on our

133
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,390
system

134
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,190
after which we can use a pleasure

135
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,560
of course since then we go to

136
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,380
work in time script it might be

137
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,300
advisable to use visual studio cod

138
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,280
pe  because it has excellent support for the

139
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,830
times script language and therefore it is very

140
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,890
comfortable but it can also be at home

141
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,810
if one wants to get hurt it can also be

142
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,570
note quad punto exe anyway any

143
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,220
software that allows you to write

144
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,440
text files

145
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,350
after which

146
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,030
we must keep in mind  however that when

147
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,590
we go in January the prefecture

148
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,960
mind we use the

149
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,130
native development tools even if we do not use them

150
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,330
directly but we

151
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,280
have to install them so for android I can

152
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,780
use linux windows mac os and I just

153
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,210
need android studio while if I want to

154
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,290
create an app  that then it can actually be

155
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,960
installed on the iphone or ipad

156
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,510
I need a computer with

157
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,210
mac os and ex cod installed

158
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,910
so on android you can export

159
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,820
all platforms and while the

160
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,580
final export for ios needs an

161
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,790
apple computer as an example for  this

162
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,090
presentation I just thought of

163
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,260
trying to do something quite

164
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,130
simple and then the idea was let's make

165
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,550
an app for smartphones that t  i can

166
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,520
see a list of the titles of all the

167
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,350
talks that are at esc this year,

168
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,290
taking them from the week, in short, if

169
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,710
a list of talks and then with

170
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,810
pen and paper I drew this thing then I

171
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,280
redid it in

172
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,440
vector  idea was to make two screenshots the first

173
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,600
is a sort of home page where there

174
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,210
are cards with

175
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,190
a photo we will put some photos at random

176
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,160
because there are no talk photos and you

177
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,550
see the talk code in small and the

178
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:59,370
title code title  while the

179
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,979
detail screen will have the codes a little

180
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,410
larger the title here is not clearly visible

181
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,389
however the green color

182
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:11,430
the name of the speaker day and time and

183
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,090
then always a photograph then now

184
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,669
practically I will show you how you can

185
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,310
do this job starting  from the

186
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,599
skeleton of the project

187
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,240
another advantage of a ionic is that it already has

188
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,099
the skeletons we are already made and therefore

189
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,630
we can simply give the command

190
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,870
ionic start we put the name of

191
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,969
our application that I have called

192
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:40,589
bait up and the name instead d  the template of

193
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:43,260
a ionic in our case is called blank

194
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,470
because precisely to a screen with a

195
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,740
sort of and the world without anything then there is

196
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,630
also the template already with the other

197
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,089
things tab but as a basic starting point we start

198
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:58,890
from the white template then starting from

199
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,570
colors that can be seen both in the

200
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,589
esc logo and on the site I set two

201
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:07,980
colors 1 primary that the green a little

202
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,860
darker and the secondary that to the

203
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,550
light green using this also a

204
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,709
very convenient ionic tool

205
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:19,380
the bionic color generator which

206
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,970
then  the imposed two three colors that I

207
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,480
need

208
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,310
he makes me all the variants of

209
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,070
chiaroscuro etcetera etcetera and gives me a

210
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,480
code in them css then in sas and I

211
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,180
go to replace it in the file that already has the

212
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,560
default colors that would be blue

213
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,510
all the  shades of blue I take the

214
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,400
file that was already existing it replaces it

215
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,750
with the code that gave me

216
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,490
color generator and magically the application

217
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,560
changes the theme at this point the only

218
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,810
little stuff to fix on the t  emplate

219
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,300
by default is the status bar on android

220
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,190
because it does not work correctly in the

221
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,410
sense that if I launch the

222
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,020
default ionic template the status bar at the top

223
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,200
will have a black background and the writing is black

224
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,580
so it is not exactly very readable

225
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,620
but in this case while  on ios the

226
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,060
status bar to the transparent background

227
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,920
so it takes the color of the app bar

228
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,540


229
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,630
in this case I check if the

230
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,420
platform and android set the color

231
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,110
that I told him with light green

232
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:31,830
you see that in both cases as I

233
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:36,570
put the style  by default which means

234
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,370
that it has dark writing because I know that the

235
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,470
background of the bar is very light if

236
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,910
instead I wanted to use a more

237
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,690
flamboyant color put the white writing

238
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,870
I would have had to put style light content

239
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,940
it seems to me so it is just to keep

240
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,370
this thing in mind  most of the

241
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,660
apps on android have a

242
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,340
bright color then the white writing on the

243
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,480
status quark anyway that's all in short

244
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,580
I created the project I changed the

245
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,250
colors I have not done anything else if I

246
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,400
now

247
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,180
wanted to put the title

248
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,860
in it I practically go to modify the first page

249
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,699
created by the template and in the meantime I put a

250
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:20,999
prettier color on the toolbar and then

251
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:24,499
I put the title I want I go out 2019

252
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:27,930
is simply with a ions that launched

253
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,480
ion chord true in the name of the

254
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,809
platform so if I have an apple computer

255
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:34,559


256
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,839
I can also put ios and launch the

257
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,579
simulator of them otherwise they

258
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:41,790
have to force android and at this

259
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,290
point what I have generated is

260
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,589
an application that unfortunately perhaps

261
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:47,939
you do not see much here  good for the contrast it

262
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:49,680
is very high but the bar at the top is a

263
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,220
light green with black writing and then

264
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,529
on the white page with the

265
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:56,550
default download because I have not even

266
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,389
changed it for the moment this is the

267
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:02,069
first launch practically changing only

268
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:06,269
colors  and the title at this point I'm going to

269
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,970
create a homepage without data yet but

270
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,649
only with the graphic aspect that it

271
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:13,350
will then have at the end so I prepare a mock  up

272
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,689
without putting any real information into it

273
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:19,850
and I modify the home file by

274
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,199
changing the content using the

275
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,610
components you have or nick

276
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,529
gives me because this is also

277
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:26,939
another advantage of joniche that

278
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:29,339
gives me the angular components already made

279
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,129
so there is the component for the  card

280
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:35,600
where I put an image I put a header

281
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,180
with a subtitle it is a title I create 2

282
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,649
just because I want to see the effect

283
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:42,839
it does with two cards

284
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,000
at this point simply modifying the

285
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,449
code so I relaunch it again

286
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:50,459
relaunching it we begin to see a

287
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,449
structure a  a little more serious in the sense that

288
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:57,089
there are two cards with two

289
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:01,529
random photographs, let's say it is the space where

290
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:03,120
I will insert the title of the tour this

291
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,740
looks more or less like the one I had

292
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,629
drawn before as a draft

293
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:11,009
interface so we always pass

294
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:12,660
a draft of the interface of the

295
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,850
detail page

296
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,259
you must first generate

297
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:18,540
another page as you do with the

298
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,309
command a joniche g

299
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:23,169
page di te detail is the name c  he

300
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,149
I chose and it is at your pleasure, in short,

301
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,759
then knowing that the default address

302
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,569
where the page will go is slash companies

303
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:35,619
because it is the one on the cards of the home

304
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:38,169
page I go to insert a link so that

305
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:40,839
when I touch the card with my finger

306
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:43,989
go to the other page and how

307
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,119
the transition does it using a transition that

308
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:47,859
manages jonica depending on the

309
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:50,019
platform it will use the graphic effect that

310
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:51,399
the user expects on that

311
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,229
platform then on ios he will see the

312
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:55,299
page that exits from the right side to the

313
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:57,339
left on android  instead from the bottom

314
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:00,359
up faster

315
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:03,999
and at this point I create the mockup instead

316
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:06,220
of the detail page in this case

317
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,829
what practically an image at the top

318
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:12,860
a section with a bit of

319
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,620
padang and of the writings the writing a bit

320
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,170
smaller code the writing with the

321
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,060
big title of the talk and then the speaker is the

322
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,000
date and time I go again to

323
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,530
relaunch the application also in

324
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,150
this case I don't have the real data for the

325
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,560
moment I'm just doing a

326
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,280
graphic draft and  I get this

327
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,260
detail screen then we would have to translate the

328
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,250
back button on ios pro

329
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,110
let's forget that however there is the photo and there

330
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,300
are the writings underneath that maybe you do not

331
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,520
see very well but trust in short

332
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,930
that there are at this point but what

333
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,670
I have  done I made the graphical interface

334
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,760
of the app when there is data because

335
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,070
so far I have not put anything in it then

336
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,990
we must also take care of entering the

337
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:06,020
data for this reason I have to worry

338
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,590
about fishing them from the bait site you know

339
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,690
well that on the eastern c  'is a

340
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,580
page where there is a list of talk

341
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,480
shows, times and there are

342
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,760
headings with the next day there

343
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,230
are tables with talks and then there is

344
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,700
another heading with another day and

345
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,880
so on

346
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,560
first of all I create a  a class that

347
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,480
defines me the type of object

348
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,910
I want to work with and for simplicity they are

349
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,490
all sting and therefore more for

350
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,850
organization because we do not have

351
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,920
a data source for example that

352
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,900
provides us with a sex h  year something that

353
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,610
is structured we only have one table

354
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,950
to read and then we do all

355
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,340
strings for the moment so code

356
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,180
speaker title date is meant as

357
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,790
day and time so I put the fields

358
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,210
I want in my class and then I go to

359
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,550
write a code that I go to  download

360
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,790
these data from the bait site

361
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,470
and create all these toll-type objects for me

362
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,080
but there is a small problem to take

363
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,910
into account

364
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,560
as I am working on a site that

365
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,870
is not mine by default when I make

366
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,000
a request to a page in https  or in

367
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,050
any case the web page from the browser or

368
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,890
even from the web views of cordova

369
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,740
we know that the browser

370
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,840
checks if the site I am calling

371
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,280
authorizes me to take its content

372
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,900
not so much because it wants to respect the

373
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,490
will of the site but more than anything else because

374
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,590
to prevent one  insert

375
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,400
malicious code from third pages in reality and

376
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,950
check if it is allowed in this case

377
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,930
as we have not got our hands on

378
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,380
the bait site where, however, we do not  no

379
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,690
access so there is no this

380
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,120
authorization default would block

381
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,770
practically so my code would not

382
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,319
be able to read the data but

383
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,020
fortunately they made a

384
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,160
native plugin for ai or nick

385
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,839
that makes the requests that of

386
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,410
tp not through the uai river directly

387
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,000
from  'application with native code

388
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,400
for the various platforms so in

389
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,050
this case the simplest thing to

390
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,050
install the plugin is to just give those

391
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,000
three commands and then follow the instructions

392
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,060
that you insert two lines of code

393
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,170
at that point all the calls

394
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,000
work so keep in

395
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,500
consider that when you

396
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,480
also do the tests if you do them on the browser, for

397
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,420
example, they can give problems

398
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,960
at this point instead I create a

399
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,600
so-called service service, that is a piece of

400
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,140
code that deals with managing data, be

401
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,370
careful not to think that it is like a

402
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,440
service type  those of linux that are

403
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,210
always in constant execution because it

404
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,800
is not exactly the same thing

405
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,720
we say that the service is a  a

406
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,450
data structure that I share among all the various

407
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,950
pages and I can call up when I want

408
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,450
so you can imitate it in the pages

409
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,080
you need and

410
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,909
to the first we say the first page

411
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:15,340
that calls it the service is

412
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,840
initialized if there was no

413
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,390
page that calls it  the service

414
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:23,200
should not even be created at this point we

415
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,510
implement the download of the tops I do not

416
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,429
go to read all the code because

417
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:29,230
what it does is practically read it

418
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,649
html is a bit boring because

419
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:34,899
we do not have a well-defined structure if

420
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:36,760
you then want to deepen you will see it in the

421
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,980
slides anyway essentially  connects

422
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,130
to the page I go to interpret

423
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,799
the titles and tables in order every time

424
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,480
he reads a title updates the fact

425
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,159
that that is the current date

426
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:49,330
every time he reads the row of a

427
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,970
table check if there is a dash in the code it

428
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,960
wants  say that probably

429
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,519
that line was not filled

430
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:57,549
then skip it otherwise you create a

431
00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:00,789
new object of type talk and lo  adds

432
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:02,710
to its data structure the only

433
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,000
important thing is the two sides at the top

434
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,809
practically what two variables two fields

435
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:14,710
of the class the first is a dictionary

436
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,470
then a table that connects

437
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,860
the talk code with the element of type

438
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,269
remove and then I  I can go to

439
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:25,149
read based on the code and the second instead is

440
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:28,360
a list that simply keeps

441
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,000
track of the order of the talks so that

442
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,429
when I show the talks on the home

443
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:36,399
page they see them in the correct order

444
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:38,740
because the tables the hashmats do not have

445
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,320
an order well so let's say that

446
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,460
now I have downloaded the data and

447
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,380
entered them in the service it does it

448
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,960
asynchronously let's say the part then

449
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,149
service connects makes its call that tdp

450
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,820
calmly when it has finished populate the

451
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,519
variables and will have the talks and the

452
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,740
then what should I do now I have to

453
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,630
use the service to get the data

454
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,110
that I will then show to the user then

455
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,330
I modify the home page type script

456
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:18,449
and expose

457
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,500
the two variables with two getters  that I need

458
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,750
so I make a getter for the

459
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,890
rungger list for the talk and in the constructor

460
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,630
but I must have called data service

461
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,870
otherwise it would not know what it is

462
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:40,120
at that point I modify the file in html

463
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,590
with the cards before he had put two of them

464
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,960
by copying and pasting the  code right

465
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,720
now I remove one of the two I

466
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,250
simply use only one but you see

467
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,150
that there is a command that is asterisk angie

468
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,350
for that is practically a loop where

469
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:03,430
I call the list and tell it that each

470
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,740
element of the lists you have to call

471
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,470
code then led tail  flat and then

472
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,750
I am going to insert that code with double

473
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,460
curly brackets inside the

474
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,780
template so if there are 10 talks that

475
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,970
code is repeated ten times each

476
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:24,040
time changing the code is also the

477
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,740
link modified so that it no

478
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,510
longer calls detail  and that's it but call

479
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,150
detail bar the talk code and I

480
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,770
need it because then on the other side

481
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,900
I intercept that code and go to

482
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,750
show what I want to show

483
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,330
change subtitle  I change the title

484
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,570
this is the modification of the home page

485
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,280
after which I am going to modify the

486
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,260
detail page instead as I told you a

487
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,390
moment ago I have to modify the false

488
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,070
detail to read the code

489
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,380
I just passed them so you have to

490
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,870
change the route and put a

491
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,760
placeholder on it  that I called to tell him

492
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,429
to angular look that

493
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:08,619
the requests that come to you on the bar of

494
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:12,100
you the bar and another piece of string

495
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,980
you have to map them on the detail page

496
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,409
otherwise it no longer worked

497
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:20,200
and then in the detail page we have to

498
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,580
put a server that checks every

499
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,110
time  that the code is updated

500
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,059
because angular could also decide

501
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:29,799
that the page in the reuse for

502
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,480
several times without destroying to recreate

503
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,429
every time so we must

504
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:34,720
always be reactive to when

505
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,580
the code is updated

506
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,110
just put an observer every time

507
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,460
the code is updated

508
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,649
we update it in the  our internal page

509
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:46,769
and created a method that returns the talk

510
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:50,919
to the street  w instead there is the page that

511
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,740
tml that shows the data because that

512
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,779
last getter there I need so that the

513
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,789
html page can access a

514
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:00,460
variable called toghe

515
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,860
at this point suitable precisely the

516
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,860
html page and therefore in the page I always show it

517
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,190
a  'image generated

518
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,749
somehow based on the code and putting an iv

519
00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:16,179
because in a few moments that

520
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:17,710
variable li could be nothing

521
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,840
so better hide everything until the

522
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,940
talk has been loaded when it has been

523
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,919
loaded I show the code and then there are

524
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:28,480
a few lines  that I have not copied but it

525
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,159
always shows all the data of the talk

526
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,960
then speaker title etc. etc.

527
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,879


528
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:42,460


529
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,499


530
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:46,629


531
00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:50,230
however they

532
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,789
are quite simple steps

533
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:54,789
that are described in the wiki of a

534
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:58,749
ions that you can consult it however in the

535
00:23:58,749 --> 00:24:00,789
meantime we can still generate u  n

536
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:05,259
further build in this case the

537
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:07,210
project parameter is a parameter of

538
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,499
angular that tells it to

539
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:09,850
package all the files inside the

540
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,730
application while at the

541
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,259
android level this is still considered

542
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:17,049
a build the bug is however we have

543
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:18,549
generated our package which then

544
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:19,160
we can

545
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,310
clear on the smartphone or

546
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,560
continue to see in the simulator

547
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,110
let's try to see what came out

548
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,660
this is the final result of the

549
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,490
application then on the left

550
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,330
you see the home on the two platforms

551
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,850
I see the list of the top this list is

552
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,200
now not quite complete because it has

553
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,550
been made  Sunday afternoon while

554
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,920
the page is still evolving

555
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,110
so not all will be

556
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,520
published

557
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,700
if I touch one of the

558
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,810
cards the detail page opens and on

559
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,390
the detail page I actually see

560
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:02,030
the data with the code the speaker title

561
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,330
date and time slot  so exactly

562
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,500
the data fished from the page this

563
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,710
concludes the example of course there is from

564
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,930
d  ire that the app needs to refine it

565
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,310
a little better for example every time

566
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,380
I launch the app this data

567
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,390
dump again if it is not connected at

568
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,340
that moment it makes an attempt then

569
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,310
it is enough that is not that so if they are not

570
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,930
connected cool when I have

571
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,000
the app the app shows white screen is

572
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,080
over there

573
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,000
so we should implement the

574
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,500
store is already that obviously it is a

575
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,690
next step so I advise you

576
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,190
to read the documentation on the store it

577
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,630
is also the strange is quite simple

578
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:49,100
because a  jonica córdova they give me

579
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,590
modules to have storage and save

580
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,870
my objects reload them when I need them

581
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,900
then persistence etc. then take

582
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,670
into account if the connected mobile phone

583
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,190
promotes a cycle that every few minutes

584
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,010
maybe reloads the data anyway are

585
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,050
all things that can be added and

586
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:11,370
who  it is curious can try to do then

587
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,960
I have not spoken to you for example of the branding

588
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,980
that is the application in addition to having the

589
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,480
code of course that you see with the

590
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,550
matches anc  he an initial part in which

591
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,320
there is the user who touches the icon the icon

592
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,450
must be drawn in order not to have

593
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,290
the bionic default one and on android there is

594
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,090
also a particular format to have

595
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,540
the animated icons and yet here too there is  'it's

596
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,760
very simple you make a couple of

597
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,809
different pngs and then you run a command that

598
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:42,030
cordova renders that generates the resources

599
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,650
for all platforms for all

600
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,870
sizes that are required

601
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,400
the same thing also for the splash

602
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,170
screen you start from an image  unique and

603
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,520
then there is a command that automatically

604
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,860
generates all the variants you need

605
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,840
because there is a variant of the splash

606
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,770
screen for the ipad

607
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,270
a variant for the iphone etcetera

608
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,490
etcetera and it does it all automatically if

609
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,580
we give as input a  jpeg png file

610
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,950
with space screen this is not an

611
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,500
aspect that I have dealt with today but in any case

612
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,260
if you go and see the example

613
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,290
you can find it in fact I have put

614
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,610
online the slides of this presentation

615
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,270
the pre-compiled pick up that you can

616
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,730
download if you trust  s  load

617
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,640
apk because of the web obviously and install

618
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,910
on your smartphone

619
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,710
to install it had to

620
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,190
activate unknown sources and or adb

621
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,130
if you use the computer to install it and

622
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:42,240
put a repository online on a tab

623
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,430
where you can find

624
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,570
the code of the application so far

625
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,730
treated with these  functionality

626
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:57,070
if you want to try to extend it to

627
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:01,840
make changes for example

628
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,890
well by tomorrow at noon if

629
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,930
someone let's say the first three that

630
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,520
modify the app to show the

631
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,890
description of the talks and in addition to the title

632
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:17,320
and time offers the brewer so you can

633
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,770
try and then  you download the app you have

634
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,850
already made the change and in the display

635
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,980
more or less this was all of it then

636
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,030
I think that sebastiano sebastiano perhaps had to

637
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,030
say something in the

638
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,160
meantime I think there is still a few

639
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,000
minutes 5 minutes for any questions or

640
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:50,280
curiosities there is someone please

641
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,909
always feels great there is a way to

642
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:02,520
create environments for example

643
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,850
development and production just to

644
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,890
change the links to  where you connect the app

645
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:12,029
to have mockups right is yes on

646
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:15,720
angular especially if this thing

647
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,080
practically me when I first put the

648
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,760
command there was the last command I

649
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,529
showed it was less less prod

650
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:25,500
because in reality on corner you can have

651
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,250
a file called environment dot

652
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,649
ts that puts inside a

653
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:36,179
very normal dictionary and environment dot ts

654
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,789
environment dot prode dot ts

655
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:40,380
automatically depending on the picture you make

656
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,169
takes one of the two so you can have a

657
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:45,529
different oral for the production for

658
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:48,919
the development
