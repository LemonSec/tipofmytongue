1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,970
hello i guess you all know star

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,639
trek i don't think it needs

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,410
big introductions

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,099
sci-fi franchise includes tv series movies

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:16,580
prequel sequel reboot and anything else

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,990
describes the future of humanity in a

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,050
remote future and there are several

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,699
fantastic

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,279
sci-fi technologies appear including the

10
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,560
warp engine that allows travel in the

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,029
galaxy in reasonable times entire

12
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,110
transport that allows us to transfer

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,290
people objects within

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,140
reasonable distances but in any case immediate time

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,430
cybernetic technology of various kinds

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,789
and shapes for sinners or these

17
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,780
tools that can assemble

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,550
molecules atoms to

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,879
practically reconstruct  anything or almost

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,320
feeds objects spare parts and

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,610
anything else

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,059
now it is all

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,649
science fiction technologies but I would focus on the

24
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,470
latter my resistance of this

25
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,790
tool that allows you to produce in

26
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,229
almost zero cost and in time in

27
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,650
almost zero time as well  whatever

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,400
s  overwhelms what is the socio-

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,900
economic model described in star trek we

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,080
deepen too much because online

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,110
you will find rivers of speculations relating to

32
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,799
those that the economic social-political model of the

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,320
universe in star trek but

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,560
this is sufficient for the fact that every

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,580
good is reproducible

36
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,520
at no cost  in zero time it breaks down

37
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,770
the dynamics we

38
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,470
are accustomed to those of the raw

39
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,970
materials of the subdivision of labor of

40
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,620
the supply demand that which

41
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,740
more or less regulates the existence of

42
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,050
all of us to split has made us

43
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,330
know the details  or not but

44
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,240
we all conduct a job we buy

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,750
goods that are somehow built

46
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,950
produced by someone who with resources that

47
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,590
are extracted from p somehow

48
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,670
this plastic bottle there is

49
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,040
petroleum i.e. water i.e.

50
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,930
paper i.e. something like that  all the goods

51
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,300
that have been collected, processed,

52
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,500
assembled, transported,

53
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,980
etc., etc.

54
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,040
clearly precisely n  We have in

55
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,730
this context the scenario of star

56
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,320
trek and it continues to be the

57
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,700
science fiction scenario

58
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,520
and yet today we already have to deal

59
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,680
with goods that are

60
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,060
infinitely reproducible at no cost

61
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,650
practically all cultural assets let's

62
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,910
call them music

63
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,940
literature software pauses in

64
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,840
particular on software

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,060
obviously in this context here there

66
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,370
would be a great parenthesis regarding

67
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,830
copyright has as over time

68
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,010
the earthquake has invented

69
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,330
tools to bring the production

70
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,460
and exchange of reproducible goods back

71
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,120
into the dynamics

72
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,950
of the classical economy those that

73
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,250
precisely based on the scarcity of goods and

74
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,640
on the supply and demand I do not

75
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,170
dwell too much I refer you

76
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,030
to this video that you find

77
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,710
on youtube or to many others that you

78
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,120
find around a single detail I underline

79
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,550
what the software license or rather

80
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,890
the license to  the one better understood to

81
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,170
better say the u and la of the

82
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,280
proprietary software recipe  simply has

83
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,250
an artifice to lead back the

84
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,830
production and exchange of software to

85
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,870
create a false scarcity of this

86
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,600
software so where software is

87
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,820
naturally reproducible at zero cost to

88
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,970
infinity when with a

89
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,130
legal trick it makes sure that you can

90
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,810
use on that software  only with

91
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,640
the license I am going to limit the

92
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,620
availability of that asset, therefore I

93
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,910
refer to all the dynamics

94
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,210
of supply and demand, price, place,

95
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,790
etc., etc. mentioned otherwise they

96
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,770
could not be applied because the

97
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,600
software is reproducible at no cost to

98
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,780
infinity exactly like the

99
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,040
replicators of  star trek allow me

100
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,130
to reproduce any good and makes it

101
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,690
collapse is what the

102
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:43,030
classic production mechanism this fact is

103
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,400
the only factor in which I

104
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,320
dwell on this moment would result

105
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,660
or I repeat it again the software

106
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,460
is reproducible indefinitely at no

107
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,860
cost this for  how

108
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,640
absolute banality can be is not always the case  ì

109
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,550
so clear and explicit and evident to

110
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,990
anyone

111
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,600
so much so that being

112
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,419
all of us who already more or less know

113
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:11,620
what the reality of

114
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,900
free open source software is and even worse those

115
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,460
who do not know it or had

116
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,610
written to speak very distantly

117
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,979
escape this from this

118
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:26,020
essential and evident factor therefore often and

119
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,340
gladly

120
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,590
we find ourselves hearing the question or

121
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,150
even ourselves we ask ourselves this

122
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,390
question of the macro it is possible to create

123
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,850
a sustainable model based on the

124
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,160
software that I give and  then we have to

125
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,370
invent some rather extravagant

126
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,650
alternative models that we are going to tell to

127
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,270
try to convince that bla bla bla

128
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,390
bla bla bla no simply software

129
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,820
is not a physical good and therefore cannot

130
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,500
be traced back to the classic rules of

131
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,670
classical economics those described

132
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,600
by  adam smith or caremark or more bills

133
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,580
you on the other hand will mind given the nature of the

134
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,280
software you need to take

135
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,110
another mo  the different is

136
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,340
the fact of when you hear you ask

137
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,080
but how is it possible that

138
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,420
this thing can exist the question and the answer

139
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,420
should not be but you look there are

140
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,640
models based on assistance on

141
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,100
services on all the other things you already

142
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,640
know the answer should  be

143
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,260
how the hell do you can maintain a model

144
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,790
based on proprietary software then

145
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,160
take on all the burdens of

146
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,070
research development and whatever else take away all the

147
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,910
problems related to piracy because

148
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,720
classic problem of

149
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,130
proprietary software I think it has never been solved

150
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,080
and in the south it has never created  a solution

151
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,760
thanks to [ __ ] the software and producible

152
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,409
indefinitely at no cost

153
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:01,860
and therefore the answer the attitude

154
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,929
towards this of this question

155
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:06,509
should not be but open source is

156
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,289
a possible hypothetical alternative which is

157
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:12,589
probably the only

158
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:15,029
applicable model  to a good of this nature

159
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:20,350
of this fact in this way

160
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,330
we are talking about bottles

161
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,250
we are talking about legino  we are

162
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,960
talking about computers all goods that

163
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,450
need materials, production,

164
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,370
transformation and processing, etc.,

165
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:30,850
etc.,

166
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,710
overcoming something else and therefore

167
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,380
we will necessarily have to think in

168
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,230
some other way more or less this is

169
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,890
what I meant a foolish

170
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,150
banality or stupidity

171
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,700
but that  evidently it is not so often it is

172
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,510
clear to everyone that the origin

173
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,640
of this of my considerations dates

174
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,570
back to 2015 when richard stallman former

175
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,680
president of the foundation

176
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,090
luca torino for the occasion

177
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,039
we, as always, produced his beautiful

178
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,259
two-hour pistolotto on the  free software

179
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:13,629
privacy freedom puts held

180
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,009
in front of linux city etcetera

181
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:18,370
at the end of these two hours a hero from the

182
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,840
public I don't pay for two hours of

183
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,639
pistolotto still trembling to ask

184
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,350
what is the classic question that

185
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,650
out of here but sometimes even here there

186
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,070
excuse me doctor stollman but if I

187
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,340
software a gift of what field and

188
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,130
there the response of the restaurant was stat  a

189
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,309
very vague sounded roughly like in

190
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,750
truth in truth I tell you love your neighbor

191
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,340
as

192
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,550
yourself freedom rights and so on a

193
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,890
very unsatisfactory answer both

194
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,600
for

195
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,430
a person who may not have been so

196
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,310
familiar with the dynamics of the mechanisms

197
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,740
of software  free of open source but I

198
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,709
often show even to those who already know the 10

199
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:05,550
but some details not some

200
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,529
evidences obviously are not yet

201
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,360
well connected then in the face

202
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,060
of this experience

203
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,680
the question of it is not possible that

204
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,089
this is the only one  response from the love

205
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,680
rights

206
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,140
was paid the beach and anything else we have

207
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,770
left but something a little more

208
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,550
precise something more

209
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,339
instrumental

210
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,170


211
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,089


212
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:34,770


213
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,160
banality

214
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,050
the software that can be produced at no

215
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,790
cost and yet it is not so

216
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,160
evidently clear and obvious

217
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,220
we pass it again so I repeat it again the only

218
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,870
m  essay that I wanted to convey today

219
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,910
was this at the moment in which we think

220
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,140
in terms of we reason we

221
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,000
consider

222
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,149
how it is possible to

223
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:06,720
create a sustainable apparatus

224
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,730
that allows self-sustaining and

225
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,860
anything else related to the world of

226
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,240
software always starts  this

227
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,459
assumption the software that can be produced

228
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,459
indefinitely at no cost and this is the

229
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,819
detail that differentiates the

230
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:23,009
bottles of water, the potatoes, the mails and

231
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:26,209
the chairs from the software and this is the only

232
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,519
message that I send you, as

233
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,709
always, I was very quick  because

234
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,980
if necessary I would like to have some

235
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,790
considerations some ideas from you

236
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,089
therefore tell me if you more or less

237
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:45,449
find yourself in this and this in this

238
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:46,920
line or you say no he said a

239
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,969
[ __ ] and there is

240
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:03,050
yes there is a very low cost of the

241
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,710
match  let's put it this way

242
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,660
then we would have to apologize and

243
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:20,080
contested the fact that the prompt no not

244
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,840
at no cost as the supports or in

245
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,030
any case the activity the time it

246
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,670
takes to do  rlo it is not because it approached

247
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,680
extremely low I agree with you

248
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,750
no it is not at no cost

249
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,510
certainly already clear certain exactly

250
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,740
how it was replicator of star trek and it

251
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,510
requires energy obviously certain

252
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,140
of extremely low cost almost zero

253
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,410
this I hang up not to miss us

254
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,720
it would then be the whole cloud game

255
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,090
in which I don't buy the software I

256
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,580
don't buy the service for which I buy

257
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,460
disk space bandwidth computation didn't buy the

258
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,310
software but I buy something else

259
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,440
finite resources and therefore attributable to the

260
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,740
dynamics of the classical economy of

261
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,390
limited resources  and scarce and therefore with

262
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,650
a price such as a cost etcetera

263
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,610
etcetera

264
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,370
even there it could be talked about for a long time

265
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,930
also because it seems to me quite

266
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,470
evident that the action is both

267
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,900
willy-nilly also says service and

268
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,200
service that is he promised the fact that

269
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,560
I can want it

270
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,700
like this  they have made sure that I

271
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,230
purchase the service when I want to get

272
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,280
rid of or rather

273
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,140
vice versa the service may want to

274
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,800
buy for  because or because he is

275
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,240
the only one supplier and that is so I

276
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,680
can contact him alone to do certain things

277
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,140
or vice versa maybe there would be

278
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,230
the possibility of doing it myself

279
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,300
badly google suite I can buy it

280
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,470
wherever there is no

281
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,700
escape  ex cloud I can either take on the burden

282
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,470
of the disk space bandwidth server

283
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,090
between maintenance in the city etc. or

284
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,820
pay someone else to do it for

285
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,920
me and then pay for this work that

286
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,950
is done and the resources necessary to

287
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,290
run this this application however

288
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,410
precisely c  'is service service 1

289
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,330
when I choose it I have chosen it and

290
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,360
from there it is difficult to get out the other one I can

291
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,160
turn to different suppliers who

292
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,600
offer me approximately the same type of

293
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,520
service and when

294
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,740
I have enough time to take care of it  I have

295
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,930
enough resources to do well I

296
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,660
cost too much to climb so I decide to

297
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,070
cost less they

298
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,830
pull at home I can do it there too there is a

299
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,920
way and way to react with this kind

300
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,190
of services that has had two c

301
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,140
ose apart in the cloud which I find very

302
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,840
risky precisely because we no longer have

303
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,820
the software in hand and somehow

304
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,380
gave the answer but I think it

305
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,660
always comes out veiled

306
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,810
I have always told the four guns

307
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,810
who listen to me that the model cannot

308
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,580
be much  different from that of the

309
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,040
legal world of the lawyers of the doctors of the

310
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,810
accountants all the information is

311
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,730
available to all as

312
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,040
information can be copied at no cost but

313
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,200
the services are paid and private clinics

314
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,530
cost a lot because services with

315
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,900
serious professionals and even some

316
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,260
physical things of  side dish that you eat better,

317
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,680
however, it is and yet the world continues to

318
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,110
think that if the

319
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,550
proprietary software model is our exception,

320
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,560
the thing that I struggle to

321
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,190
pass this is that the strange thing

322
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,680
is that and contrary to reality,

323
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,590
the latter is proprietary  and you have

324
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,480
nominated yourself as president for the fsf

325
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,100
now that the place cheered by songs

326
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,310
absolutely no where it will

327
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,570
immediately live up to  also by

328
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,150
mistake and I trust and hope that they can

329
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,810
choose a character that is minimally more

330
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,360
even physically more acceptable

331
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,800
than what was there before

332
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,660
how long it is still time I still do

333
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,860
a consideration since here we are

334
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,570
so we are attacking or if someone

335
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,350
else wants what to tell me  only to the

336
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,730
last consideration of d

337
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,850
alessandro

338
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,070
and what I was talking about yesterday also goes

339
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,300
out yes it

340
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,730
is important to reason also

341
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,910
in the perspective of it

342
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,120
is a sector in which

343
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,770
software necessarily grows the

344
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,420
meeting the world

345
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,580
there are more and more requests for

346
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,760
skills of  ability of will of

347
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,730
good will to do things and build

348
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,800
things

349
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,610
too often fortunately on

350
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,350
enough contact with the

351
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,300
university environment of my city turin

352
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,410
but too often I see the guys who

353
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,700
once graduated

354
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,150
even before or shortly after

355
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,890
they take expatriate for  go to

356
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,770
work for google for facebook or

357
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,540
simply go to e  steroid to

358
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,800
do something else

359
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,680
here they are I would like instead a

360
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,640
local awareness to try to fight

361
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,310
these skills towards not so much the

362
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,500
giants who being the juve who offer

363
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,450
a little active canteen there is also an

364
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,600
excellent remuneration but try to

365
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,430
grow what is

366
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,230
the reality the local reality is not rightly for

367
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:32,000
a question of patriotism to the

368
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,279
genre simply because in this

369
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,410
way these resources these

370
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,410
skills are more easily

371
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,200
applied hopefully to then grow

372
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,010
what is the tool or take the

373
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,260
free tool the free platform

374
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,550
l  'he said da forma loses it therefore

375
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,140
in some way it is

376
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,950
a virtuous circle so that

377
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,830
when the more skills

378
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,390
enrich this environment, the more

379
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,370
the environment grows for the benefit of all of

380
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,060
us and therefore

381
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,060
the fact of tightening  the relationships between

382
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,819
what is the community of geeks

383
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,040
that the one who likes to fiddle so much

384
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,170
doing things to play as much as  o and those who, on the

385
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,720
other hand, need these skills

386
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,690
for the professional sphere in the

387
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,400
workplace in order to allow even

388
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,530
those who tweak to continue

389
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,750
tweaking for work and this would be very

390
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,840
nice and very practical for all

391
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,970
other considerations, then demand training more than

392
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,160
a question

393
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,590
I had the pleasure of meeting

394
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,250
melani reback this summer at the web

395
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,580
marketing festival and she found

396
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,040
this combination for open source

397
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,770
specifically she opened radicals

398
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,309
open society

399
00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:00,649
one defines her as the first non-profit security

400
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:03,679
console on tanzi company so she is

401
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,710
a '  a non-profit cyber

402
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,570
security company is one of the ten most

403
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,970
influential women in Europe in terms of networks and

404
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,340
security skills and has found this

405
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,499
combination in which they develop

406
00:18:15,499 --> 00:18:18,019
purely open source software,

407
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:20,480
liberalize them and then have a

408
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,970
service company obviously to which  among other things,

409
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,919
all the turnover to 80 percent of the

410
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:29,919
company's turnover, let's say

411
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,260
srl to understand it will not be  nno srl because I

412
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,470
stop a drama ok he donates it to the

413
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,260
foundation this virtuous circle among

414
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,270
other things is interesting in terms of

415
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,169
taxation so he strongly believes in this

416
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:47,289
thing and has found this thing that is

417
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:49,630
absolutely obviously legal also gives

418
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,980
visibility to the company because

419
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,960
clearly the  company to a several

420
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,340
million to the company for which they write and

421
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,650
finance open source

422
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,590
partly they do it alone but they do

423
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,250
services through a company for which it is

424
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,250
an example is virtuous is a model a

425
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,789
model of tax also

426
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:15,159
absolutely yes and indeed I remember that from

427
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,350
a  couple of years in the East and promotes

428
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,210
this appeal

429
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,830
we call it 1 percent or

430
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,590
we invite all those who work with

431
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,440
free open source software to allocate

432
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,000
at least one percent of their

433
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,070
turnover to more support of the

434
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,130
projects they work with and therefore we know  all

435
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,260
that around is full of people who do the

436
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,340
ctv or three magento sites the city of free

437
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,380
of another way and the application with

438
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,430
django with reakt c  on etcetera etcetera

439
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,210
there is therefore a linux web server or better

440
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,310
with a linux server an apache web server

441
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,310
with a database maria di bo poster and

442
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,180
etcetera city city all projects that

443
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,130
knows who is somehow it is good to

444
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,140
support then coming back

445
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,270
the invitation if you work in this area or

446
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,020
as books for the city is easy because

447
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,940
you convince yourself yourself or

448
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,220
in some company that does this kind of

449
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,770
job, turn to

450
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,590
those who are competent to allocate the one

451
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,330
percent which is very little end of the day

452
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,420
bills of turnover and

453
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,420
projects that allow you to do de

454
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,100
facto work and therefore pay

455
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,830
bills

456
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,429
these are still figures

457
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,620
until recently you in the last year and

458
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,179
the various matches there you go they looked

459
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:38,740
at us limits to 30 thousand euros l  '' a precise one is

460
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,830
only 300 euros a year and we are still

461
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,100
talking about millions of euros of dollars and

462
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,080
anything else, but also in this sense

463
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,909
each one can contribute not so much

464
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:54,279
for a philanthropic spirit but to

465
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,230
support co  to develop the tools with

466
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,750
which each of us then pays the rent

467
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,809
the bills so not so much because it

468
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:03,519
is beautiful and because it is right but because it is

469
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,419
convenient

470
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,000
for money that prefer pockets

471
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,750
to us if every now and then a euro to those who

472
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,190
allow us to put money in our pocket a

473
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,020
lot  better

474
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:21,830
other considerations or thanks to all

475
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:29,220
[Applause]
