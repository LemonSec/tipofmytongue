1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
hello everyone my name is maybe

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,220
emilians in the dojo i'm eco i'm here to

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,230
introduce you zanchin tech probably

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,780
many of you already know jean jacques

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,509
because i myself met her at desk

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,310
five years ago and since then i've followed a

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,310
path to become a master of this

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,550
new  discipline recognized as a new

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,310
martial art

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,539
the explanation of the discipline is

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,650
contained in the name itself jean shin tech

12
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,320
because the discipline unites the

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,960
traditional martial arts therefore jean shin

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,020
the condition of the master from the

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,520
martial arts master of the stillness of

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,230
knowledge and awareness of the

17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,940
here and now and  of

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,200
tech technology was born just five years

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,520
ago in genoa today genoa has three schools

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,270
of jean shin tech pavia and then

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,739
gradually spread mainly in northern italy

22
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,489
with milan rome verona shower from which I

23
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,460
come and from this year also modena

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,740
but yes  the numerous new sensors are formed

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,500
for which it will surely expand at

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,570
a capillary level a bit for the north of

27
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,460
Italy  to

28
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,100
me precisely I come from the doge of

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,560
verona for which jean shin tech for now

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,700
we are 2 sensei enabled eco and robbie but

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,900
we are

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,450
not fooled by the height

33
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,090
of the current 66 but we are growing

34
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,580
so we have two new

35
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,490
girls who are enabled for

36
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,980
the  'teaching of the discipline and therefore

37
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,170
we will again expand the dojo

38
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,250
also in Verona

39
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,960
but what do we do if the traditional martial art

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,640
deals with

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,900
physical conflict the art lozano sheen tech

42
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,290
deals with digital conflict talking about

43
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,220
digital it is impossible not to talk about

44
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,508
internet for which children and adults are asked

45
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:11,510
what internet is and

46
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,580
are invited to think about how it was

47
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,680
formed on what it is and its

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,150
evolution and therefore to understand that

49
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,970
obviously it is a connection network

50
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,600
where everyone is  connected to the other therefore

51
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,820
both socially and through any

52
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,570
type of device and very often we

53
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,020
end up in the news for devices that

54
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,260
those who talk to and the average user do not

55
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,570
make themselves c  onto what is happening is

56
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,410
a constantly evolving discipline

57
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,069
that is based on the study

58
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,129
of cyber attacks and therefore of

59
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,590
digital attacks and

60
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,370
therefore the fact of being able to get out of them

61
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,969
to do what

62
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:03,499
to gain awareness on the fact

63
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:07,159
that if the digital footprint in the world

64
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,980
physical is now a well-known and well-known thing

65
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,480
we must realize that we have a

66
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,799
digital footprint of

67
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,689
course that we begin to

68
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:21,349
train ourselves in the digital world and kids who

69
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:25,489
have as a gift already at 10 years 11

70
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,639
years before any type of device

71
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,919
do not realize  who themselves begin

72
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,250
to decide

73
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,889
their imprint their digital imprint and if the films of

74
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,159
our times have introduced this

75
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,040
path for which the world to which they have

76
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,079
made nio that already introduced the fact

77
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,989
that one entered a world but if one

78
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,659
died in the world  digital was equivalent to

79
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:56,540
dying in the world in the physical world

80
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,459
we come from a previous tradition in

81
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:00,010
which

82
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,040
futuristic films talked about but  cchine

83
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,659
able to speak able to reach

84
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:09,290
anyone but then the generation

85
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,019
was not ready and said do not believe

86
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,640
everything that is shown to you all

87
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,200
these things do not exist they do not

88
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,620
belong to your world and

89
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,600


90
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,789
a sort of  complete separation gap

91
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:25,250
between what they were

92
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,949
told and what they lived

93
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:29,330
for this reason one of the emissions

94
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,539
of sunshine tech is to abolish

95
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,610
making sure that words are used

96
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,080
with awareness

97
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,900
why that phone that device

98
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,060
that connects  a network does not

99
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,759
connect to a virtual world as the virtual is

100
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,099
often mistakenly said to

101
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:47,330
something that does not exist

102
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,599
so we immediately abolish this

103
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:53,660
word in starting to differentiate the

104
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,690
physical world from the

105
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,860
digital world and make it clear that if

106
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,229
an aggression occurs  the physical world and

107
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,940
the physical world that must be addressed

108
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,380
if the aggression occurs in the

109
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,659
digital world is in the digital world  that must

110
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:10,400
be addressed this does not mean

111
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,020
demonizing the technology on the

112
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,560
contrary it is a technological awareness

113
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,320
in order to know what the tool

114
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,750
is using so we do not

115
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,880
demonize technology but rather promote it with

116
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,550
awareness and this is the comparison

117
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,449
that those adults make

118
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,909
if there were adults  in the dojo is

119
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:32,240
that of a telephone where maybe

120
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,479
we met at the time of our

121
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:37,980
grandparents all day

122
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,470
and the confrontation was after we went

123
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,970
home and we had the desire to

124
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,940
communicate again and we created alarmism

125
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,470
for our grandparents who  they said but what

126
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,820
are you doing have you seen yourself all

127
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,130
day you still need to communicate

128
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,140
yes because man is a social animal he

129
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,090
needs to communicate and the more devices

130
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,400
we give them to do it the more he will use them and

131
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,430
be happy and the boys live in

132
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,380
this world in  a world interconnected

133
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,670
with difficulty both in the physical world it

134
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,350
was the digital world and very often

135
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,450
passes the news because we come to

136
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,580
talk  of cyber bullying that on the one

137
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,740
hand bullying there was since our

138
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,040
times those who did not have the bully of the situation at school or in the

139
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,650
village where he lived in the house

140
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,890
but today there is

141
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,630
cyberbullying

142
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,430
here is what science tech has done to

143
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,250
everyone  he has cataloged these types of aggressions and

144
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,700
has given them a name because as

145
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,400
happens in traditional martial arts

146
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,610
if I see an attack coming I recognize

147
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,250
the attack coming out of that attack

148
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,890
because for every attack there is a

149
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,020
defense so what jean

150
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,570
shin tech did is to have  cataloged the main

151
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,750
digital attacks giving it a name and

152
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,600
this already takes away the fear because it is no

153
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,520
longer something that I do not know is something

154
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,710
that I can associate and if I

155
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,770
associate it I can have a

156
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,230
possible defense for which in this case

157
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,930
cyberbullying for  us is this signal

158
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,880
the attacks are on those red signals

159
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,600
for us it is a crs attack where crs stands

160
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,240
for continued repeated and systematic and

161
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,090
because it continued because it occurs several

162
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,150
times a  The systematic day because you can be

163
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,950
sure that sooner or later a

164
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,110
new systematic attack will arrive because it

165
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,170
hits exactly where it knows

166
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,890
it hurts the most but unlike

167
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,400
traditional bullying which is physical and takes place in

168
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,800
the physical world and involves direct contact

169
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,090
with that person

170
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,500
the digital continues over time

171
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,220
but this does not hurt what

172
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,229
we teach children to recognize it and to

173
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,020
use defense

174
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,030
techniques defense techniques that are green

175
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,520
with techniques to use that

176
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,690
we teach them and we study them to understand

177
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,900
that it is always possible to stop  an

178
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,500
assault

179
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,680
obviously if it is a

180
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,020
systematic continuous repeated crs attack will be

181
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,690
much more difficult than a fake

182
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,060
friend request that can be

183
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,729
blocked much more easily but it is

184
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:21,770
always possible to stop a

185
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,759
digital version to ensure that

186
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,819
the wrong word victim is no longer used  very often

187
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:31,400
we hear on television or in the

188
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,529
news that girl is a victim of

189
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,779
cyber b  bullying in school more and more

190
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:38,599
victims of cyberbullying no the word

191
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,849
victim does not exist for us because the

192
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,529
word victim we are used to reading

193
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:45,320
in history books where victims are counted

194
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,779
but the victim is a person

195
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:48,980
who has given up and a person who has died

196
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,680
a person who died for us are

197
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,100
targets and as long as you are a target you

198
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,130
always have the possibility of getting out of that

199
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,610
type of aggression and therefore that's

200
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,110
why jean shin takes over that's why

201
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,959
martial arts take over we educate a

202
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,339
bit like martial arts to the

203
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,620
repetition of techniques to

204
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,779
repetitions  of gestures to ensure that

205
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:14,600
everything happens the defense takes place in

206
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,050
an instinctive unconditional way

207
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,839
we should not think about it but it is a modus

208
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,959
operandi and for this we take a cue

209
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:27,320
from martial arts masters as the

210
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,560
founder of aikido or it is

211
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,680
like the foundation of karate  the

212
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,440
founder of karate or the

213
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,329
founder of judo

214
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,130
here are these founding masters of

215
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,600
the martial arts disciplines  the

216
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,920
traditional ones

217
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,990
we report as examples and guys when we

218
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,550
project these slides in the dojo the

219
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,350
guys say that we understand everything

220
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,730
you have to be old with a beard to

221
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,390
be a martial arts master is not to

222
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,150
be aware of what you

223
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,680
are doing and as an example we bring the

224
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,060
demonstration that  the founder

225
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,610
of judo called in france to

226
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,160
demonstrate the discipline by challenging

227
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,050
the world champion a handsome young man

228
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,650
who as you can see in the attack was

229
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,890
completely rendered harmless but

230
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,240
what we point out that this

231
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,070
discipline is not aggressive is not

232
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,890
a hatred of violence  we point out how

233
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,800
in the face of the master there is peace

234
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,250
and tranquility, awareness because

235
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,830
he saw the attack coming he

236
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,260
recognized that attack maybe he

237
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,390
even gave them a name but above all,

238
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,360
having recognized it, he knows how to get out of

239
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,930
that type of aggression and  opponent

240
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,120
once it is stationary we point out

241
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,550
that it is not a photomontage but here you

242
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,260
have  I love the twist of the foot that

243
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,690
highlights that the person is trying

244
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,280
to free himself from the from the Venetian from the

245
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,790
master and the face of the master there is no

246
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,670
hatred there is no malice but there is only the

247
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,850
desire to get out of that aggression and

248
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,250
then  to enhance even more the last

249
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,370
image to make the zhang xin understand

250
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,170
the last representative image of

251
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,690
this calm this quiet and this

252
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,230
tranquility in living an aggression

253
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,130
with the tsar sheen that is awareness of the

254
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,320
here and now and therefore it is not a

255
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,790
combat system  the scientific is

256
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,210
dancing tech area but it is a path it is a

257
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,680
path that unfolds over time

258
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,670
our goal is

259
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,980
not to how technology evolves

260
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,640
so that we ourselves evolve the

261
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,920
meetings are weekly and

262
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,890
last about a '  an hour and a half with a

263
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,290
maximum number of 15 people divided by

264
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,370
age groups

265
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,250
the group of children from 11 to 18 years and

266
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,100
then from 18 years on any doge

267
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,150
of Italy to the two routes to the

268
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,880
children route then those  who are

269
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,710
forming their fingerprint and

270
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,050
adults who may have already formed

271
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,420
their fingerprint those who practice

272
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,030
science in the who is defined as

273
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,610
a digital warrior and therefore his

274
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,820
level is expressed according to the

275
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,800
bracelets we have borrowed a little from

276
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,150
traditional martial arts for which  not

277
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,530
being able to have belts because most

278
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,740
of the time we are behind a desk and

279
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,080
therefore it would not show we use the

280
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,570
bracelet from traditional martial arts

281
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,740


282
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,270
we must have a white which is an

283
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,180
initial starting level and a black

284
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,610
which is the final level but all the

285
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,540
other levels do not  are random this

286
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,290
case these bracelets are taken from the

287
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,300
connection cable with the

288
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,820
network so with the ethernet cable and therefore the

289
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,980
subdivision of the colors is that of

290
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,640
the ethernet cable and traditional what you do

291
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,010
in the dojo you start and end with a

292
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,010
greeting of traditional martial arts

293
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,410
because the symbol of respect and

294
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,080
entry into a new environment

295
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,570
is part of all  I extend the dojo the dojo is

296
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,180
an empty room that is set up

297
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,190
computers are assembled very often

298
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,370
the kids do not know

299
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,339
we do find

300
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,920
raspberry computers or computers to

301
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,220
assemble is a bit equivalent to

302
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,570
traditional martial arts when you wear

303
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,510
the kimono that is yes  takes off you leave the

304
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,630
clothes you used up to a few

305
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,200
minutes before and entering the dojo you

306
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,050
prepare yourself for a new way a new

307
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,339
path for which

308
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,589
we set up the dojo we assemble the stations and then we repeat

309
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:56,050
the 5 every time the five

310
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,940
fundamental rules that are the ones you see

311
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,430
here in the banner first rule do not

312
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,850
attack in the dojo we obviously teach

313
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,640
techniques they are used both in defense but

314
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,770
potentially they can also be used to

315
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,750
attack and our goal is not to

316
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,060
create cyber

317
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,589
criminals our goal is to make them able

318
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:16,620
to defend themselves from cyber attacks

319
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,050
so first rule  it is not to attack

320
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,510
everything you will learn in the dosio it

321
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,160
should never serve you as a led  ere no

322
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,520
other respect than for oneself

323
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,160
respect for the teacher because he is

324
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,620
teaching respect for the group and what is

325
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,930
more difficult than even for those who

326
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,420
are attacking you very often the bully is

327
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,690
a person who has perhaps more problems

328
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,860
than you are experiencing in that

329
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,640
moment for which the aggressor

330
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,400
needs your respect you have to show him the way

331
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,959
the way out

332
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:52,529
you have to give him the opportunity to honorably come out of the

333
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,050


334
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,070
conscious aggression that he has found a

335
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,870
person capable of overcoming his attacks

336
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,490
what is said in the dojo remains  in the dojo

337
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,950
this serves to ensure that the boys

338
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,680
feel free to

339
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,330
perhaps tell an attack in which they are

340
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,430
living in an environment that is able

341
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,700
to understand it and not judge it and help it

342
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,220
in defense because from the white

343
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,450
orange bracelet onwards

344
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,950
we teach the boys not  only to

345
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,900
defend ourselves that we did it

346
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,360
in the previous path but to

347
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,630
defend others to recognize aggression in others

348
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,990
at least d  two teachers and three

349
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,550
students this obviously has

350
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,620
more meanings than the fact of not

351
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,230
being alone with a minor but our

352
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,120
idea is to create a group for

353
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,279
which we say that the minimum of one group

354
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,100
to be able to work together is three students

355
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,100
and two teachers and  you leave the dojo

356
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,050
as you found it if you have assembled the

357
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,779
stations we answer you this teaches

358
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,720
a sort of respect for the environment in

359
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,720
which you are elections can be of

360
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,250
treatment purely

361
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,709
technical elections I give you an example arrives

362
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,269
at the friend request to one  of

363
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:07,850
them or anyone on any social

364
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,190
network here for us that is a signal

365
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,829
a signal of false identity

366
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:15,230
if it is really sure that the person

367
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,079
who is contacting you knows them or that they

368
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,120
are really who they say they are for which

369
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,339
this is a signal of false identity

370
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:23,570
we teach them techniques for

371
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,250
example to trace a photograph or

372
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,930
to trace a phone number to

373
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,950
understand if who they say they are really is

374
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:35,300
therefore co  nknowledge and doubt then

375
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,760
identify any attacks and

376
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,140
any counter moves

377
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,170
if I have a friend request and they

378
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,329
have been accustomed to metal

379
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:47,360
immediately as a reflection to understand

380
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,240
that it is a false identity I can

381
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,430
trace the photo or trace the

382
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,390
phone number and then I

383
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,500
recognized the  'attack

384
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,649
I used a counter move and I can

385
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:03,680
simply get out of it for example we

386
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,750
call it zeroing that is it means

387
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,429
completely blocking the conversations

388
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,079
case analysis we have studied

389
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,829
hundreds of cases in Italy now

390
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,779
but in America in cases of cyber bullying they

391
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,069
were born much earlier than us so

392
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,500
we have studied hundreds of cases

393
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,720
we have cataloged all types of

394
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,940
attacks because basically the

395
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,630
digital attack pattern is the

396
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,659
same so this allows us, once

397
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:39,039
recognized, to stop it as soon as

398
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,059
possible.

399
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,799


400
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,960


401
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,600
big of us and is

402
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,130
undergoing an a  digital heel this is the

403
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,200
sweet of Verona if I still have three

404
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:03,279
minutes or not if I still have three minutes I show you

405
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,440
a video of the state of the art of jean

406
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,419
shin tech is still published on

407
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,779
youtube and of 2018 where we

408
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:13,630
show you some guys from the dojo who  they do

409
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,230
osint open source intelligence just

410
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,539
to put these into practice

411
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:21,549
these these the defense of these

412
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:23,850
attacks

413
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,020
sorry that

414
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,679
's right he made

415
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,149
the audio

416
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,500
[Music]

417
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,510
no this is not the audio but

418
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:56,200
basically okay it says the

419
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,909
music is somehow  more

420
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,179
captivating more engaging the boys

421
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:03,190
of different bracelets are divided into

422
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:11,649
groups an audio file of a

423
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,600
possible aggression is given and the boys are asked

424
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,730
in the shortest possible time of

425
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,169
types to identify and

426
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,559
identify whose that voice is and the

427
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:26,080
telephone number to which  it is associated who it is for

428
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,789
whom you see this is the timer what you

429
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:31,570
are using is mal the go to keep

430
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,340
track of what they are doing

431
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,490
and you will see as time goes on

432
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,019
inform them  mations that have therefore are a

433
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:40,779
voice sample and the

434
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,909
phone number the phone number is not of a

435
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:44,649
private person but the guys obviously do not

436
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:47,289
know it and therefore what you see is in

437
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:50,159
real time they will try to understand

438
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:53,230
the identity of the person by keeping track

439
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,610
of that  that they are doing

440
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:16,739
ok they found their name and surname and therefore

441
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:19,899
completely the registry of the person

442
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:22,468
who is attacking them

443
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,820
the subject did not know he had an identity card

444
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,380


445
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,789
the boys found it and

446
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,300
in less than ten minutes

447
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,420
here I thank you for the whole day

448
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,540
Roberta and I will be here if you have

449
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,220
any questions or doubts or concerns,

450
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,190
we must turn our t-shirt even if

451
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,750
we sweat we will try not to remove it to

452
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,830
be identifiable

453
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,180
good day to everyone and thanks

454
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:47,390
[Applause]
