1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,090
so welcome ss proxy is a tool and

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,980
at the same time it tells a bit

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,950
what is the story of an activity I

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,820
carried out during my work because

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,250
unlike alessandro and if

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,810
you search my name on google you will find

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,269
only bad things then me  I introduce myself

8
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,869
very briefly my name is lorenzo as I

9
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:30,900
am a security consultant I work in mind

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,170
security and let's say what we do is

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,280
basically break web applications

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,640
and break devices help do some hackers

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,559


14
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,890
obviously in a positive sense because then

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,059
we report the vulnerabilities the producers

16
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,180
and so on are also a  lover of

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,860
python and automation

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,949
everything that is boring to do I

19
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,350
try to harlow script or to

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,140
make it automatic and this is one of

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,899
those cases in short this talk is born a

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,770
bit from this need

23
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,970
basically here this is a bit like

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,220
the  I think I always start with the idea of

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,299
starting to say I do a good project but

26
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,759
then it always ends up in collagen stack

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,780
overflow in short, it is a  a bit of a story,

28
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,190
however, because I am here first of

29
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,280
all to talk to you about how to

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,960
intercept the http traffic that is

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,640
generated by what can be a

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,910
device on which we cannot

33
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,850
explicitly configure a proxy you

34
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,950
know that on devices such as our

35
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,080
phones they are quite intelligent

36
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,360
so if I tell him you see that this is the

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,430
proxy from which you have to pass

38
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,250
your traffic there he says ok he passes all

39
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,020
the traffic from there and if I am an

40
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,480
attacker and I can intercept him

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,910
I read everything you do send

42
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,730
etc. with the  your phone this is

43
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,270
a technique to do a little to realize

44
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,920
this interception will be able to

45
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,020
get in the way between device is

46
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,300
what is internet or what is lost with

47
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,730
which the device wants to communicate

48
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,620
without precisely that this device has a

49
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,800
setting to do this all then

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,480
it is developed with the tool I wrote

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,060
that automates the various steps of this

52
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,980
technique

53
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,660
so basically the problem is

54
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,920
this

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,220
an activity arrives in the office and tells me

56
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,850
ok this is a device you have to do a penta

57
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,890
on this device it communicates in http

58
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,989
very well then I look at it I turn it on

59
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:40,640
and say ok but where is the proxy to

60
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,110
intercept

61
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,690
eh no there is no how not c  'it is and this is

62
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,510
my face it is a problem because we

63
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,230
are blind

64
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,020
we do not know that device with what it

65
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,570
communicates and how it communicates is a problem and

66
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,090
we must solve it I anticipate that

67
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,519
there is no definitive solution that is

68
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,860
there is no solution  for each case,

69
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,500
however, there is a technique

70
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,350
called invisible pro xing which

71
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,190
allows us to succeed under

72
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,050
certain circumstances in certain cases

73
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,120
to intercept the traffic of a

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,590
device

75
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,970
the technique is well described by an

76
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,330
article that was created by post

77
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,690
swiger are  the authors of the toolbar

78
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,440
how many have already heard of

79
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,470
barp ok for those who have never heard of it

80
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,020
imagine a software a proxy

81
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,810
to which we can direct the

82
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,510
http traffic of a device  ivo of

83
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,520
our browser of anything you talk about

84
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,100
in http and this allows us to

85
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,860
analyze it to see it lieder to see

86
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,140
it rl to intercept it so to

87
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,330
stop it before it goes to the final server

88
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,700
to modify it and a whole series of

89
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,370
operations that of operations that in the

90
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,830
field of  caen testing web fantastic

91
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,140
application are on the agenda

92
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,799
so we have this technique how we

93
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,790
implement it how we develop it

94
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,400
first of all we need a setup we need

95
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,590
a mini laboratory as I told you before

96
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,840
we have a device and then we have a

97
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,358
computer the attacker's computer from

98
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,089
which we create a hotspot in this case

99
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,760
let's say for example a wifi hotspot

100
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,070
suppose that our device is

101
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,970
that I know a tablet or a phone ok that

102
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,729
has a wifi device wifi connectivity

103
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:35,910
for which we create a hotspot we hook

104
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,040
our device this hotspot in

105
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,740
this way the  our computer becomes

106
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,490
the gateway for that device

107
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,770
also becomes the dns provider

108
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,640
so all the traffi  co of the device

109
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,110
will inevitably pass from our pc

110
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,250
so step number one after which on the

111
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,229
same pc we install boats to

112
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:00,120
our next now what

113
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,910
we can not do is to tell the device

114
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,950
to go directly to talk with

115
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,520
beard what we want to do

116
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,740
we want the device to talk to

117
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,510
bar

118
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,920
with burt we can analyze the

119
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,240
traffic and then we send

120
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,370
it back to the internet correctly

121
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,190
returns the answer from the internet

122
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,750
we send it back to our

123
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,370
device everything comes back

124
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,120
we have the traffic we are happy now if

125
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,650
a device as I said

126
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,330
before does not have this

127
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,480
proxy setting we do not  we can send it to

128
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,240
beard directly but what can we

129
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,230
do then first of all as I told you

130
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,110
all the traffic of the device passes from

131
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,130
my pc including its dns requests the

132
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,060
dns basically what it allows us to

133
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,540
do allows us to know which domain

134
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,060
the device is contacting i.e. which is

135
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,980
the enpa in the final which ours with which

136
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,600
with which our device wants

137
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,480
to talk and we

138
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,490
can see this thing we can intercept the

139
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,950
dns requests are in clear obviously

140
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,560
so we know exactly when

141
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,900
we run an application on a device

142
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,610
that can be for example android is a

143
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,410
tablet

144
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,030
etc.  domain is going to

145
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,500
contact this is the first point to

146
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,170
understand who our device wants to talk to

147
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:21,850


148
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,310
second point to be able to redirect

149
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,050
its traffic

150
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,430
we must make sure to create a

151
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,710
sort of virtual interface on our

152
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,320
computer in which we are going to map

153
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,790
what the domain is  that our

154
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,820
device wants to go and contact at the

155
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,740
end of all this round we must

156
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,060
also create what is a proxy

157
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,030
lissner inside a bar with

158
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,530
a tool inside our

159
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,620
software to intercept that says I

160
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,360
replace myself I listen to the

161
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,400
'current management interface and I

162
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,470
wait for the device to contact me in

163
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,320
such a way as to steal the traffic from it

164
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,680
quite elaborate and complex let's

165
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,330
go down a little bit in the

166
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,740
technical detail of how

167
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,260
these things are done the various steps then

168
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,890
number one intercept what are

169
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,100
the dns requests the classic tour in

170
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,280
very simple dump types a very

171
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,020
quiet command line

172
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,960
for which I specify the wlan 0  which is

173
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,819
the interface on which I created the

174
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,879
commercial then I tell it as a filter you see that

175
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,599
you have to keep only blue dp and the

176
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,370
requests that go on port 53

177
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,259
because it is the one with which the dns

178
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,289
usually speaks and more to filter

179
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:38,699
even better the  I give what is

180
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,409
the IP address of my

181
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:44,550
device which in this case is 10 42 02 28

182
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,050
and specifically I did a test

183
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,520
all those you see are the domains

184
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,099
that have been contacted by the device

185
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,470
there are many things from google because  it was

186
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,270
a device in question is an

187
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,940
android phone among which there is let's say the

188
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,130
target our domain of interest

189
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,110
for which we would like to intercept the

190
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,650


191
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,500
traffic I put it in fat  tto and the corriere.it

192
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,530
so our purpose of the attackers queue

193
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,360
as a tester is to intercept the

194
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,699
traffic that starts from the device and goes

195
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,729
to the corriere.it step number one of

196
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:19,770
our we know that the device calls the

197
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,370
courier very well step number 2 create

198
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,080
a  virtual interface

199
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,599
even here a simple command with if

200
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,969
config I can create a

201
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:33,390
virtual interface on a very simple physical

202
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,000
and assigns it an arbitrary ip address

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,549
100 100 101 very simple the conflict

204
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,779
among other things has been deprecated

205
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,079
lately but you can use the

206
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:52,380
same pip  what is easy the same third step

207
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,370
I have to know however that who is corriere.it

208
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,140
what is his ip address before

209
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,120
going to change the areas direct it

210
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,160
so I do a look up of that

211
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,180
domain

212
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,310
and I discover that corriere.it has a

213
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,550
public ip address  and 151 101 etc.

214
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,220
this I then need to get back to

215
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,959
look at the request in the

216
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,050
correct way and then expect an answer at

217
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,810
this point I modify my ethics file

218
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,149
os that p  For those who do not know the file

219
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:23,279
that deals with resolving names

220
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,920
assigns

221
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,899
an address to a domain name and here said in

222
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,930
simple terms and therefore here in my

223
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,370
specific case I assign

224
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,990
the ip address 100 100 101 to the domain

225
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,310
www.corriere  .it

226
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,220
at this point what happens before

227
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,930
talking about how to configure barp

228
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,720
we stay here and what happens when

229
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,640
the device when the device asks

230
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,120
again which ip address to corriere.it

231
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,070
my computer from which all the traffic passes will

232
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,560
reply bell ip address and

233
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,790
100 100 101

234
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,550
we are ready to configure our bar

235
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,820
so we add a new lissner

236
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,360
we reach it on port at 443

237
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,370
this is because I expect

238
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,680
the connection to be in https then

239
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,200
encrypted and therefore typically

240
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,960
ends up on that port and then I tell it

241
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,300
rightly so that the ip address on which it

242
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,580
must listen and the 100 100

243
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,350
101 below at the bottom right you will

244
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,720
also find the re direct therefore the real ip address

245
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,060
which barp must forward  the

246
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,550
communication

247
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,529
at this point we made it

248
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:42,620
that is our device makes requests

249
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,050
and through the bar I can intercept them

250
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,089
great victory

251
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,360
ok but what is the problem that this

252
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,779
thing does not scale that is in the sense I

253
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,959
have shown you many hand-made steps

254
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,550
goes  good to do them by hand when we have a

255
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,450
domain

256
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,450
two domains but when we have 40 that

257
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,630
is a bit long it is a bit boring and hence

258
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,560
the idea of automating automated with

259
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,709
a simple tool written in python

260
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:19,390
python and beige is a few things like this

261
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,120
and such  its characteristics are

262
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,410
obviously to keep an eye on the

263
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,870
resolutions of our device then the

264
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,820
part of tissi p dame that we saw

265
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,960
before

266
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,540
automatically create an interface for

267
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,260
each domain that is

268
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,880
logged by from the domain monitor

269
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,560
print information on how to configure

270
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,340
our proxy in the bar and then two

271
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,860
slightly more particular features that are an

272
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,140
interactive mode that allows us to

273
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,390
choose which domain to intercept

274
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,470
which not

275
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,230
this comes in handy it came in handy

276
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,310
let's say when of the entire device

277
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,080
I wanted to intercept only particular

278
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,070
domains

279
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,200
you think of a phone I want to work

280
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,750
only on an application I don't need to

281
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,790
intercept all the communications that

282
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,920
phone but I want to intercept only

283
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,750
those of those applications

284
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,430
so this mode  it allows me to

285
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,760
say this domain on this other no

286
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,470
finally the possibility of making a backup

287
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,750
is a restore of the configuration

288
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,370
so that if I close the pc at

289
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,070
six in the evening and I leave the office the

290
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,350
next day and return I can withdraw

291
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,480
standing all this ambaradan without the

292
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,280
slightest effort without having to

293
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,460
intercept everything a small

294
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,160
demo of this tool to make you understand

295
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,160
the automation

296
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:51,739
ok then here you see the spot

297
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:53,239
I have created a hot spot called

298
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:57,199
samaritan that is a nandroid a

299
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:58,459
phone of

300
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:00,139
course  this phone to

301
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:02,389
proxy functionality, however, now I

302
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:05,499
will show you that I have a disability or

303
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:09,170
imposed as prox  y the nothing

304
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,769
here I put a not so at this

305
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:15,769
moment I am saying to the device go

306
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,929
quietly to the internet without going

307
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:22,100
through any proxy I start my tool as

308
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,759
parameters I give it the wlan on which

309
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:27,709
the spot is currently lit

310
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:30,649
the ip address of the  device is the

311
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,170
minus mode also allows me to tell the day

312
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,649
to the domain I want to intercept

313
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,879
the example is always that of the courier

314
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:40,850
for which I am now going to

315
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,769
request the courier's site from

316
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:48,559
the device the request for ns has started together with the

317
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:48,949
others

318
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:51,110
to me  interested only courier so I

319
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,879
start saying no no even google

320
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:58,579
courier yes I want to intercept very well

321
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:00,410
the tool is now printing me the

322
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,699
information I need to

323
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,339
configure my proxy so now

324
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:06,169
if this you can also understand how many

325
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:08,059
domains are contacted and from an

326
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:12,319
android phone  as soon

327
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,970
as I have a browser I am not interested in all this I am

328
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,860
only interested in the courier so I am going to

329
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,980
configure port 443 I am going to

330
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,989
configure the interface c  as

331
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:27,139
the tour tells me the real alps redirect ok all the

332
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:29,749
various parameters here I also set the

333
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:32,059
certificate the certified name the same

334
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:35,389
this is one thing is not mandatory

335
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:37,819
but some domains and they go crazy for

336
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:41,919
which every now and then goes to mass every now

337
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,339
and then no and so now refresh went  I am able to

338
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:47,869
intercept the traffic

339
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:49,699
I am praying the device I have

340
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:52,819
placed myself between him and the courier I am able to

341
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:54,739
intercept him I can modify the

342
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:56,240
traffic I am able to do all my

343
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,300
analyzes that I will want to do

344
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,150
and this having seen all the steps above

345
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,490
this my tour practically does them

346
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:12,880
automatically  basically ok ssl I

347
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,800
heard a word sls l then this

348
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,770
tool is not the godsend then there

349
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,890
are conditions before I was talking about

350
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,810
preconditions for the stars the

351
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,180
condition obviously that on the device there

352
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,580
is installed a custom certificate which

353
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,610
is that of bar obviously a '  another

354
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,290
of the conditions that if the device does not

355
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,530
use the dns but goes directly to the p we are

356
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,110
screwed the same if I arc given an ip I

357
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,040
cannot  use the dna while if we are in the

358
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,970
condition of ns no https or I

359
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,820
can install a certificate this

360
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,660
technique works

361
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,890
before closing I leave you with

362
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,730
ideas

363
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:02,149
a bard extension to automate

364
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:04,069
even the last step that is the creation

365
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:05,689
of the proxy

366
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:07,339
I do not have the most  pale idea because I have not

367
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:09,199
had time to find out whether or not there is

368
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,509
an ep ai that allows you to do so, however it

369
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:12,709
could be an excellent

370
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:17,240
future development dns poisoning it could be

371
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,389
an idea or instead of making the

372
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:23,420
change on my local computer I can

373
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:31,240
coexist directly  the answer never

374
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:36,860
paiola majles felt squat could be

375
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,379
integrated yes yes yes

376
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,690
when now the same l ok my

377
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,220
solved before if you do not have a cia

378
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,310
installed inside the device the asl does not

379
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,670
work and the other question instead was if

380
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,770
you know pyol then you start I heard

381
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,520
speak not the details but yes that is

382
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,800
the idea that I have also thought of something

383
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,730
with the library scape scraping

384
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,980
python schemes for which to do something right

385
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,699
all in python and on the fly so logo and

386
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,990
then edit on the fly is an idea

387
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:30,480
unfortunately I don't have much time so ok and

388
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,460
the other idea is python 3 because

389
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,700
currently your impact still two but

390
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,530
unfortunately it will die poor thing and

391
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,960
sorry and therefore  the idea was to bring the

392
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,930
whole python 3 and then obviously

393
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,990
this idea is more than good accept

394
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,800
the tool and sauces tab you can download it

395
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,100
you can do what you want it's free

396
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,650
I hope it can be of help to

397
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,270
someone someone who maybe does my

398
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,710
job  to someone who wants to try

399
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,600
this technique who may not have

400
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,490
known it before wants to try to put it

401
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,000
into practice

402
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,740
to me it has solved many problems

403
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,200
especially when

404
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,250
random devices arrive at work and they tell us tested there

405
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,630
so if there are no questions I

406
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,810
thank you

407
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:25,520
