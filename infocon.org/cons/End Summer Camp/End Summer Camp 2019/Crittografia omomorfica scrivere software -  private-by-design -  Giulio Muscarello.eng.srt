1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
ok hello everyone the title of this talk

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,589
how to use automatic

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:10,530
encryption everything it is and how to use it to write

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,509
software change prices by design

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:18,570
the name is very complex but in reality it is

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,119
a fairly simple feature

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,160
so we will see it calmly

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,609
let's see rather in what  software sense

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,480
includes saint remy design it means

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,009
that I design my software so

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,380
that due to the way it is built I

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,239
cannot violate the privacy of my

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,480
users so a trivial thing can be

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,640
example that a site

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,070
requires more quantitative data is

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,469
strictly necessary  so if there is a

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,780
flash game I do not go to ask the

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,789
tirata thai birth or the tax code

19
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,360
I only ask for a username but and let's see at the

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,910
level of a protocol code

21
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,960
what we can use what was a

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,290
little more known and leave whoever  he

23
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,479
heard that he uses it 123 a little

24
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,520
more the shin is a one-way function

25
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,290
to laugh the user mila a

26
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,310
password

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,229
I throw it in the mythical as  out of

28
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,619
a hexadecimal code after I, however, I

29
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,170
cannot go back so having

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,520
stock this by doing database

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,290
match it happens if an area of an

32
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,979
employee steals my database access only

33
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,290
to these codes nor decimal which however

34
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,030
cannot can not be interested in the password

35
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,680
becomes if I have  need to see if the

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,420
pass of the who road fatigue or in

37
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,399
code with should be right the

38
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,890
password of the user I make it the end

39
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,229
of the nineteenth are the same

40
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,299
here precisely and taken by design because it

41
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,170
guarantees that even if my gift in the

42
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,969
database I protect the socket  and

43
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,189
users because every warehouse I pass

44
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,590
instead a more common example that

45
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,660
we have more often is end

46
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,230
to end photography that is to say no but it happens that

47
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,599
I send clear messages to the servant and

48
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,610
servant will argue with the recipient

49
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,319
with the help els that  I understand the

50
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,300
message they have not computerized to the

51
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,550
server which therefore cannot read it and

52
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,950
he turns it to the destined who decrees

53
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,590
that key that only he also knows  here

54
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,780
and there country goes design lies in the fact that it is

55
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,640
even if it serves that compromise if I am

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,620
not always spied by the di cassino that in the

57
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,330
three messages he cannot

58
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,600
communicate with what someone

59
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,460
else because signed between me and him

60
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,710
who serves in time reading we come to

61
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,840
point what is this photograph or

62
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,130
monographic then it is fundamental that the encore is

63
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,720
used for any, therefore it can be

64
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,110
data without being able to read them

65
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,650
I made a very practical example between

66
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,060
an application that calculates wood that

67
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,740
slaughters that then gains height

68
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,680
takes weight make formuletta  type

69
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,510
weight squared of salvation one thing so

70
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,850
calculate it is played on my computer it

71
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,250
happens that there is an archive register

72
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,950
that height 1 with the weight I did the

73
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,320
sum in the meridi list everything is ok with

74
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,850
encryption a man limbs and when you

75
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,390
cards cards  he is without a photograph on the

76
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,940
stand outside I stating my

77
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,080
height is 80 my weight is 60 kg and

78
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,940
he always does the calculations in clear text

79
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,430
so he can read that I am tall t  odt

80
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,790
what a weight todt that preserved an

81
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,140
alpine falsehood of me I also send them in

82
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,149
clear text with the fc

83
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,790
in short of the acronym as well as the injured

84
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,770
it happens that I have written my

85
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,320
height in particular my weight

86
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,930
in particular I send them to the server

87
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,600
that  he cannot read them but he is able in

88
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,110
some way that in some way to make

89
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,050
the multiplication give me a formula and

90
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,660
calculate this index is also what

91
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,000
happened but then they sent back

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,040
what happened I sent him

93
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,150
data

94
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,430
he performed a function of

95
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,650
which  these data but you can never

96
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,090
ask us directly they can do

97
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,850
calculations and had with output status and then

98
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,950
send it to me it would be nice to explain how it

99
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,980
works let's say never de

100
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,290
paris mathematics feels too complex

101
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,170
for an 18-minute party and among a

102
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,390
general audience for which in short there is no  I go

103
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,180
did if anyone is interested

104
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,210
I then linked the libraries that are used

105
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,030
15 people the papers are traceable

106
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,139
anyway with

107
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:01,039
a background vad  the statistics for the

108
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,219
people of Chieti closed almost statistics

109
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:08,719
anyway let's go back to the point then the

110
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:10,520
server just that it data without

111
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,599
ever completing them reads by analogy it can

112
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:17,900
be 110 a box I can

113
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,370
manipulate things said alone with these gloves

114
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,710
but never pull out  its

115
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,639
content

116
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,379
everything I do remains in this

117
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,659
area that, helped as much as possible, I can send the

118
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:33,169
user what operations I can do, it

119
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,719
turns out that in reality,

120
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:40,430
historically, I study to do everything the

121
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,550
first forms of hedgehogs that were

122
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,610
invented discovered only as

123
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,699
operations  today enchanted for several

124
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:50,169
years

125
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:52,699
we have aifi c algorithms that

126
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,189
can do apply everything so

127
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,589
both I want to make an application that I

128
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:00,740
don't know users not image I change

129
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,330
faces I put a

130
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,970
smile on my face I can

131
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,280
do it because it tries anything  and

132
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,070
I want something that

133
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,740
to exchange messages I send you only

134
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,960
some recipients apply some rules

135
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,860
I can do it is  re all

136
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,260
in the sense that turin complete all or

137
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,250
almost in reality there are exceptions

138
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,860
control flo in the sense that otherwise there

139
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,330
are ways for that area given

140
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,630
clicked an example is very fast and

141
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,010
nothing theoretical a very practical example

142
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,570


143
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,400
let's go back to explanation of the index but

144
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,580
therefore knowing how to put the weight height

145
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,770
if I could do it but I could say

146
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,710
ok I cannot directly give the data but

147
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,680
I can tell if the weight is greater than 80

148
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,710
per hour of her by two minutes six

149
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,390
minors 80 per hour of her by one

150
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,800
second

151
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,620
I then execute my function and I know

152
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,020
how long it takes if who folds two

153
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,840
minutes and I must say that the user weighs more

154
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,300
than 80 kg despite the forced internet

155
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,910
that then the data comes out but it is

156
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,710
mathematically this thing is not

157
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,270
possible also because precisely

158
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,550
otherwise it would be a way of

159
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,380
discovering information on the data first spoke

160
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,680
more than 80 less than 80 to less than 70

161
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,380
less than 70 more

162
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,090
in short, find the data for which you understand

163
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,520
that it should not be possible

164
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,390
and  in fact it is not I

165
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,200
can make a surrogate of the, that is to

166
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,780
make it work anyway in what way

167
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,970
by executing both segments of codes

168
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,190
and making sure that in reality only one

169
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,290
is effective because maybe I save the

170
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,920
temporary variables the copies only if

171
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,220
list is the right one therefore a  a little

172
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,810
unclear, however, I understand in short, I am

173
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,440
eighteen minutes so in any case in

174
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,870
summary what the fic guarantees me

175
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,370
and that I can follow any

176
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,410
algorithm of the cloud any one

177
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,790
asterisk

178
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,160
a mathematical guarantee that my data

179
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,440
cannot be read do what

180
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,260
they like or do  modifying images can

181
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,910
do against heracles power of to

182
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,930
anything but while we see my data we

183
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,740
build the

184
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,120
well dear non-theoretical common to

185
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,470
all this area we see a bit

186
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,889
which are the implementations both as

187
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:34,409
primitives and then on how to actually use them

188
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,370
the best known one

189
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,649
his name is e xp ii and cheerful and the

190
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:47,690
more you know you are not even more

191
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,670
advanced in the case of a star  and the aspired then

192
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,620
precisely as

193
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,240
the eighteenth century mathematician

194
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,670
what interests it is that in level mode,

195
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:05,110
that is to say every operation that makes

196
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,570
every data at a community level every

197
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,550
operation that adds up these

198
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,860
noise levels which therefore sent its own

199
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,620
level and the  problem is that at a certain

200
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,720
point the data that does not threshold so

201
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,010
high to accumulate that they

202
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,190
explained described it is possible to change this

203
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,890
means that in fact I have a limited number of

204
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,480
operations that I can do on every

205
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,140
single data so

206
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,360
but if I choose myself in the commission they

207
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,340
would not be knowing that  for example, on doing

208
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,620
ten operations I can choose a

209
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,860
very high noise for the debts

210
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,500
so much so that operations have been

211
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,390
making a lot of them because very

212
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,540
long keys a very low number in short, a

213
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,600
little is all complexity in the end, however, the

214
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,880
advantage it has is that they are very

215
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,260
fast compared to what we

216
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,910
will see later, which are an arbitration quantity,

217
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,980
the operations are the first

218
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,930
disadvantage if we want to c  hiam it

219
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,850
that made a feature it is this

220
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,820
that very fast operations but also

221
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,960
limited so more than tot I can not

222
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,130
do the second disadvantage is that

223
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,110
ah beautiful and primitive none of the

224
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,810
operations quite complex in

225
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,870
reality simply on the soft opinion

226
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,330
6.000 the documentation I see I see a

227
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,560
hyper cube

228
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,720
I see a presentation network where an

229
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,450
addition tree in short are not

230
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,320
exactly iv and things like that it is not very

231
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,170
easy to use but this more for

232
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,500
a design choice are researchers

233
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,790
have developed species of them I

234
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,800
call it one of the languages for you that

235
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,200
therefore something very  optimized that

236
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,300
works very fast all

237
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,960
but that while much more complex than

238
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,020
more user friendly languages, however,

239
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,930
you know that there exists that the long one

240
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,000
I would say more widespread is also more active

241
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,440
too c.so reverse instead minor

242
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,650
second generation because 21 field and

243
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,820
fines evolution  so with several

244
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,660
generations he made a list of those

245
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,370
even here a little more cone  sciute that is ceo

246
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,960
of microsoft who

247
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,400
joined several different algorithms

248
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,120
poles if I pause too much because in

249
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,100
any case not in the case of psc which

250
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,680
is my favorite partially one of the

251
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,420
best known even if not as for the

252
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,740
skies for me it is preferred for two reasons

253
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,180
first of all because  the primitive that

254
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,400
strips they are not hyper cubes they are not

255
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,920
trees dedication they are not things they are

256
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,840
logical bits for you that a language that

257
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,180
we too cannot manipulate to

258
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,730
have without problems very

259
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,250
intuitively so at 20 and did everything

260
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,010
possible about give me a beat he

261
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,440
said then  to these two fanny

262
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,930
land bits of these bmt piano

263
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,680
somewhere else it is much more understandable but

264
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,410
above all the fact that even this

265
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,300
at noise levels for each bit

266
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,680
only you do in such a way that after

267
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,480
adding them it is able to remove

268
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,410
noise and  he does it after each operation

269
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,390
we will see that something a little uncomfortable in

270
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,430
reality but what interests him and

271
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,230
therefore the cumulated never goes beyond  re the

272
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:23,680
threshold

273
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,930
this means that I can do an

274
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,610
infinite amount of operations on the bits

275
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,250
precisely without problems without

276
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,029
this arbitrary threshold of the loach part

277
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,769
is like having any operation

278
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,709
for which you know that any software

279
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,380
any algorithm anything that

280
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,779
can translate into code of  fact

281
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:48,360
becomes all logical for you and therefore

282
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,120
allows you to implement quite

283
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,240
comfortably as much as possible

284
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,890
almost any almost desperation which in itself is

285
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,779
great with told him precisely I can

286
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,360
do virtually what pays me

287
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:10,560
low you want I can step

288
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,579
discussed low business  that

289
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,200
just read a logic circuit that does

290
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,360
those things and it is an area in which

291
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,040
we have decades of research

292
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,649
we have the tools for the pd we have everything it is

293
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:24,019
very easy to develop what is

294
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:26,250
that deception then why not everyone

295
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,250
uses the fic apart from that it is  little

296
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,700
known is the deception that every quarter

297
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,820
logically 3g milliseconds to execute is

298
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,709
above all a scal  to consider that the

299
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:40,470
processor here will have started and therefore

300
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,470
it takes a few nanoseconds so in

301
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,810
relative terms

302
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,850
we are about 40 million times we are

303
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,899
slower and so if, for example, the calculation

304
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,790
that I am more modest makes me maybe it

305
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,829
does it in a second

306
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:58,230
stone.  maybe he will do it in

307
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,750
twenty years possibly so we understand

308
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,209
that it is not a very

309
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:09,199
easy state for very modest operations

310
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,339
how modest

311
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,120
let's say that I want to add 2 bite very

312
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,110
banal it is done very simply

313
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,860
also as a circuit I am 36 poet and I am

314
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,839
already half a second that  it is not easy to

315
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,449
melt multiply not one but two

316
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:27,060
huts even on the 1700 part of the

317
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,480
circuit and are twenty-two seconds and 22

318
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,949
seconds are people who two integers

319
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:34,230
we understand that it becomes extremely uncomfortable

320
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,630
in applications then in the world they

321
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,040
do not even speak of the flops that

322
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,020
are longer for us circuits  much more

323
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,120
complex to manage exponents mantis

324
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,420
all those things there even the water for

325
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,370
the stand was minutes maybe  god

326
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,130
now just to add them was still

327
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,680
a promising field in which there are

328
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,959
root advancements that are

329
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,230
speeding up so for operations they

330
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,360
are an obstacle but we are getting to

331
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,720
be a little more efficient more

332
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,149
useful for the general case applications

333
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:15,640
what can I do in practice one

334
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,269
once ok

335
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:18,720
i know i can do any

336
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,870
calculation what i can use it most

337
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,260
of the research work nest up with

338
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,959
feasible solutions useful solutions for

339
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,990
this this technology data mining

340
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,560
contempt and respectful of privacy day

341
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,810
tamagni means that i have a great

342
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,370
date  set the data taken from users taken from

343
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,589
statistics what we want and I want to

344
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:46,449
extract some

345
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:48,399
some other some meters

346
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,859
some media some trends that

347
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:52,600
interest me some of the statistics for

348
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,889
which example in practice it happens that I

349
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,970
want a list of academic scores

350
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,869
I want to understand why  people

351
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:07,269
happen to describe themselves after two years

352
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:10,389
because they did not pass the exams is corr  elated

353
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:12,429
perhaps with the fact that they do not have enough

354
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,579
money and sued with the fact that they have

355
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:17,110
health problems because we live in a

356
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,300
certain place nothing is being born

357
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,179
or rather I can delegate it

358
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:23,949
somewhere else without you I can from the germs

359
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,350
given so what is the thing that this

360
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,879
universe  thong that I do not have my

361
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:30,910
computational resources I can tell a to a but

362
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,679
in short microsoft advises and looks at

363
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:35,470
me and do this to me in the statistician tell me if the

364
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,119
one who was born with the state of health

365
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,639
if someone else with money can

366
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,589
do it safely  that guarantee

367
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,899
that he cannot violate the

368
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,850
presence of students because the algorithm

369
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,410
actually prohibits him from doing so obviously in the

370
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,230
current state such a thing is

371
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,610
not not feasible for the times we have

372
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,519
seen but it is an area in which there is a lot of

373
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,019
time  research because once

374
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:03,550
it is feasible in terms of

375
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,799
performance,

376
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,020
the idea that I can

377
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,359
get it in the statistician without

378
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,349
c  he no one can read

379
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,699
delegate it to someone without violating the

380
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:17,679
privacy of users what

381
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,740
will listen to you I still have a field used

382
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,929
let's say here there is a bit of research on how to

383
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:31,080
use them and the field of genetics for which there are

384
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,059
always vices they say

385
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:38,530
let's see if you have  the predisposition to not

386
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,690
only certain diseases happens that he looks

387
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,090
for patterns in the genome and I see

388
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,960
these correspondences that are

389
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,360
predisposition and I could say that a

390
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,860
service in general only that instead of

391
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,920
giving him my DNA in clear and therefore he

392
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,020
can read himself and all the  my genes paul is

393
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,550
already on which predisposition of

394
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,679
polenta on what pays him a

395
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,450
similar service but it was not necessary to

396
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,800
pass my data because by filing the

397
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,140
genome in encrypted form and he with

398
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,650
research part to tell me on what date if I

399
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,510
am predisposed to a disease

400
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,210
rather than  another or hermes are

401
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,500
of European blood

402
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,940
these are the estimates known here third for

403
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,870
example for which I receive the emails I can

404
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,179
send them to another service eg  terno who,

405
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:26,590
however, cannot read e-mails can only

406
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,140
say that my second is spam or not

407
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,060
or the udc thing,

408
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,730
let's say, is a more fascinating one because

409
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,870


410
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,400
we know that many invasions

411
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,800
of privacy in everyday life

412
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,770
are in fact traced back to

413
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,070
advertising.  sites want to obtain data

414
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,460
about you to profile ask for

415
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,690
cubist marketing advertising in fact

416
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,560
open that are worth more with you we

417
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,860
could think of making the parquet

418
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,610
tini so I always respect rumors so

419
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,750
I could say to send my

420
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,060
democracy profiling data to a server that

421
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,870
I bring out the most suitable advertising, the

422
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,210
one that is worth the most,

423
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,650
but without anyone else knowing

424
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,140
which ct visitors

425
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,970
a friend of the most at night during the day if I

426
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,920
often connect from Italy or from the

427
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,450
road and so on in summary  dress

428
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,160
sensitive data on the cloud we think

429
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,920
about clinical data we will do something that is a

430
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,680
platform says doctors there has been a

431
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,350
drop in blood sugar

432
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,690
I can do it very well without a  an

433
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,520
external platform has to tell everything

434
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,430
about the patients or the billing

435
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,700
in practice what we can use

436
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,870
excessive now he wants to

437
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,620
apply on the spot using the fic

438
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,000
what can I do you can

439
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,410
directly use the frames orders I put

440
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,540
the water in the books next buildings and

441
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,630
see  I do my good one which vat

442
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,600
as before that does his subdivision does

443
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,770
what he wants and certainly does the

444
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,120
performances are the best ones

445
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,100
because in fact I use the most

446
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,560
active versions in lot possible in

447
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,960
stability because I can get my hands

448
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,030
on what I am doing

449
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,490
I can use gdb what you pay me

450
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,010
because to pay for the code my

451
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,450
sensitivity here too because

452
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,850
literally it is enough that I can not

453
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,410
so what I do you do not commit an

454
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,210
and me you cannot do it

455
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,040
but I would say that obviously processes races

456
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,820
a long more difficult moment pains to

457
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,530
supper mind that i want something that

458
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,010
calculates me this slaughtering index

459
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,050
looking for me online manual how to design

460
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,930
a cir  cuito that does the multiplication

461
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:58,040
circuit for the division in short

462
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,929
it is not very friendly in short even if it is

463
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:06,740
better than the others so primitive as

464
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,539
well as basic that I have to make the sum

465
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,250
starting with the logic gates that

466
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,360
really a waste of time absurd

467
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,100
what happens vastese for this a star

468
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,410
thousand reached the documentation and

469
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,520
understand

470
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,970
in the case ten books how they want the

471
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,309
data in essence therefore it is feasible

472
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:29,010
people who do it for a search on various

473
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,230
types of algorithms you can only do that

474
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,940
just a little expensive according to

475
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,950
how much lot as kept in

476
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,299
a second  modality

477
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:44,039
that the compilers have developed with

478
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,679
a custom language for this type of

479
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,140
environment for which something that I

480
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,850
told him that it seems a normal then with

481
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,730
all the former nations anything else

482
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,070
here as it translates it into the right circuit in the

483
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,250
right calls  library

484
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,730
the best known example is nun alchemy

485
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,470
beautiful thing that there is very

486
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,600
idiomatic I put my beautiful

487
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,760
then there  think compiler from will understand

488
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,960
what I had to do

489
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,340
to change variable what I have to

490
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:17,440
take thinks about it he said ends

491
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,399
which means he can know the noise

492
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:23,049
of how much a fiction story will always grow

493
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,520


494
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,890
he knows how much the community changes and

495
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,809
for those ordinary powers and  the

496
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:31,390
operations so that it is lower and therefore I can

497
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,600
afford operations adds us

498
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,809
that less noise in that of the lake rhythm

499
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:41,500
had some technical support to

500
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,179
mean different back ends there is a pc it

501
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:48,159
would take a separate talk not only to

502
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,429
talk about it in  which he has done is that it is a

503
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:56,230
technology that also allows the same

504
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,809
characteristics to do calculations in a private way

505
00:22:58,809 --> 00:22:59,830


506
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,809
only instead of doing it on a single

507
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:05,890
host and it does so through a series of lost

508
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,059
that communicate with each other

509
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,450
with that point that supports different

510
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,970
backend chances there  it is me to do it maybe

511
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,159
that is clear so to announce a moment

512
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,059
what can I do strips fill it in with

513
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:23,860
balance I can do the double and that it is

514
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,259
more difficult to have to  certainly say

515
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:28,700
that by scrolling a check I what is

516
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,409
produced and the compiler that you can

517
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,649
what to do if if a bug occurs I want to

518
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:35,360
see like now but stand there and

519
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,039
read me all the compiler see

520
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,769
where it is wrong to translate my

521
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:41,990
call it was wrong it was  if I

522
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,659
am wrong so I am missing the tools however the

523
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:46,879
matter that gdb as I normally do

524
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:47,990
with binary

525
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,520
I look at the spaak transmigrated everything I

526
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,620
am certainly more limited than the

527
00:23:53,620 --> 00:24:00,160
level of lead bug the third in the field

528
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,810
on this actually working a few

529
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,630
years when I then became interested  to

530
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,680
iii which is that of libraries, that is,

531
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,600
instead of writing directly or

532
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,380
indirectly, the

533
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,080
indirectly pathological backend scheck is all the

534
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,860
library that has already implemented it for

535
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:25,750
this the most famous crawler supporters

536
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,660
and I am working instead on black box

537
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,230
which is a metaphor on the on  box with

538
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,300
gloves inside

539
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,760
so going back to first the point is if

540
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,500
you do it for example

541
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,230
a sum of no need  or that I am going to

542
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,420
look for myself how to do diction the

543
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,100
library that only the circuit is implemented

544
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,170
and manages everything tradition to

545
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,610
say that there may be apples without

546
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:55,300
kin loops there may be are a little

547
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,780
complicated it has everything I

548
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,490
need anyway some

549
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,000
as a language  de bac skill and

550
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,080
good in the sense that in the end everything with

551
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,600
the circles plus more in this case so

552
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,710
I can see directly what it is

553
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,660
called I can use the classic tours

554
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,200
so an id a debugger made more

555
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,950
works however in general

556
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,179
or the tours I need

557
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:27,130
do not  it is the same thing that the

558
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,250
functions directly but it is certainly very

559
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,330
appreciable classic library even here

560
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,160
I can use different back ends because it does not

561
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,960
change kata mind the functions

562
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,360
interest me because I can say it works

563
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,100
plain text mode so he

564
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,770
pretends that it pays off in reality it does not  there is

565
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,360
only one pathological normal these reservations

566
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,330
if I want to verify my

567
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,830
right function code I do it in plain text

568
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:55,080
I see  if it works if yes I do it

569
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,189
facilitated that it takes more time

570
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:03,340
then anger of love operation of

571
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,850
abstractions that certainly better than

572
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,290
you did not have it precisely with the

573
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:11,440
logical parts a hand only creates associations that are

574
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,260
not always idiomatic and for example I see

575
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,770
if I have some code here  its at hand

576
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,889


577
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,990
[Music]

578
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,490
for example it has accustomed us

579
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,280
to classical languages to do my beauty in

580
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,540
condition to do something else it is

581
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,040
something else very

582
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,290
simple are three little words the library is finished

583
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:26,290
we said that I cannot

584
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,700
have the unusual ones for which  to be

585
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,590
implemented then a little by hand and

586
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,820
this I want not to pass my

587
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,280
bellis all normal that is ii was a

588
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,899
complicated means so one asks that

589
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:38,679
the star the deal the lips even more

590
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:40,720
close or be careful to use the mas

591
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,210
which is a stuff that  it is used to emulate

592
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,659
beautiful linson abstractions but they are not

593
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:48,639
also this and very comfortable to use but

594
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:50,990
surely they

595
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:57,440
are a useful help now I see if for

596
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,640
example that I can tell him simple  emente

597
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,640
where it is

598
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,030
possible simply I want an

599
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,510
8-bit integer in topless dyed which 9

600
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,370
and then he takes care of telling me but where

601
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,550
do they put the data how is the encryption

602
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,540
smile at me make him the soma I just owe him

603
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:27,030
a whole plus plus something and yes it is

604
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,190
already  evening alone all the

605
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,620
complexity

606
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,060
let's go back to first then all the

607
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,540
documentation then if you intend

608
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,050
to give us an eye that in the end

609
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,730
completely appreciable I am also not a

610
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,980
bet from a mathematician that is it is done

611
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,550
on

612
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,580
purpose I developed it with ida that does not  must

613
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,620
keep up with particular mathematical complexity

614
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,210
that still exist but I

615
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,400
am here as researchers instead something

616
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,580
that is more useful because a

617
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,290
developer who does not have the experience in

618
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,150
these things I would not even want to have

619
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,220
them simply because I want to

620
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,770
develop my own beautiful application that deals with the

621
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,960
given a little bit of law on this

622
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,970
we say so relatively

623
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,470
quickly about this thing a little

624
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,499
a little addition that I'm listed

625
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:27,299
on ten  themes previously reported fernando and

626
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,720
at the moment it is not the case to use it in

627
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,490
applications and real bonds if you

628
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,369
feel like an island for use in the company I use it

629
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:37,679
for my things because it does not use

630
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,299


631
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,879
random lion generators safe from the cryptographic point of

632
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:44,100
view that is quite

633
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,909
predictable  so he doesn't have all the

634
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:50,340
security he says he has because using me

635
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,619
who are not completely random this

636
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:55,230
will be fixed quite easily

637
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,389
but know in case you have the obsession

638
00:29:57,389 --> 00:30:00,840
to develop something anyway on get

639
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,460
up so read everything it's not a

640
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,139
problem just a little out of time  but

641
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,679
in short, they are 11 so a little after the

642
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,480
right one last time overview

643
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,909
of what are the problems safety

644
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:17,180
let's say so on

645
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,570
the fic these species are general among

646
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,160
other things they are not even specific to

647
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,500
individuals without they are in sit in how it

648
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,930
works  it is all based on the fact that the

649
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:32,120
data thing is malleable always

650
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,190
deciding to change a bit for something

651
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:43,280
it can do by combining a bit with

652
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,920
notes says sp  it gets

653
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,740
Central European which has always placed use bo1 they

654
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,090
cannot be for their content it has

655
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,590
always married it replace them with a

656
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,220
constant and there is a

657
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,640
vulnerability class which are 6 i.e.

658
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,340
I have a beat that I want to know I

659
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,600
do not know what value it has however  the echoes I

660
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,780
always replace it with zeal and let

661
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,960
's see what happens if I guessed then the

662
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,970
calculations are identical because that bit but

663
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,590
it actually goes 0

664
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,200
and does not write anything if instead it

665
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,450
did not want 0 it was worth 1 cards that all the

666
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,160
calculations from onwards will be wrong

667
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,360
in peace  he says here this thing is not

668
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,810
okay to do the calculation again so file

669
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,000
realizes and from this he is possessed technician

670
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,550
the beat was one made a single bit

671
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,800
face on a sequence I can get the

672
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,630
value of a sufficient data based on

673
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,840
how reding shiplight and are the  rise

674
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:45,380
natal because it is complicated and there is no

675
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,090
knee time

676
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,300
another second and last last

677
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,300
class so last last slide we are

678
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,620
like this is that of us

679
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,809
to those special cases it happens that

680
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:06,460
we assume that it is a statistical body

681
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,230
I would like to know how many

682
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,960
overweight people are in the city of

683
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,690
milan do you make this calculation nothing

684
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,150
external and then for the public and this

685
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:23,090
percentage what has been discovered so

686
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,520
we can say is  it was discovered that it is used

687
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,740
to clean but I do not know precisely those

688
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,950
strange outputs but I can say I do

689
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,660
output if I want me to know

690
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,440
if I am more on and / or diabetes I can

691
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,500
tell if diabetes then lido in such an

692
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,650
equal percentage if I

693
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,280
do not have it  has and of spa that I can do it comfortably so that I can

694
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,020


695
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,240
manipulate all the bits that I think I

696
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,250
cannot read too much about manipulating them

697
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,760
with my father

698
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,660
the statistics body does not notice

699
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,360
because it does not know if they are 10 percent 11

700
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,040
percent cost  first

701
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,410
circle this way as he publishes

702
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,140
results to me I see that is how many 21 percent

703
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,660
and odd for which diabetes I

704
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,460
used the made an exchange published those

705
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,280
data com  and it's called an hour and pauline

706
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,520
pretending to photograph to find out

707
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,320
something about the data that interest states

708
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:27,250
three was enough in a very

709
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,950
very vast and somewhat superficial overview of this

710
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:36,700
world over so if you have doubts questions

711
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,090
things

712
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:50,589
