1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,260
hi thank goodness there is rain

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,640
at least there is a lot of people I did not

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,250
expect so many people and I'm

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,410
diego I'm part of the metro the

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,760
graphics is just a programmer and at the

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,640
moment I'm studying machine learning

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,640
on my own trust diversity I have  made

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,949
a thesis on this topic what

9
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:26,499
I will talk about today is that spunk inter

10
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:28,720
using machine learning

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,159
those who know it at the bottom

12
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:33,040
learning have heard about it

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,980
ok those who really use it ok so

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,640
if I say [ __ ] I can correct me

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,500
then what is machine learning

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,390
machine learning one thing that

17
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,399
nowadays we hear it everywhere the

18
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,210
spoken word even without back for facebook on

19
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,730
exposed in practice is a set of

20
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,969
techniques and methods and mathematical statistical analyzes

21
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:58,600
that help us to

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,699
process data to have the bus

23
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:03,159
machine learning but very very well on

24
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,830
a goal a very specific problem

25
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,660
and a razor blade

26
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,420
in the sense that type how did you see it

27
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,980
maybe the recognition  nto of images there

28
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,540
are certain pd images that can

29
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,940
be seen very well by machine

30
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,900
learning

31
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,940
but others can be seen very badly

32
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,070
but Chileans is good for the

33
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,700
specific purpose of pouring out the problem that shows you

34
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,690
today to classify spam

35
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,890
ok feel and I take away  this

36
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,650
ok the problem you are talking about today and

37
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,410
classify spam for spam

38
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,690
I mean how you know all spam and who

39
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,880
arrives by e-mail via any other

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,850
communication wool specifically the

41
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,560
play of classifying spam would be to

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,480
understand if an object is part of a

43
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,480
given category or another in

44
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,220
the spam practice we have 2 category

45
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,520
if it is spam or it is not spam in other practices

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,740
in other ways we could have more

47
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,690
category for example if one thing is red

48
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,910
green blue yellow and we could have a

49
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,190
machine learning system that  it

50
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,199
helps us to classify this thing to

51
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,410
categorize here you can see

52
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,180
an image we have a

53
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,910
Cartesian axis on which we divide and our

54
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,420
data our data is fat  ti of objects

55
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,830
similar to fruit

56
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,050
you can see that there is an apple there is a

57
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,370
pear there is the apple logo on the left

58
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,780
we put a certain feature

59
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,090
on the y axis instead we put another

60
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,459
feature and we create a scheme

61
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,330
based on this the  our classification is valid

62
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,430
in this case then the classification

63
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,190
is an apple or a pear you can see that

64
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,650
there is a set installment and this area

65
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,470
is our set of

66
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,570
recognized objects you can see that the

67
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,820
external apple logo because it is not

68
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,310
recognized as a  real and profit

69
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,290
instead you can see that on the

70
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,170
left side there is the apple for those who

71
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,700
recognized how I am marked in

72
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,550
red instead on the right side there is

73
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,290
the pear and they are recognized in blue

74
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,720
this type of graph shows us how it

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,489
is  our classifier works

76
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,470
and as it is showing that our

77
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,810
hypothesis can be divided into different

78
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,739
categories

79
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,950
in this case the categories are two the

80
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,950
line that divides this graph is

81
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,769
a line that shows  how

82
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:31,830
our algorithm or our model works

83
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,620
if we want to be more precise in

84
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,330
practice the more this

85
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,180
detailed line goes around the elements the

86
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,970
more it works only on this

87
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,600
problem

88
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,000
the more a line instead cut for

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,220
example was only an oblique line the

90
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,710
less it works  on our

91
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,140
elements that is if we give too much data

92
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,400
the algorithm gets too used to this

93
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,290
data and we go into the problem of over

94
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,390
fitting if instead we give too little

95
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,010
data our algorithm would not

96
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,990
work well and instead we are in the first

97
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,480
under fitting  we have to find

98
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,040
the precise way for our cry to

99
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,970
work almost always

100
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,010
now let's talk about spam let's see

101
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,079
spam works are all m as you know not

102
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,120
requested by us it is very important a

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,690
big big cost to society and

104
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,660
a lot of money is spent to

105
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,920
destroy it  spam

106
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,840
i dont know if you know why the combined

107
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,100
investment fund

108
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,230
founder paul graham did a lot

109
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,570
of  money creating the first

110
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,790
scalable working pulse fan filter in the world

111
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,410
on spam e-mail filters are therefore

112
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,820
a switchboard filter

113
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,880
spam we said it and we are in the face of the

114
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,730
play in this way we have a dataset

115
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,410
that would be the set of our data

116
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,690
this from if we find in two parts one

117
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,850
part will be called 3 in set and the other

118
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,630
test set

119
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,450
the trend set are all those data and

120
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,760
we ask our algorithm in training

121
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,520
instead the test set are all

122
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,410
those data with which we test our

123
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,680
algorithm we can also  divide it in

124
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,010
more ways but it is a more advanced thing in

125
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,340
this case it is not necessary

126
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,470
we have this we will show in the

127
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,660
type of spam filter it says ham

128
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,590
is spam

129
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,590
am when it is okay it spreads when it is

130
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,040
false I used a dataset with

131
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,140
spam and sms

132
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,790
can there  be a lot of 7 different i

133
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,870
could take it on pictures on email on

134
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,310
sms

135
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,530
i took sms just for simplicity

136
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,900
because the messages much shorter

137
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,270
because i liked to waste time and to f  are

138
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,430
computation in more

139
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,890
as you can see for example in a but there

140
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,440
are normal

141
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,500
messages and that we are messages so the same

142
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,280
but in spam

143
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,620
there is for example the returns in two weeks

144
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,620
comp win or for example the first massacre

145
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,400
and the darling free weeks xxx

146
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,070
this  for example they can be

147
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,630
ways that we humans can understand

148
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,540
why there is a is a spam

149
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,840
message a message we give then for example

150
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,550
we can of elements love us a model

151
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,870
my thing comes to mind let's say for

152
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,250
example all spam emails there

153
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,550
they have xxx made year xxx inside it

154
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,870
means that they spread because we were

155
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,510
going to the porn instead for example if

156
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,810
there is inside

157
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,150
good morning good night good evening are

158
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,830
normal things we can say for

159
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,440
simplicity let's say if there is and these

160
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,400
words if ex credit free call kiss times

161
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,430
airbox  then if home is spam

162
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,790
otherwise olive the normal we make an

163
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,610
algorithm we make it work and

164
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,180
we get this result on 300 samples

165
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,940
245 right 55 wrong who is very cool

166
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,430
i  the sense is a lot right and

167
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,560
very few mistakes but what is the

168
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,760
problem with our model that works

169
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,070
only on fixed words

170
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,260
for example if we put the dots on xxx in the middle it

171
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,479
does not work anymore it will give

172
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,300
many more errors so we cannot

173
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,720
actually recognize it will be fine there

174
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,940
are  mathematical models this here the

175
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,389
filter na if by and that is a

176
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,080
Bayesian filter this of this model the

177
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,790
mathematical model given by the statistic

178
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,120
from the Bayesian statistic stains and

179
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,850
works in this way

180
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,250
I say what the probability that better

181
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,960
in ranking them ta as ham or spam and I

182
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,030
can  calculate based on the features

183
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,250
of the model for fitch all I mean

184
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,320
characteristics sorry data features

185
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,690
that is I mean the

186
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,160
characteristics that the given element has in input these

187
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,030
characteristics then the wizard in my

188
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,150
model is I understand if the characteristics work well

189
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,190
and I can tell them to

190
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,840
hand as we have seen before for

191
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,990
example xxx sex and so on or

192
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,570
I can make them pren  give alone the

193
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,010
characteristics can be of

194
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,080
different types can be tight

195
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,479
numbers elaborations that we can do

196
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:16,360
on them in practice and Bayesian filter

197
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,800
says this

198
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,530
those probability that my data is

199
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,460
estimated as a spam is given by the

200
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,910
probability that a priori he will be called

201
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,120
oedipus spam  o ham for the probability

202
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,130
of each element is present

203
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,320
within the data i.e. for each

204
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,059
of the features for each of the features

205
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,580
I see if that feature is present in

206
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,470
mine

207
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,500
in the spam hook collections in this

208
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,540
way I can understand if

209
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,330
a  another model for example the

210
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,850
moral network the rural network is based on an

211
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,600
abstraction of the human or animal neuron

212
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,480
if we want to say it and there are different ways

213
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,910
to classify through it

214
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,790
the most used model of the per set with

215
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,420
which this different inputs a state and who  it is

216
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,850
called idem it is an output state the

217
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,730
inputs receive the data we can put as

218
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,860
many inputs as there are our

219
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,340
characters  tics of the data a ditto state

220
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,470
that instead manages all these

221
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,590
characteristics and abstracts and the value and

222
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,120
at the end there is an output way that says

223
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,040
or that based on what received in

224
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,710
the well elaborated node I can tell you if it is

225
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,650
amo or spam

226
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,650
in the  practice this an input that is

227
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,010
passed through and of the sums each input

228
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,980
there is a weight is passed to the state

229
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,070
laughing that a mathematical function is carried out

230
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,100
that could be

231
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,350
the summation but also stuff is more

232
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,030
complicated and well past an

233
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,860
activation function there is  in the database a

234
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,980
past input and in the stand where it

235
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,980
is processed activate a certain

236
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,140
function this function based on the

237
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,689
project I can decide if it is spam

238
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,100
then we calculate the performance now and

239
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,190
use of the metrics the

240
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,920
uncle's metrics and precision there are several

241
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,510
meters are used  in machine learning

242
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,960
that is for example precision recall f1 and

243
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,300
there is the mrs

244
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,840
depends on what we want to do I

245
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,670
also set a baseline what I mean by

246
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,260
beslan interface la indig  or the

247
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,670
most stupid approach is what we said

248
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,070
about the characteristics and based on

249
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,220
fixed strings so xxx if ex and so

250
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,690
on

251
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,460
the baseline is very important because the

252
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,220
thing is fast and costs zero we

253
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,080
want to do it 5 and maybe it works better

254
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,620
than the others  and how to tell you or that we

255
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,850
have an ecommerce

256
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,279
in which we come only the first twenty

257
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,709
elements it makes sense to make a

258
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:04,230
recommendation value on this

259
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,660
actual baseline depends on taking the top

260
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,089
ten best sellers and then we do the

261
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:10,740
same comparison with a

262
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,180
recommendation system the tests  on all

263
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,639
our elements if the baseline of

264
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,170
the e-commerce system works better

265
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,880
there is no sense it has to put a

266
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,620
much more complicated system that must be

267
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,139
maintained therefore the need and very

268
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,509
important to do in bisenzio

269
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,970
we have for example 245 currents 55

270
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,069
wrong with the networks  neural we have

271
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:31,740
267 correct and 33 wrong in the same

272
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,500
way with bayern

273
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,750
now the problem is the approach we

274
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,370
have had with us  some of them that is

275
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,930
the baseline was the fastest thing

276
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,100
because it does a comparison on the

277
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,079
strings and really so it takes a

278
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,329
moment the networks in oral instead different

279
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,130
are very heavy they need a

280
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,449
lot of cpu calculation and it is difficult to

281
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:52,920
interpret them as it is  they are based on

282
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,329
mathematical functions that we

283
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:57,480
cannot have knowledge of and also because

284
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,279
you need to have a real system

285
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,680
that you have to keep instead the vice

286
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,639
the same way it is very fast and has almost

287
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,009
zero cost the problem is always that there is

288
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:10,620
a function behind it  that maybe we

289
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,110
could not understand so if

290
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,430
we are actually satisfied with

291
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,870
the baseline it could be

292
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,329
fine our case we could make a spam

293
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:21,470
filter in which it says if you see xxx it is spam it

294
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,959
would be fine for us now

295
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,269
but the thing comes after we have created the

296
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:28,980
model by taking them from  gave if

297
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,589
we understood what we have to

298
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:32,639
do with them we got what we wanted

299
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,980
that is we can classify them if it's spam

300
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,160
or me  no how we continue from which the

301
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,259
speed of execution absolutely

302
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,600
because you have to understand how fast it is

303
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,630
that is if a model takes ten

304
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,910
seconds to understand if a spam email or not

305
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,870
or a text message expose it is too much it must

306
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,120
take less than a second

307
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,529
we can add a soul  dell there

308
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:57,180
are other classification models such as

309
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,569
for example there are the following planning

310
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:03,149
if someone has heard it depend because

311
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,220
if our model or the baseline

312
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,680
works in the same way it is the same

313
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,350
from the same performances it makes no sense to

314
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,250
add new robs

315
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,320
we have to waste time work when

316
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,750
we have it  same result

317
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,710
we try to add other data

318
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,420
absolutely yes we have to add a

319
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,490
life and understand how it works on our

320
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,430
model understand how much the output changes

321
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,160
compared to the import and understand if with

322
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,140
37 we passed at the beginning we

323
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,610
also get the same result on a new

324
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,370
test set

325
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,209
we improve our models and

326
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:36,399
study them yes absolutely because we need to

327
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,279
understand how they work  things

328
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,660
what starts what we take at

329
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,790
speed precision and speed

330
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,310
you have to make a trade off you make

331
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,860
curves you understand where the right is

332
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:53,740
wrong and we decide what to do if you have

333
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,890
any questions about machine learning

334
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:05,250
I have about the presentation itself yes here

335
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:16,600
ok type of software technologies musi

336
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,970
mainly for drugs

337
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,270
then arc klaus that the big

338
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,740
depends you have to do for asked to do

339
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,930
recognition on strings it makes no

340
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,150
sense to go on enough because

341
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,060
simple simple algorithm of 10 miles is enough to

342
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,170
import a library and it works the

343
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,150
same way then  to also think about the

344
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,400
cost of the infrastructure because it is said that

345
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,560
I unmade on my node locally makes

346
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,200
sense but it works for you it fits in a

347
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,170
company maybe you take more no of this

348
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,620
costs it costs time server what

349
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,520
I used and python because it is a lot  a lot and

350
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,290
used in this field of ranchi

351
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,870
used a lot r for statistical analysis

352
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,930
or it depends you can

353
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,029
then go for the speed if  with speed there is

354
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:03,010
a lot of robben java a lot of stuff

355
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,579
in c plus plus vito

356
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:09,710
rubino I tell you because every day

357
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,840
for example spamassassin is

358
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,010
done internally yes it is ruby unfortunately not

359
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,110
I tell you because every day unfortunately there

360
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,850
is not  nothing in python a lot really

361
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,600
a lot but it always depends on what

362
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,710
your goal is the example if I have to go

363
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,400
to the classic machine learning

364
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,500
now any language cia everything

365
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,120
but for example we are going to the

366
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,010
planning that after a little more advanced

367
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,160
you have to go  on stuff in python

368
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,460
or in c plus plus in c because

369
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,080
there are always frameworks as well as tens

370
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,540
of law that use only one stuff

371
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,330
or for example even now scales for

372
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,380
quite a few years and I the software that I

373
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,810
immediately put in the end l  'I scored

374
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,300
just for my whim because it

375
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,450
amused me talking but using

376
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,400
whatever you want

377
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,470
then there is obviously we want to implement

378
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,870
the problem of then asking

379
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,580
how much the implementation is true because

380
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,570
it is  send us some mathematics under a lot 8

381
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,770
building sometimes to understand does not

382
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,380
even know how your model works it is

383
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,730
difficult to say if you did well or

384
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,780
badly

385
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,810
but my project only goes a little

386
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,070
pushed the object does not interface on

387
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,990
that it was only one  try to

388
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,430
interface on the set

389
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,530
in practice just take the

390
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,220
esp bus to massino and excuse a daemon and

391
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,770
mail interface with the project in

392
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,280
all then in output i.e. the same the

393
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,530
same thing only

394
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,220
this interface would be needed but in itself

395
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,660
what  you want to do apart in the sense that it is a

396
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,080
demon that they communicate and more interesting

397
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,630
for me sincerely the approach to these

398
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,540
things that is to see the data and how they change

399
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,170
the training of your model on the known

400
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,339
understand how for example always example

401
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,990
this model could be fine

402
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,349
and for sms but suleiman could

403
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,230
really suck you have to see

404
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,730
that too

405
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,079
and as I said before, machine learning

406
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,170
is fine but for a specific goal

407
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,250
I try to adapt for example this

408
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,290
thing on the emails could go wrong the

409
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,760
words I did it

410
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,240
depends

411
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,120
here is another question

412
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,150
no

413
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:53,700
ok basically makes a plot for free your

414
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,960
data and you understand where the threshold

415
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,370
is it depends yes there are also

416
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,130
automatic procedures there are tests  automatic

417
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,890
that do this but mostly you see it

418
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,390
in a graphic way it is much much

419
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,830
simpler you can understand it because there is

420
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,090
always the threshold that the machine or

421
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:23,000
can see someone else questions

422
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:35,780
ok I have finished my tab

423
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,040
if you want  have a chat

424
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,600
later they are a thousand unfortunately I did not make

425
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,240
a full presentation because

426
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,100
in 18 minutes not to promise everything

427
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,590
and more but must have been wise

428
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,149
at least on this thank you
