1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,430
hello everyone alessandro tanasi I'm

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,280
alessandro I don't think you care what

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,440
I do so we are quick

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,360
we will talk about digital images it is a little

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,400
bit we will introduce everything

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,380
you know is that it hides behind the

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,470
photographs and images and artifacts of

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,619
various types or digital

9
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,270
let's start because they tell me  that it is nice to

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,160
entertain public with a nice

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,549
quizzone so in your opinion this in the

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,390
real photo a false photo

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,140
exact the grandmother with the hamster I tell

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,940
the internet says that this photo is true

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,920
that the hamster nor the grandmother is

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,660
really grown true this exact

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,660
this is false  because the third launch

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,070
the year pasted over

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,420
in reality that missile there never

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,930
started so in short, it is difficult from

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,820
photography to understand whether an image to a

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,649
real content or an artfully made twisted contribution

23
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:06,200


24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,390
what is the problem

25
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,600
nowadays  from friends on snap shot to

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,159
friends on facebook to friends on

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,380
twitter there are friends everywhere or friends

28
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,350
everywhere with photographs so and

29
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,080
we are  o interested in understanding how

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,820
true these photos are and

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,120
how much they want to fool us because

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,560
with technology nowadays and with the

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,820
fact that all those who have a

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,780
reflex camera are professional photographers

35
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,369
manipulating the photographs is very easy

36
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,510
agreement it is very difficult there  there are many

37
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,290
formats many vehicles and many sources

38
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,430
from which we receive photographs or the like it is

39
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,280
he who is a human being per se he believes a

40
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,130
bit of everything unfortunately I have many

41
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,960
times digital photographs are

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,409
used as an initial document to

43
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:03,149
draw other conclusions investigations

44
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,710
journalism uses of euro enforcement

45
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,699
cross processes  judicial is a bit

46
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,480
more so it is interesting to understand how much

47
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,360
a photo we see that comes to us is

48
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,620
real or not what comes to the aid

49
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,200
of forensics which is a science of

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,450
image analysis with cash

51
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,150
branches that deal with many

52
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,090
different things  from extracting data to

53
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,190
authenticating images to making them truthful

54
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,140
what interests us and in this talk

55
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,940
in  introduction to the authentication of

56
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,769
images or we are interested in

57
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:43,420
understanding if this photo is true

58
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,140
perhaps who sent it to us so it is

59
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,940
always possible to do it with a

60
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,480
very high degree of security no because in

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,319
forensic science

62
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,310
a bit like security for every

63
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,750
attention that  is an investigator can

64
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,319
use there is the adequate counter move so that

65
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,299
you can have a reasonable degree of

66
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:08,890
certainty which must obviously be

67
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,660
commensurate with the use I was making of it true we

68
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,639
practically trust what is possible to

69
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,900
do it was for quick overview

70
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,450
obviously this would be a lot of talk

71
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,290
long

72
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,870
first thing to do when we get

73
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,609
an image and this would already be used to

74
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:29,470
notice many things such as

75
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,030
viral

76
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,550
that happen when there are natural disasters

77
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,740
where there are random people who post

78
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,709
on twitter for example photos of poor

79
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,540
children running in the  the way is to

80
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,520
take the image, slam it on google

81
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,890
and do what is called reivers search

82
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,780
or search if those images already

83
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,010
existed before

84
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,390
it was already lurking somewhere else

85
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,610
before it turns out that maybe

86
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,440
that image there was the flood of

87
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,530
2010 denies the classroom to say and already this is

88
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,860
so many journalists did it this there

89
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,590
would be much less you do closed because

90
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,340
often in the event

91
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,489
in a hurry to publish  something

92
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:11,280
these draw randomly from n

93
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,330
various twitter social sources they take everything for

94
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,680
true because hell another computer sees it

95
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,608
and true they post they write the thing

96
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,060
from via the chain for which google is your

97
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,180
friend your friend and certainly no limit

98
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,870
can do aversa search is loading

99
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,570
the image, i.e. starting from the rl, there

100
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,790
are also various other engines that

101
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,080
index the images on the final internet for good or bad

102
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,770


103
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,930
1 and do similar searches

104
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,479
in this case use all of them then if you

105
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,210
fail open the first step move on to

106
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,700
a more complicated analysis

107
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,889
there  take the photo era and sail look

108
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:58,050
many times even the

109
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,840
simple considerations of a poor man who do not understand

110
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,840
anything about technologies can reveal

111
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,770
a  false because while it is very easy for

112
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,680
example to falsify an image it is very

113
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,100
difficult to create the shadow correctly

114
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,740
ok taking into account the light source so

115
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,830
that in an image it is verified if

116
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,560
the shadow is present in each object it is

117
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,180
identified where the source can be  of

118
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,490
light based on the light source you go

119
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,520
to draw the direction and extent

120
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,960
of the shadows many times this too is

121
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,780
enough for example

122
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,639
of the moon oh well there are a whole series

123
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,979
of speculations about we went we did not go there

124
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:45,630
I leave the searches to you

125
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,430
the concept is look at the shadows don't

126
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,900
look only and shadows look also

127
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,110
reflections are very important

128
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,210
reflections i know on the glasses the reflections

129
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,380
in the eyes

130
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,139
many times even looking only the

131
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:01,270
direction in which people look in

132
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,860
a photo usually everyone looks at the

133
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,889
photographer if c  'one looking

134
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,860
left one looking

135
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,020
right it can be a problem in

136
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,930
fact this was american a photo of

137
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,820
american idol i know that stuff d  the

138
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,120
domains did not have time to get

139
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,370
together all together to take the photo they

140
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,720
took four separate photos they

141
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,250
glued them together

142
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,949
if you want look at the eyes at all they

143
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,810
have different reflections all have a

144
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,090
different orientation than the photographer

145
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,010
then they stuck it together

146
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,639
everything there is the photo  even if this

147
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,229
fails you have to give a little bit about the

148
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:40,770
technician the cameras

149
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,030
very old speech everyone knows

150
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,250
in addition to the photo c insert a

151
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,110
lot of metadata that describes

152
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,840
the image the orientation and bla bla bla

153
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,349


154
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:54,099
bla your thumbnail first interesting thing

155
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:55,840
than reality not many  they know the editing

156
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,560
of photos

157
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,409
many times add or modify these

158
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:02,800
metadata so go and look at them

159
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,780
we could simply indicate and that it has

160
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,669
been edited with photoshop because in

161
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:08,650
photoshop when it saves it writes to us from

162
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,599
observed at that hour lipsi I am

163
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,169
in shock  after they contain only the

164
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,419
gray fingers location you know very well take

165
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,349
a picture you see where the h

166
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:21,430
very normal year one of the interesting things

167
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,770
instead that the tags

168
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,409
are often custom that is every vendor or

169
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:28,599
camera to a set of

170
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:32,500
proprietary tags that adds in the photo

171
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,790
taken by the canon eos model far away

172
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,420
then the canon that model makes it so it

173
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,760
is a signature of that machine

174
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,500
photographic

175
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,460
if something is missing from that photo it

176
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,630
means that it was not that it was not

177
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,850
made or with that camera or that it

178
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,090
sat artifact because you can have

179
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,070
a fine print database

180
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,060
of cameras in which

181
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,070
you can identify all the tags

182
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,130
placed by a  from a type of machine for

183
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,370
which this error is quite convenient

184
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,080
to understand if we are facing a fake

185
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,220
or not obvious nor metadata there is also the

186
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,050
ge location but the geolocation

187
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,450
is not only the metadata obvious it is hidden

188
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,980
gps nice easy but many times the  ge

189
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,630
location can come from other things

190
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,190
even if talking to people or

191
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,540
interfacing the data we have in the

192
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,299
photo with other data such as google

193
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,760
street view google maps because maybe in

194
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,289
a photo there is a sign

195
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,390
a distinctive sign something

196
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,059
we look for references to

197
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,590
contextualize the photo in space on

198
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,260
other sources

199
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,000
google street is really very useful

200
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,480
in this case here even if this

201
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,180
fails you go on really

202
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,360
complicated things even a  little about mathematics

203
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,430
in the sense that each camera sensor

204
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,070
leaves its

205
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,320
fingerprint of how photography does of

206
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,330
how it interprets the image and makes it

207
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,050
digital each lens can add

208
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,240
factors due to the problems of the

209
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,500
lens and the distortions of

210
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,330
aberrations.

211
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,100
finger print database

212
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,140
and sensors that also help you

213
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,620
to identify the type of camera

214
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,410


215
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,280
so

216
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,090
a little bit analysis but what

217
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,110
mathematics of the thing could

218
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,000
help you to give me an extra factor on the

219
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,380
certainty or not of the machine of the

220
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,670
machine

221
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,590
obvious this united  to everything else

222
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,470
because there are many small elements that

223
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,010
you put together  and

224
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,130
another thing is the properties of the image

225
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,160
in the sense that the property the photo is in

226
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,260
itself carries with it properties many

227
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,370
times in a photo it can happen that a

228
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,230
woman in a photo, for example, I know

229
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,270
a grove is taken and copied

230
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,920
pasted from  other part of the photo

231
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,890
so there is a duplicate of an area

232
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,420
in the photo is what is called more to the

233
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,470
clone to sort you want to go

234
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,450
looking obviously not by eye but the

235
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,630
clone software you can go to

236
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,640
analyze the histograms the histogram

237
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,660
of the photo is  and characteristic of the photo

238
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,040
ok it can be moved from one side to the

239
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,890
other but in any case it is a band

240
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,980
made in a certain way

241
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,140
there is a process called error

242
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,210
le belle analysis which serves to indicate

243
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,670
whether the photo could be artifact

244
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,660
or not

245
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,730
practically it is a function of  ground for

246
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,100
photos that have

247
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,640
compression algorithms behind the basic concept is

248
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,710
the photo is compressed when he then

249
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,850
made it if it is modified a

250
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,830
recompression occurs no  n only the

251
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,240
original photo but also the modification it

252
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,170
introduces whereby at a certain point there

253
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,930
is a different compression factor

254
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,780
based on the areas of the photo the

255
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,850
modified part will have a certain type of

256
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,300
compression the old part will have a

257
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,670
more uniform factor made in sum

258
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,220
garments for which thank you look at this

259
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,750
process you can highlight a possible

260
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,270
anomaly

261
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,680
same thing with

262
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,420
luminescence ingredients so for example photo

263
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,040
top left

264
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,120
exact exact no jpeg and entertainment and in fact

265
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,940
she applies it mainly jpeg

266
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,320
left original photo right photo

267
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,020
altered in colors and  she contrast the

268
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,460
usual things

269
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,980
at the bottom of the histograms in fact with 5

270
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,280
for which it is not rocket science of the

271
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,130
two photos beyond the tea as done in the

272
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,540
histogram you see that in the one on the

273
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:16,300
right there is a significant anomaly and

274
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,830
this can be seen by eye or simply

275
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,980
or  as I told you an example of

276
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,070
cloned areas a part of the forest a year I repeat

277
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,590
glued on the other side maybe

278
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,480
not double yes  you see a software is smarter than the

279
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,240
eye recognize it the usual

280
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,470
this is done a lot with the backgrounds

281
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,140
the example of the missile from before is an

282
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,810
example they don't take the copy pasted

283
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,959
adapted a little

284
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,070
I'm going to make a comparison of the areas

285
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,640
[Music]

286
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,830
[Applause  ]

287
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,490
those instruments sent in which you are not

288
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,530
selected

289
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,520
[Music]

290
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,800
well then the forensic analysis software

291
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,440
that for images are quite

292
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,540
advanced of the slightly

293
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,820
manipulated areas they realize it is

294
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,420
obvious that if you change it totally they make

295
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,710
a little difficulty but how it still keeps

296
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,970
to hunt the  'goal is to understand

297
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,920
the false image or not you realize it

298
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,760
because re-pasting an eva area on it

299
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,080
alters the properties of the image

300
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,970
so for example, as we said before,

301
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,000
the compression ratio changes but

302
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,310
maybe not if you don't know

303
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,780
what it is  it was done in that area

304
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,040
but if in the race you forget

305
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,710
the image

306
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,300
then obviously there are techniques

307
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:53,830
for those who need go yes or you may

308
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,840
know it works n  and the sense that in that

309
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,080
area there is an anomaly perhaps

310
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,730
perfect contour of the alteration you cannot say it

311
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,920
for example if the photo was taken here of

312
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,120
me but add the bottle here

313
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,069
in front here in the area of the bottle

314
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:14,550
not anomaly you cannot tell if the

315
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,550
whole  bottle is alone it is also the cap or it is

316
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,310
also a piece of t-shirt but you know

317
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:28,489
that almost an anomaly to that yes

318
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,360
in what sense fingerprint

319
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,520


320
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,820
basic way you work on photos ok so

321
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,240
the anomaly that is it is obvious that if you

322
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,000
create images  the movie a little different

323
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,950
because you start with a vector stuff

324
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,690
so not much of this you miss it you

325
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,570
get a svg it makes it rizzi you save it

326
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,490
as jpeg

327
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,140
there is a bit different kind of talk

328
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,370
about the shadows on the lights

329
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,610
i obviously bales is only worth the part

330
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,470
technique that case there you go to get to the

331
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,160
image intended as a file in the case in

332
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,520
fact

333
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,720
you instead produce something and you want to

334
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,920
give the certainty that your

335
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,020
authentic image because you have to sell because

336
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,550
you are afraid that there are old  i

337
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,450
that turn there are techniques to

338
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,920
prove the veracity of the images

339
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,270
these are based on encryption

340
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,000
therefore digital easy signature of the

341
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,130
image for clear signature or

342
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,310
on watermarking watermarking at various

343
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,950
levels can be the stencil with your

344
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,200
name can be ward marks in

345
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,170
inverted commas invisible but

346
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,779
Certainly verifiable

347
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:57,420
curiosity some time ago I thought a

348
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,910
year ago it turned out that many

349
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,070
color laser printers put a markin engine of the printer model in the watermark

350
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,230
on the side of the page

351
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,839


352
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,310
this is a fairly common thing that

353
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,170
I know if you want  try scan a

354
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,020
banknote photocopy them where the photocopy

355
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,800
comes a nice message says boy you

356
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,570
can't use my printer to

357
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:23,790
cheat how to do this stuff because this

358
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,270
is chatter

359
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:29,050
how to do it there are tools there are

360
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,790
commercial tools of the suites very much

361
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,650
complete, however, one of the most

362
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,030
famous in the world an Italian product is

363
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,090
called tea  five and there are also others

364
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,640
there are and there are

365
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,730
even open source tools that make a

366
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:48,590
piece of everything obviously

367
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,810
very nice jpeg because it integrates many many

368
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,270
techniques of those of the mathematical properties of the

369
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,270
image say one thing

370
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,560
more oriented towards metadata phoenix

371
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,940
l  'they did some time ago also

372
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,110
the cute one

373
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,140
try them in short then it depends what

374
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,940
you have to do

375
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,890
the concept is I want to know

376
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,440
about the image fakes or not

377
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,280
I follow a check list many

378
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,800
times I stopped first it's easy to catch it

379
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,540
for fakes like those  that

380
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,500
run on the internet

381
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,230
I hardly really have to go

382
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,230
except in cases of investigation to see

383
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,210
all the properties at a mathematical level of the

384
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,910
image it is important to

385
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,910
always ask questions beyond the technicality st

386
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,920
photo here who took it where did it

387
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,620
why  he asked it when he

388
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,230
asked it simple questions which, however, often

389
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,970
help to clarify the context in which it

390
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,310
is asked, then if obviously he was able to

391
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,590
find  and a second photographer of the

392
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,180
same case I know

393
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,860
in a second hard photo from another

394
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,930
photographer of the kennedy session

395
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,590
obviously what helps and I would say

396
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,980
he played so if there are any questions go

397
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,400
ahead

398
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,440
here

399
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,570
well then transparency in reality this is

400
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,620
a  small check list that I have written

401
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,620
down if you search on the internet

402
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,620
there are several even much more

403
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,140
complete than these made for

404
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,399
journalists in the sense that it is yes how

405
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,649
often to fall into these traps here

406
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:35,019
journalists do it there are

407
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:38,140
people who prepare books  or the

408
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,210
authentication checklists of the

409
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,730
video media of the audio media explained very

410
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,700
simply very clear with all the

411
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,010
evaluation benchmarks to understand if

412
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,929
something will also be false so if anything,

413
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,620
look at those too I take

414
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,380
for example the histogram that has brought

415
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,330
previously let's say the white marks

416
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,340
that were created were for

417
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,019
compression so a lack of data

418
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:05,559
or derived from various algorithms that I am

419
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,210
ignorant  you and magic etcetera etcetera

420
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,299
no from the alteration that of the image and

421
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:14,139
the following reconversion possible there is

422
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:15,519
every program there is its interaction

423
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,130
that is identifiable a certain in a

424
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,549
certain range or it is generic what you

425
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:22,870
see that there is something that  it does not go

426
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,679
in various ways in the sense that for example

427
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,740
this is a normal histogram you could

428
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,840
for example apply other filters to this photo

429
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,510
that make it all

430
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,760
weird type cracked type

431
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,820
sand type and you would see that in certain areas there

432
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,630
is no uniformity like c  'it was original for

433
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,909
which, for better or worse, sharp edges

434
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:47,919
some something you see it what matters

435
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,580
is done you realize it transpires by

436
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,289
superimposing a transparent layer layer

437
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:58,870
for example it would change the histogram

438
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,169
yes because anyway you because I know if you

439
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:04,389
lighten it if you increase it by a factor  of

440
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:06,970
a certain color if you increase contrast and

441
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,190
the histogram can vary it can

442
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,639
move here or there to 0 I change the same photo

443
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:15,490
and add a transparent layer and

444
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,190
save it you see that it is  ta alternating

445
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,769
all then transparency do not you to the

446
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:25,049
tricolor and bring the other thing

447
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:29,139
clear brightness it touches contrast does

448
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:31,570
not touch the rgb factors does not touch them

449
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,929
I tried to touch other things

450
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,779
compression ratios to save it and all

451
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,620
the words properties of the image then

452
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,080
even there of penn it depends on the software

453
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,850
because in reality software should

454
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,200
be so intelligent as to understand

455
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,330
that you do not do anything to this photo here

456
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,399
it should leave it

457
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:56,770
to you so even you do not want to save it in my opinion it

458
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,750
does them in fact they ask you is that they make it

459
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,120
save understood

460
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,720
place

461
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:23,940
one more last to waving more

462
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,700
who in reality is not a question about the

463
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,810
toilet from technical issues but more than

464
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,170
anything else

465
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,540
these techniques in your opinion are used

466
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,150
by journalists frequently then they

467
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,980
also find from that the Greek ones

468
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,770
are aware of the problem if the

469
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,200
problem as how  all the security and

470
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,760
be aware of the problem because

471
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,860
since you know it you adopt techniques

472
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,300
that can be bu  one cannot fail to

473
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,670
be just like you do it when it

474
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,280
does not know the problem but therefore knows

475
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,040
without a belt without an airbag and it is always

476
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,720
better to check the news in the act

477
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,200
even if you know so many the hurry

478
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,230
the anxiety having to publish immediately you

479
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,000
also want to be ignorant of the problem  they do not

480
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,930


481
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,840
put a link on google image

482
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,310
for the search it is a moment it is a

483
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,170
problem of knowledge of culture

484
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,080
we know that the

485
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,909
basic safety culture in Italy is not very high

486
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,090
the stupid question oh well beyond the

487
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,550
safety aspects and  for

488
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,040
the information it can also be useful

489
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,920
from the social aspect they send you a photo

490
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,450
with a house with the stratospheric bicipid and

491
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,950
verify that instead it is another thing

492
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,140
the photoshopped I wanted to understand if you

493
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,140
see them used on a personal level and how you

494
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,750
since you do

495
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:04,090
disappear there  it is then ibc pitt is an

496
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,490
interesting thing because many times when

497
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,110
you make these alterations they

498
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,910
take them from public photos they

499
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,880
stick them on their skimpy arm

500
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,250
and many times already google

501
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,990
smart enough that if the public pasted part

502
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,350
in the photo is big

503
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,620
enough he will find similar photos so

504
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,320
that already many times I just need to know

505
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,790
if I take a picture here anyway a great

506
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,630
dane other so is that the  na li is

507
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,000
very widespread as a photo on the internet

508
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,010
that photo would be enough to recognize the

509
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,560
element and show me the original photo

510
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,660
as similar images in the

511
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:48,340
reverse search is at the percentage level that is

512
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,620
how many times dc from google search

513
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,230
and the first first gorini that therefore

514
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,390
systemic seen cc guarantee a

515
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,980
acceptable solution

516
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,660
that is how many times we have to go

517
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,190
deeper and deeper

518
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,920
depends in itself that in safety the

519
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,560
answer would depend on your 33

520
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,240
model that is why you are doing it

521
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,620
because they sent you the photo here

522
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,780
giant pcpt so it is a whim in which you

523
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,910
invest two minutes  of your time or

524
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,410
why you have to sign an appraisal for a

525
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,510
court

526
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,650
understood it

527
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,660
depends you have to tell me actually note how much you

528
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,100
want  i invest

529
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,880
in analysis because you can go further

530
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,130
that is, you can't find anything on a

531
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,890
reverse search engine you go by steps stop you

532
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,890
the appraisal you have to write it you have to

533
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,850
write it done the consistent i

534
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,559
hope to make me understand these things here

535
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,179
you can for now because they are there  the

536
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:48,990
digital photos

537
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,750
when there were the photos of the past with

538
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,140
many things n were the same that is if you go to

539
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,200
get the experts those old grandparents who

540
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,660
did the appraisals for the courts of the past

541
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,100
who have made the

542
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,250
cases those really serious like that  I

543
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,480
know I show of florence

544
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,570
those things there koolhaas and will launch there is

545
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,120
an analogue photo these were arguing

546
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,610
like this here his photos

547
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:19,530
a logic made of tired of things

548
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,910
photo of lagoon 88 the other when you do

549
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,970
with what there is one  but once there was a

550
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,929
lot more manual skills there was also a lot

551
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,360
more knowledge because now the

552
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,429
professional commercial tools

553
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:37,559
of forensics are really really

554
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,510
very advanced they do a lot a lot of

555
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,720
things but  they do hundreds of check-

556
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,610
ins old man don't give him a hand

557
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,710
those that could be done love the

558
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,350
beauty was that he knew how to be a

559
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,690
dense analyst in fact an analyst uses click

560
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,900
sees good or bad he understands tirana linea

561
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,750
true step instead once they really separate them

562
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,880
do they knew why that

563
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,740
done so why that algorithm is like this

564
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,630
why they have to use it a bit how the

565
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,309
whole world is simplified and becomes more

566
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:10,640
accessible you can do more things

567
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,780
unfortunately to the apple

568
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,290
specialists specialists

569
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,790
are a question according to you on the internet

570
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,200
how much diffusion of these  fake photos

571
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,080
there is around I usually follow

572
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,110
very active and I see that he was

573
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,890
publishing these photos these photos takes a

574
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:42,150
lot of time because you just need to see him every time for

575
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,230
example every time an

576
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,510
attack happens there is always the one who publishes

577
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,110
the photos n attacks before  on twitter I have

578
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,480
suffered there are always there and there

579
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,340
are many and therefore of these cases here

580
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,049
unfortunately also noteworthy there are cases

581
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:58,530
in which you know  i maybe you to get a bit of

582
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,049
retweet you put it on the tweetie and then

583
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:03,390
comes the one who takes it as their real

584
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,910
city with the newspaper account there are

585
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,299
in many cases where fake but old photos were

586
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,059
enough to do that rever search

587
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:13,710
were taken as real  even from

588
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,059
famous newspapers and then contributions

589
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:20,880
it still means one thing for example

590
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,240
very active and is a person with a

591
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,010
group of friends who does this job

592
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,240
here to make the banking of these

593
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,929
fake photos

594
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,659
I know that there are no more questions

595
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,220
thanks  a thousand, however, are around

596
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,909
thanks
