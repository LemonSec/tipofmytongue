1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,600
hello everyone I'm here to talk

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,370
more to give you a quick introduction

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,770
to machine learning what it is and why

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:16,490
it interests us I'm not an expert I

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,869
'm a student I'm studying and as

6
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:21,260
I study collected and why it's because

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,360
hyperlow hear from all  the parts and the

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,520
hype because all in all it is giving

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,270
unexpected results and the idea is very

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,789
very simple we slightly change the

11
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:33,950
paradigm where we are all the

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,859
possible cases during

13
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:39,199
programming and instead we invert we have a

14
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:41,019
generic algorithm to which we give inputs and outputs

15
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:43,489
desired and louis develops the logic

16
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,589
inside in many cases he writes me he

17
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:47,600
writes the logic much better than a

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,300
programmer

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,269
these are some of the cases if we were to

20
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:55,670
ask a programmer to make an

21
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,289
algorithm that transform us preview

22
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,359
a horse the horse na zebra or

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,010
any one  of these examples it would take

24
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,229
days and in any case it would not have a

25
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,530
good result

26
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:08,900
the steps are essentially to

27
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,510
process  the input, whatever the

28
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,900
result, calculate an error and

29
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,900
slightly correct the error with

30
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,820
respect to the desired output and repeat the

31
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,100
procedure as long as the

32
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,710
desired output equals the output we

33
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,810
wanted i.e. the output produced

34
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,260
equals the desired we can give a

35
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,060
very example  very simple with a

36
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,280
mathematical function because at the bottom of

37
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,920
machine learning we will always find

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,880
mathematics as at the bottom of

39
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,090
all computer science on the other hand so if

40
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,590
I only saw the table

41
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,760
on the left

42
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,290
you can see that as an input from

43
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,950
a  dog as output I give you a 9 12 14 17

44
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,660
49 a 91 81 read some time if

45
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,030
you have done a little mathematics

46
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,830
you can assume that both from the root and the

47
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,979
square

48
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:09,860
in a similar way we can have other

49
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,800
other forms other data for which we can

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,890
have  in a slightly more practical example

51
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,569
of online estimates,

52
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:18,950
let's say that your customer asked

53
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,230
for a status by creating a system

54
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,440
that allows him to make estimates.

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,550
mo the size of the house on the one

56
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,620
hand the price on the other it is

57
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,720
actually possible to interpolate a

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,450
mathematical function through these data to

59
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,489
produce an approximation different

60
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,670
mathematical functions will produce

61
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,200
different approximations also have a

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,660
different complexity so in the case on the

63
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,410
left you see a  straight that of course

64
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,940
interpol and let's say that it represents the

65
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,580
data correctly, however a parabola

66
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,739
in fact in this specific case

67
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:55,819
represents much better

68
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:59,870
now how to go to determine what kind

69
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,390
of function or that I hope that here

70
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,350
you are all a little familiar with

71
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,670
what it is  the function of a straight line if

72
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,280
you want I'll explain it quickly you see

73
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,290
in the left case we have a

74
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,970
house that has a value of 7

75
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:21,380
sorry yes 750 of the dimensions of 750

76
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:29,690
the value of 153 opposites in the other

77
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,120
case if we used a

78
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,600
mathematical model in fact a  different parable

79
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,970
we would have an approximation that perhaps goes

80
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,430
more to tread our historian is much

81
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,570
closer to  what our data would tell us

82
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,530
now what you just

83
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,630
saw was given an input found an

84
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,400
output and I'm going to find a model

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,470
now this is the calculation part of the

86
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,000
error I mentioned

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,640
earlier the second of the three steps

88
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,260
if you see these  barrett in and greens that

89
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,190
I have put one on top of the other literally

90
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,680
that you see in the center

91
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,810
you can see how the line actually

92
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,900
produces an approximation that is in

93
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,030
fact worse than the approximation that

94
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,298
a parabola produces I know that it is not a

95
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,100
value that can be appreciated very much

96
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,829
but you can easily see

97
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,990
literally the end bars are

98
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,660
longer if you count one

99
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,060
the error of about 500 which is not

100
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,229
important what is wrong by 500 the other one is

101
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:36,380
wrong by 250 which means that a

102
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,150
parabola in this case for the data that

103
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,040
we have much better next than a

104
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,380
straight line now let's say that this calculation

105
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,710
of the error which is one of the three

106
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,750
Sardinian passages is to select a

107
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,000
possible mathematical model then a

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,290
re  tta rather than a parabola

109
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,290
rather than a polynomial rather than

110
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,870
then I'll show you both to

111
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,919
go and determine what

112
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,340
the inclination is or let's say all the other

113
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,630
parameters that describe

114
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,910
our mathematical function so in the

115
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,030
case of one of a line

116
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,650
we take  the simple example this time

117
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,229
we will have this small and the small

118
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:18,020
b and side by side are two numbers that

119
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,000
actually determine one the

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,759
the inclination of the line is instead the b they

121
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,160
go to identify its

122
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,410
lateral position and therefore they must actually be

123
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,400
interpolated in our time as

124
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,000
let's say that the core the

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,120
interesting part is precisely the algorithm that

126
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,759
slowly given a given error of the

127
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,880
input data goes to adjust our

128
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,550
error until finding the

129
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,030
optimal solution for the chosen mathematical model

130
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,720
repeated this thing can then

131
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,270
allow us to  choose either a

132
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,639
more precise mathematical model

133
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,090
or better parameters or a

134
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,310
more complex mathematical model

135
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,860
maybe always based on a network a

136
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,600
cigarette and one of these

137
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,490
simpler most famous algorithms is called gradient

138
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,060
cent is based on derivatives and in fact they

139
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,050
are going to evaluate the inclination of

140
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,100
what is yours

141
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,120
what you can see on the left

142
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,610
where there is  it is written large cent it is in

143
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,009
fact based on the value of a

144
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,779
in this case I am taking only a as an

145
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,990
example it is the calculated error now I have

146
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,180
tried to put the colors in

147
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,639
correspondence so in the case one where

148
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,889
violet the error will be of what almost 800

149
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:48,379
in case 2 where green will be lower

150
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,110
about 500 and slowly as the

151
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,150
net goes to position itself in the correct position

152
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,349


153
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:56,330
the error and goes down those little bars in the

154
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,479
greens that you have seen before until you

155
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,550
find a solution if it says optimal

156
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:05,930
what you are going to  literally evaluate it

157
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,969
is precisely this

158
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,009
inclination i.e. gradient feels

159
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:13,430
able to understand how much it is improving

160
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,710
so you see precisely the inclination of

161
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,469
this of this curve

162
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:20,360
as the inclination descends  it drops

163
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,580
because it gets closer and closer then

164
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,120
in the front there are more

165
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,819
complex more refined algorithms that in some

166
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,500
cases work better in some cases they

167
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,399
actually work worse

168
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,520
this was true in the case of only a

169
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,060
because in the case of airplanes we no

170
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,680
longer have a simple graph  but it begins to

171
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,389
be two-dimensional now and this is in the

172
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,590
case of a line so we are

173
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,570
working with the two parameters of the

174
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,789
line already it was a parabola we will have more

175
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:00,460
parameters still it is already here when

176
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,509
we pass the second to the third

177
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,259
dimension

178
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:03,389
we are no longer able to visualize

179
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,419
therefore how it is  ago the idea is that for

180
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:09,070
example in the case of the previous houses we

181
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,050
could have the value of the house the

182
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,310
size per year

183
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,960
the area is more than any other let's say

184
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,180
artificial parameters in the sense distance

185
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,520
from the bus stop distance from the

186
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,289
bins of the  garbage or proximity to

187
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:25,449
garbage bins rather

188
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,860
than any other parameter you

189
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,720
can or imagine or have

190
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,280
collected  as a historian,

191
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,960
the result is that in fact we will end up

192
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,839
with n parameters and therefore we will have

193
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:37,630
a mathematical function that has as

194
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,360
input and in the parameters that automatically

195
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,779
becomes not viewable or not even

196
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:48,370
imaginable since there was a lot of

197
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,810
mathematics up to now we have put  the

198
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,779
photo of a kitten but in reality it

199
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,790
should be scared much more than

200
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,010
it does because if we

201
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,260
wanted to use this photo and

202
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,970
then feed our algorithm

203
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,890
in fact this photo

204
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,380
we will have n parameters one per pixel

205
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,240
considering that each pixel in fact

206
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,480
at least in the rgb representation a between

207
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
the red green blue values it means that

208
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,820
we will have many many many parameters and

209
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,470
automatically our

210
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,040
mathematical function that had passed this thing

211
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,959
becomes no longer intelligible for

212
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,279
the human being and therefore how to get

213
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,140
the idea is very much  simple we see

214
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,880
that it works for one

215
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,620
dimension we see that it works for two

216
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,150
dimensions we see that it works homeland dimensions

217
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,560
then you cross your fingers and hopefully it

218
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,820
continues to work for years it has

219
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,400
dimensions but once you understand the

220
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,130
concept then in fact it is just a matter of

221
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,970
scaling it now there are different categories

222
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,260
of algorithms

223
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,750
with this system you can do a

224
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,340
regression or

225
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,590
guess a number that is  I give you the

226
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,030
size of the house then you tell me the

227
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,370
value or vice versa or classification it

228
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,710
will rain based on humidity

229
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,440
or you can do it now in this part it is

230
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,020
about the categories of algorithms that is

231
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,689
what can be done with this system and

232
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,090
forgive me for a second this tour

233
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,860
kerasca thought for an hour

234
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,750
now with 18 minutes it is a little more

235
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,350
complicated the other main category

236
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,150
of algorithms and super vice versus a

237
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,870
supervisor in super eisler we provide

238
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,200
both the solution and the data and

239
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,680
we tell him

240
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,570
these are the data this is correct

241
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,970
this  no or these are the data this is

242
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,340
the value ilan supervisor instead we see

243
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,240
the data

244
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,530
and we expect from the algorithm that it

245
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,020
produces a structure that is able to

246
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,890
aggre  competing data for

247
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,860
similarity relationships that there are among the data to

248
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,720
date most of the examples you

249
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,850
see are supervising now

250
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,130
we live in the case of neuro networks that if

251
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,170
you go to search under wikipedia you will

252
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,180
find it both under super vice learning

253
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,280
kayhan superbike blair because  because for

254
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,200
the most part he is given both the input and

255
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,350
the output but in fact he manages

256
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,720
to create by himself he is able to extrapolate

257
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,770
the data structure

258
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,600
using an algorithm as we said

259
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,580
before I feel so he goes to

260
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,550
model a mathematical model against

261
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,590
your data to get the bus

262
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:31,240
you want now in all the

263
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,250
respectable slides tell you that

264
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,040
the analogy with the

265
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,490
physical neuron is not made because the physical neuron the neuron has in fact

266
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,570
a complexity and characteristics

267
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,200
completely different from the

268
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,180
artificial one  because we say that the

269
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,730
artificial one is a very

270
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,340
very good approximation of the physical

271
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,250
one nevertheless the artificial one thick  o it

272
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,680
is inspired in many respects but at least

273
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,020
the aspects that work years now a

274
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,700
physical and therefore we will continue to

275
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,570
talk about it

276
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,340
also because at an intuitive level for

277
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,140
some things it can be very useful

278
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,780
now what I wanted to show you

279
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,540
before and now I have taken the case of the

280
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,890
of the parabola where I have three parameters

281
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,880
these could be three pixels

282
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,680
rather than the value of the house the

283
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,090
size of the house is the year of the

284
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,390
house and abec which are in fact the

285
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,190
numbers that we want to

286
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,720
find so that our function

287
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,080
produces the desired output that is  the ex

288
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,750
are the inputs the green ones are the outputs the

289
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,450
one in the middle is simply a

290
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,260
sum

291
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,310
and then there is something called

292
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,850
activation function that I have always

293
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,740
been a poor student of mathematics

294
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,930
and the strength to study a herning scene

295
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,650
and I have  discovered that the mathematics in fact

296
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,540
is simply used to fold the numbers

297
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,980
into the shape you like best

298
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,260
so we will choose an active

299
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,360
there is a function  rather than another

300
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,950
and if you go to wikipedia there is an

301
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,880
infinite collection based on what type

302
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,940
of output I want if the numbers it produces

303
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,410
satisfy me or not

304
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,170
now the structure if the one before

305
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,630
sorry this is let's say a

306
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,310
single neuron he can  couple these

307
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,530
neurons once we have this

308
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,690
this basic form that is able

309
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,210
through some algorithms to adapt

310
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,130
to our data we can then go to

311
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,420
hook them and begin to build

312
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,970
networks of neurons which are in fact

313
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,760
chains of mathematical operations with a

314
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,010
network using derivatives

315
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,810
I know that  it's bad to say so but let's

316
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,270
start we can forget for a

317
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,380
moment what is inside

318
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,510
we understand its basic functioning

319
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,390
we are aware that in any case we

320
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,740
will not be able to truly understand

321
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,240
beyond a certain dimensionality in this

322
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,110
dimensionality and 3 and we begin to

323
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,210
take it as a single element and  it can

324
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,910
then be aggregated by actually building

325
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,700
the most diverse networks from

326
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,830
here I have por  given some of these

327
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,310
networks now on the colors the colors here

328
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,899
on the left this legend demonstrates

329
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:17,980
types of neurons which actually means

330
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,699
different mathematical functions and on the

331
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:24,290
right instead you find how these

332
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,259
neurons are actually hooked

333
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:30,470
to each other among let's say the

334
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,360
famous ones  we are definitely enclosed in

335
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,350
neuro to the network

336
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:39,290
long term only and lesti m in the

337
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,899
next you see with volution to the hours to the

338
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:46,160
network or generative opponent neuro

339
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,610
network is the one with which it is generated have you

340
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,890
ever seen generate art there are different

341
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,110
[Music]

342
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,040
let's say that in addition to choosing  the

343
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,509
structure of the single neuron then

344
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:01,970
architecture is chosen and various architectures can be

345
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,279
mixed various forms

346
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,649
of neurons based on this then we are going

347
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:09,470
to create and obtain different effects

348
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,800


349
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,550
each of this architecture each of

350
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,970
these neurons and adapts the processing

351
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,059
of a specific data  not specific, however,

352
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:21,319
let's say that some exploit

353
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:26,600
features such as the neuro al

354
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,420
network fully  connect layer is let's say the

355
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,149
simplest form that had been found

356
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:35,509
and they are simply neurons

357
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:37,339
exactly as I saw them shown then

358
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:39,709
mathematical functions where each input is

359
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,959
connected each output and calculates something

360
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:46,459
unfortunately in this form we

361
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,019
lose a series of information that

362
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:50,509
for  for example, the accounts with con volution to the

363
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:51,999
neuro to the network are instead

364
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:55,149
reserved as for example the space

365
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:58,730
so if we have to pass a

366
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,910
data for which the position of each input

367
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,879
assents in relation to the position

368
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,670
of the other inputs as an image that is

369
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,100
the images do not  it is so clear if

370
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,869
we unfold it completely and make

371
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:15,470
a long line of it where no one is

372
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,509
simply a sequence the images

373
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,249
we are able to interpret them as

374
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:22,040
human beings because because we see them it is

375
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,230
a pixel next to the other it makes sense

376
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,959
with volciano  now network exploits

377
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:27,860
its own

378
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,410
characteristic and preserves the

379
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,350
physical position of i until the end of

380
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,470
processing i  pixels that at the beginning

381
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,209
have neighbors are found close also

382
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:40,670
at the end these in fact give excellent

383
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,730
results for passing the image

384
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,850
another shape and here you can see an

385
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,680
example of neuron era cure and neuro al

386
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,190
network

387
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,140
these are particularly suitable for

388
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,480
everything that  it is sequential

389
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,790
that both music and text everything that is

390
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,800
sequential data that makes sense in a

391
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,529
sequence is useful are passed or

392
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:02,930
give excellent results using a

393
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,970
euro to the network and using the cures and

394
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,669
neuro networks that if you see this

395
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:11,390
green square is in fact a  neuron

396
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,500
like the one we showed

397
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,599
earlier but if you then go and

398
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,520
see what operations it actually carries out it is

399
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,709
definitely more exotic than a simple

400
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:20,419
parabola because because it maintains

401
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,760
internal states that are precisely those

402
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,559
that allow it to develop memory

403
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,700
now these regions will have networks then they

404
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,410
are  hooked to each other

405
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,350
to form chains that allow today

406
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,710
the results are text to spe  ech of

407
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,490
excellent level

408
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,070
are parsing of texts extraction there are

409
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,559
fantastic examples

410
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,270
I will show you some of

411
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,700
the most famous architectures the first

412
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,690
elenet that perhaps

413
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,810
the historian google nor that ada has a

414
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,030
particular characteristic that he manages to

415
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:04,530
learn not only had he

416
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,220
also takes the  architecture then I will talk about it

417
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,620
beyond the rais goals the first one that gave

418
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,540
better results

419
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,640
on image recognition better

420
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,590
than the human being to a human being at 5

421
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,939
percent of the snap makes 3 percent

422
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,290
one last thing unfortunately they are 13 time

423
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,050
limit of which not  I talked

424
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,450
to you the most essential thing perhaps in addition to the

425
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,400
architecture beyond everything

426
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,440
we have talked about is the dataset because

427
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,860
data 7 is what in fact that is

428
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,920
your neuro to the network will never learn

429
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,780
anything beyond what you

430
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,450
taught me the starting data  and I

431
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:42,750
got it

432
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,660
as a note often overlooked is

433
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,650
a slide out of 20 so far it is

434
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,080
vitally important for now and there would be

435
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,080
there are many ways to  r

436
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,560
artificially increase your dataset

437
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,870
I will talk to you anyway let's say that the most

438
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,990
important thing is that it is wide, it is varied

439
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,950
and that it is balanced for what is the

440
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,080
state of the art to date on the development

441
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,400
in Europe network I expected to do 5 they

442
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,710
bring you here find  the references to

443
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,710
many of the images I used

444
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,410
actually come from online courses so

445
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,350
here you have a list of credits and

446
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,120
if you have any questions I am not

447
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,989
available

448
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:45,220
no question is expected

449
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:54,300
here is how that cigarette and let's say the

450
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,640
ability of a neural network to have

451
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,140
memory

452
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,380
let's say  said in terms of a high level

453
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:06,180
that is ok, I am not entirely sure

454
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,890
if I have understood possibly with regimes

455
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,710
as you go you say what it is that

456
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,960
actually goes to learn that is what you have

457
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,520
of the saves that is let's say then I

458
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,400
mean for example we take  we

459
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,360
train our neural network at the beginning

460
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,170
with data or maybe we do even

461
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:36,830
better unsupervised training and

462
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,360
[Music]

463
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:45,000
let's say how we  and I keep the

464
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,580
information inside there is just

465
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,070
I make a comparison courage and the register yes

466
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,650
exact but also at your level

467
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,050
let's say mental that is by making the comparison

468
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,290
then there was the biological what is what then

469
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:05,100
what is it that gives the ability to  save and the

470
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,650
information the teeth yes then I will

471
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,330
show you around the slide for a moment

472
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,530


473
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:15,420
ok here then this is a

474
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,940
very good analogy remember

475
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,320
cannes very good analogy in the

476
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,050
sense that your physical neurons do

477
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,760
fantastic things compared to

478
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,030
these  on a pale imitation but

479
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,490
in the pale imitation you see that on the

480
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,150
left of the black arrows here on the

481
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:38,120
neuron for the famous cult function

482
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,780


483
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,700
these are your inputs that are

484
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,060
equivalent to these ok they would

485
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,860
represent lakes I now have

486
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,900
made a very good attempt to

487
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,430
try representative  of how a

488
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,030
signal

489
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,840
ok you see this little graph here

490
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,380
tells you i don't know x1 at this value here

491
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,050
x2 at this value here x3 at this

492
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,990
v  alue here represents how we

493
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,230
say how strongly this

494
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,410
specific input into neurons is activated the physicists

495
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,150
in reality this does not happen in

496
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,370
only one spike but let's leave it alone

497
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,620
see that they are then multiplied by

498
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,930
those numbers that is here you see that there is a

499
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:27,300
multiplication sign  and then now

500
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,310
the input is the input and it is what you

501
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,350
receive, let's say if it was the

502
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,200
physical brain and what the signal that

503
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,520
comes from the mole gives you from the cones or what

504
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,800
is in short in the retina that a

505
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,650
signal arrives  of a certain type is a certain

506
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,100
activation then that all iva determine

507
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,360
how much this signal is important

508
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,780
or not ok because if it goes to 0 it

509
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,160
means that we have removed that signal

510
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,170
in the sense that it is not important if instead

511
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,700
we put it to one it means that it has

512
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,130
full importance we take a standard

513
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,930
so what you actually go to

514
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,030
learn are precisely the green letters

515
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,800
because because even the only thing that

516
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,200
can actually learn why it was working

517
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,520
that c  'it is below

518
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,470
I tried to trace the cloth with the

519
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,170
same colors where there is x1 red which is

520
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,550
the input then to the abecs which are in green

521
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,840
and then in fact there is nothing else

522
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,440
so abec are in fact called

523
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,740
waits  that is the weights or how

524
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,240
important is these inputs compared to the

525
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,450
others or how important in general

526
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,700
consider that then this is a single

527
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:43,030
unit that is said to be linked to

528
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,160
others, i.e. as a single unit it is able to

529
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,630


530
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,270
express what a polynomial of  third

531
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:49,690
type

532
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,950
then said to make you one

533
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,330
so to the maximum so he manages to say to

534
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,279
represent up to a certain up to a

535
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:02,389
certain point but adding them and perhaps it is

536
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:04,519
precisely the magic of deep learning where

537
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:07,730
every additional layer that is added

538
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:14,899
you go in fact to condense and  as if

539
00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:16,490
there was an exponential growth in the

540
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,049
amount of information that each her and

541
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:19,909
manages to represent with respect to her to the

542
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:20,860
previous one

543
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,559
because if we had to provide why

544
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,500
then what is there  it is this part here ok

545
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,100
that it is in fact this part here where the

546
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,500
result of this neuron

547
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,720
is fed to all subsequent neurons or

548
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,669
part of the subsequent neurons based

549
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:40,090
on the architecture which is what you need

550
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,850
in the next slide that is the neuron

551
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,470
that has us  shown before for example it

552
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,480
could be one of these dots the

553
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,490
lines of these tender lines are its

554
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,980
connections with the connections there are in

555
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,889
fact new neurons and this is the

556
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:57,010
black net this for example

557
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:01,070
represents the a of this neuron here

558
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,110
that is, let's take this as an example  I

559
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,700
would like it here this is water and therapies

560
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,919
this is china so they go to

561
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:08,929
build these chains and slowly

562
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:11,029
build a mathematical model

563
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:14,360
that as a rhythm and generic needle but you in

564
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,429
fact go to save for each layer for

565
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:21,320
each neuron the various  waits the weights of each

566
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,130
connection to the previous neuron

567
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,480
I answered the question

568
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,420
in fact saves the matricides numbers

569
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,120
what then in fact has in hand that is how

570
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,060
intelligible  then ok I understood the

571
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:43,920
discourse that we say no not to the data then

572
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,380
there are techniques to visualize

573
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,540
but for some things they always work

574
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,760
for with euro volution to the network there are

575
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,470
quite advanced techniques to

576
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,600
go and visualize what in

577
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,330
fact your network has learned for  what

578
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,390
I know the initial premise I know very

579
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,330
little for example to include at least

580
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,640
the network it is much more difficult I have

581
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,960
seen some examples of parsing of

582
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,230
texts difficult to understand what it is that you have

583
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,640
actually learned that is for some

584
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,230
neurons you realize that I do not know they are

585
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,730
activated  every time there is a comma

586
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,800
in paris that is because they learned

587
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,250
where to put them videos for others they go to

588
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:25,670
extract structures from the data that

589
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,230
maybe they do not go to abstract the data how

590
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,330
to attract them dressed because in fact they do not

591
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,920
have the same information a

592
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,560
whole year  the linguistic background and therefore

593
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,790
maybe they find simpler structures

594
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,040
or that because they don't

595
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,990
actually make sense ok ha lan  once

596
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,940
what is saved are matrices of

597
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,690
numbers plus the architecture if appropriate but

598
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,130
actually that, that is, if

599
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,440
the architecture remains fixed, there are few

600
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,970
numbers that you go to insert into the

601
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:59,870
equations yes

602
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:05,730
I ask a trivial question

603
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,739
because I heard it more  times

604
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:10,309
passion the first time I get

605
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:13,409
dressed and understand a little more I don't know but

606
00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:14,539
the explanation

607
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:18,720
I wanted to tell you the speech of the abec in

608
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,419
kuwait and he said that based on the three

609
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,659
inputs it is we who are going to give

610
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,419
more weight based on what  we

611
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:31,470
want the network to be unequal and to give

612
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,220
more weight just to better understand it is

613
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,779
as if we were going if we had

614
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:41,749
projects to which we prioritize for

615
00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:46,279
this he in a barrel gender be more

616
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:52,580
understood I am now looking

617
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,549
to later I think that the white background

618
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,470
that were created at a certain point if

619
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:03,470
white and red sound out no louder

620
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,049
confusion and c7 that you speak of interest

621
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:07,640
what you are talking about then to

622
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,080
ciniero a higher number because it

623
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,299
interests  knows that the neuron gives the most weight to

624
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:18,700
what you say and vice-versa of the others so

625
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,899
it is not so it seemed especially but

626
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:28,130
right because then in fact

627
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,649
in principle yes in the end I give relevance

628
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:32,690
to what is more important but we must

629
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,220
do even if there  there are cases that

630
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,409
make you smile about what

631
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:41,059
some neuro networks have actually learned

632
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:43,580
there are some cases that you hear in

633
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,100
history for which for example they wanted to make

634
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,130
a euro to the network that distinguished between

635
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,889
cars and trucks and sent

636
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:54,409
someone out to take pictures of the

637
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:58,220
cars and trucks ok then they

638
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,570
did the dog in this blessed mole

639
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,389
from the network who tried it and

640
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:04,580
learned how it worked then they

641
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,340
actually went out to try zero results

642
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,590


643
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,360
what is but what is but what is proof changes

644
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,840
architecture to  in the end it turned out

645
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,720
that called out to take pictures he

646
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,029
took pictures of the cars in the morning

647
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:22,070
with some light he took pictures of the

648
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,409
trucks in the afternoon that it was much

649
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:25,940
darker and in fact  what I learned

650
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,490
at the neo from the network was when it's clear it's

651
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,230
a car and when it's dark it's a truck

652
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,919
15

653
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:46,820
no then when you know at some

654
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,290
point the last few months a slide where we

655
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,020
talked about the dataset now what you do

656
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,200
n't see very well here  below there is a

657
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,600
technique called dataset arguments

658
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,700
for which you take your photos for

659
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,710
example of the truck and cars

660
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,220
and change the brightness randomly

661
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,530
then take the photos and of the same

662
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,080
photo you make 10 copies at

663
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,410
random brightness because why  so you avoid that

664
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,210
now network minds relying on the

665
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,280
brightness of the photo to stand out is

666
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,680
a car or not in the same way

667
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,330
then change the rotation slightly

668
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,110
or here are some examples where

669
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,390
I do not know some parts are closed in

670
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,790
this case here was to determine the angle

671
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:33,230
of  this is a driving simulator the

672
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,060
car which had to determine

673
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,590
what the steering angle was in this

674
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,180
case there are occlusions because

675
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,850
because there is always a tree  there is another

676
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,730
machine for the human being it is however

677
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,170
serious to determine that in this case

678
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,020
the right rite must go because because

679
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,810
you actually go based on very little of

680
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,290
this information and therefore you should

681
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,580
be able to do it also in this

682
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,500
case  here the right human being able to

683
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,150
do it here also here also here

684
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,800
also here also understands that I am always the

685
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,900
same case so you in fact go and

686
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,940
mess with the images if you allow me the

687
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,160
term and you tell him look these are

688
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,080
always the same case for which he

689
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,480
begins to create mathematical models

690
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,760
a little more refined not only based on

691
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,010
for example the brightness or in this

692
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,190
case on the fact that blue sky could

693
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,620
be that all the photos that must be said

694
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,900
I don't know the tree-lined avenues this are nets

695
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,280
have all the trees and therefore

696
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,740
above all evergreen unfortunately he

697
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,020
could also learn that and for

698
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,600
what it is the dataset is extremely

699
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,820
important because it is what he

700
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,220
will learn about absurdly if you

701
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,630
m  if you have a green corner a

702
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,450
yellow corner and a

703
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,940
blue corner on your between the categories machines and

704
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,760
motorcycles is that you could easily learn it

705
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,680
is only that corner there to

706
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,720
distinguish understood because that is

707
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,040
what actually maximizes the

708
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,290
potentially so returning for

709
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,680
example to before now in  a

710
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,280
very simplified version let's say this

711
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,260
here is what he sees that let

712
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,540
's say the top left corner is this

713
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,460
here is the rest of the image these here

714
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,220
sets them to zero and distinguishes only on

715
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,290
this because because that is what is

716
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:23,010
maximizing the function  precisely that

717
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,200
is certainly true, that is, on the other side

718
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,180
you are asked it does not require you to

719
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,860
write software somewhere

720
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:39,000
you want to bang people of earnings

721
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,040
even the loaf again because who knows

722
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,670
maybe tomorrow not some other

723
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,820
questions

724
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,900
I understand

725
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:03,140
but if by chance I thank you  for

726
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,640
patience this is the second time they

727
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,480
gave this topic

728
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,760
sorry if there are any inaccuracies

729
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,520
please and if  by chance you have other

730
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,530
questions comes to your mind later with a found

731
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,250
not even around you ask it

732
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:22,940
anyway just right so that is why

733
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,070
I asked you in the questions is a small

734
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,360
neuro to the network written in what ras that

735
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,010
represents the net this small

736
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,070
implementation that is perhaps  the first a

737
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,810
first example of neuro to the network

738
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,100
was the first example of neuro to the network

739
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,620
working as you can see code if in the

740
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,560
postscript it is really very little

741
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,080
here is that the dataset at least must be taken

742
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:50,620
care of and with this he concludes
