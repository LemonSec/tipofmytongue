1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,770
i'm fabio carletti i come from the

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,200
marches macerata i also heard it from i

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,630
turn on i'm here to give two talks the

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,018
first on pyol and the second on debian gnu

5
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:17,250
jerez sec

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,560
so this will be a mind plus a

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,019
popular talk for a sort of advertising

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,589
in short for the project  pyol the second

9
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:31,470
deals with the themes of the app awards

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,590
linux and therefore things a little more complex

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,080
will be a pause of a few minutes between the

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:44,010
first second talk then this

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,590
disclosure began that I wanted to propose for

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,870
how to remove from the east which is the

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,990
pyol project and I present bayonne  starts from the

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:57,720
assumption that the various advertisements the

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,180
various buttons and social media all those

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,280
devilry that if they sell now

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,020
to track us and in any case spam

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,179
advertising on our invalid web pages

21
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:14,490
this project has been created which is

22
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,549
called pyol pyol not many now read

23
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,189
paino is recalled to barry  by no

24
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,100
because I'm recalling the pai

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,979
in reality paiole non adoc is a project

26
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,639
that was created to run on a

27
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:37,020
raspberry because it starts  ially

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,240
a raspberry was taken but then as we will see

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,009
it is not that one must necessarily but rosebery it is

30
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,799
enough that a nice linux will go and

31
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,009
do some sort of install ds

32
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,820
tea services for which it will limit

33
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,190
the display of advertising or

34
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,710
that I do not know if you have this  on youtube

35
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,840
that are those seconds to wait here it

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,200
removes all this rubbish that

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,680
contaminates the web page and creates more

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,020
data traffic to normal viewing

39
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,160
as I said are brands in

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,370
computer security and low with the

41
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,959
open source environment by now since 98 or

42
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,320
starting at university like Jul

43
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,980
then  then I married the open

44
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,350
source philosophy of the iso hand I don't wonder

45
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,190
detached then these are

46
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,489
references of the project facebook page

47
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:40,140
reddit forum then this pyol project

48
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,390
does nothing but go and install a

49
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,250
sort of dns server then they will also be

50
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,870
screenshots of the

51
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,709
installation process  but it is a bland very

52
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,580
simple thing in short, it is not that you need to

53
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,600
have who knows what skills

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,890
in short for  install this project

55
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,560
I don't know if anyone remembers the

56
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,200
bash hathaway script that is downloadable

57
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,830
by people basha dawei was a kind of

58
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,140
a project that was installed on

59
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,840
the linux system and went to block

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,140
advertisements then on a host file already

61
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,390
upstream i  domains at ip level then pyol

62
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,440
oe basha da wade just mentioned it's not

63
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,150
like third party plugins adblock

64
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,680
block curly block I don't have much

65
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,830
use now on firefox chrome that

66
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,150
once the page is loaded

67
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,460
all that advertising that will be a

68
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,520
sort of black list for  these addresses

69
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,940
the advertising of the page is not displayed

70
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,250
rarely here instead the speech

71
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,709
is different it goes to block

72
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,610
directly upstream them through the

73
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:59,170
dns lists since these advertising in

74
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,709
which it goes to limit just that there is

75
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,690
only like the first page  landfill and then

76
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,780
does not show them because there is the udc bloc or

77
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,209
the marker that goes to avoid the envelope

78
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,610
but just hammond and is

79
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,190
not unloaded at all, that is, if it can be  bblicity

80
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,810
comes from here the address of the batteries to

81
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,798
that domain

82
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,950
is blocked to the world and therefore in

83
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,660
addition to speeding up navigation but it

84
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,720
is also a saving in

85
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,260
data traffic in the bank we will see who for those of you

86
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,470
already paraded know very well

87
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,760
that once  an album close with

88
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,080
pyol installed just need to point dns to

89
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,830
this system and it already goes to avoid

90
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,210
advertising but also on a mobile phone

91
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,860
because they are lan networks

92
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,310
so you avoid

93
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,250
waste of data traffic then whoever wants to

94
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,040
can open on the internet does it is

95
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
their own  vpn would be where

96
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,410
all the devices go, even outside the

97
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,100
home, points them to this system and therefore

98
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,220
traffic the tia will benefit from it because it

99
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,690
consumes less traffic

100
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,500
then this product here is

101
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,880
a project that

102
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,660
was initially indicated for

103
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,270
smart TV for mobile browsers and

104
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,180
for in  both home and

105
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,440
corporate mag because

106
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,100
it allows us to choose which then afterwards

107
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,010
I will show screenshots

108
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:46,710
of dns screenshots in which the system goes to download  yes

109
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,870
of the lists that are part of the

110
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,380
advertisements but in turn we are logos

111
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,100
jam long waves to which dns to

112
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,350
refer I spoke recently with a former

113
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,110
employee of the cisco and he told me

114
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,440
for those who do not know that our open is

115
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,690
currently the only protection  that there is

116
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,420
locker refusal for windows systems

117
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,720
because cisco I do not know if you want to know that

118
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,750
he bought I have well dna always there 208

119
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,420
67 220 222 208 67 point 220 using 20

120
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,570
cisco I don't go which is monitoring and having

121
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,160
memorizing let's say the domains and

122
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,830
addresses where the locker kit goes to

123
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,470
download the program which then

124
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,370
encrypts the files with ms open live

125
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,350
blocking a world a bit like it is paired

126
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,110
with advertisements so currently

127
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,250
if one is already windows

128
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,010
the only protection unless we would be  a

129
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,620
more careful with the attachments of the emails

130
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,500
then firmly is pyol is nothing more than

131
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,440
a platform project that is

132
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,870
subtly there were of a command on

133
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,310
chip that is used in the

134
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,180
linux environment and I present

135
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,440
cyber security  so we do

136
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,280
consultancy different companies

137
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,830
the computer they use for firewall

138
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,920
computers that use for nas

139
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,510
stalled also pyol and practice killing two

140
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,950
birds with one stone also because

141
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,590
words allows me through a

142
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:36,020
web server already to see the statistics

143
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:42,290
of the advertisements of all this  which is

144
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,240
blocked and also allows me to

145
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,490
create white lists and

146
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,030
black lists counting keys to

147
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,150
update this is a really

148
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,250
simple thing always simple no need

149
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,190
for who knows what skills is a command to

150
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,130
eat if you manage to plan already only

151
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,250
having that dns  go to point there is the

152
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,470
possibility of issuing custom dns

153
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,630
so we choose ens that we

154
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,940
like them more and once

155
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,680
the action is finished if there are no problems just

156
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,610
abound the router bn dns as davis

157
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,080
omit the address of the machine in

158
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,060
which we have  talked about bayonne so it is not

159
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,099
that there is a need for who knows what

160
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:24,830
knowledge in short here is this is the

161
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,669
famous command that I told you curl

162
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,669
s  octop it for those who use ubuntu

163
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:36,679
otherwise dagan is on in practice it goes to

164
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,029
stall this cauldron net low

165
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:45,380
the installation is very simple

166
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,459
then I will tell you a few numbers

167
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:54,620
then pyoor yes yes come in via a

168
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,709
volunteer burner where wisely

169
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,920
everything started for the talk of

170
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,990
advertising that  in addition to gas in the area he will

171
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,360
kiss and therefore also annoy but the

172
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,040
problem is also a problem of privacy

173
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,529
because the advertisements I do not know if you

174
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:14,089
were 2 years ago here in les that there was

175
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:19,089
a talk in which the guy said just

176
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:24,529
how much the advertisements  they monitored what

177
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:25,190
we do

178
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,209
but it is absurd because it is not that

179
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:31,490
the advertising of I do an example

180
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,720
google so ad sense note things

181
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,600
google knows that I am seeing that page

182
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,000
there no there are banks shines in which

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,339
what I am seeing what I am

184
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,620
doing knows  34 companies advertising

185
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,180
the revered information I love very much

186
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,640
a way around and therefore beyond that is

187
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,510
a speech of advertising

188
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,170
to lighten the basis of speeding up

189
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,700
the  navigation but it is a matter of

190
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,280
privacy because all the buttons all the

191
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,060
advertisements

192
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,310
in practice give all the information of

193
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,500
our session holes what we are

194
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,600
viewing our password

195
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,200
we are logged in on other social networks to

196
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,190
suppliers of the parties in which we may not

197
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,900
believe that he said this

198
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,270
information

199
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,840
as  you know what things are most

200
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,350
senz and speeds up a lot from surfing the

201
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,100
internet there are also some

202
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,050
we can use the data that we

203
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,000
go to

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,480
[Music]

205
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,100
to create with the use of pyol and then

206
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,470
we can use it for scripts or

207
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,769
interfaces that serve  in short for other

208
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:55,939
things so they are available to the

209
00:10:55,939 --> 00:11:00,680
bees these are the domains that is

210
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,980
currently blocking so it is a

211
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,009
project that are evolving but it has

212
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:11,870
many many lists of services that give

213
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,850
advertising so it works

214
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,860
really great

215
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,589
and this was a screenshot

216
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,000
of the  installation an example

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,850
initially there was only google and some

218
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,509
other dns adds I have ben bns and then all  at the

219
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:28,639
end it was also put the case he

220
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,259
can add the dns manually

221
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,389
usually from the latest statistics also

222
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:40,819
of the bayonne most

223
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:43,790
people are starting to

224
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,509
like yandex a lot from those who do not recognize they are

225
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:51,139
russian they are russian dns and the address is 77

226
00:11:51,139 --> 00:12:00,949
88  83 77 88 84 and it is a sort of I

227
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:03,319
tell you so right for as if it were of

228
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:06,050
opendns only that the Russians

229
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,350
then there is the basic version and the

230
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,500
version with that blocks malware and both

231
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,319
the family version for giamo borno and

232
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:19,009
such things  it is called yandex bella

233
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:21,160


234
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,520
then another thing to say

235
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,590
here is the screen that you can see

236
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,880
for more as I said before in addition to

237
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,770
dns server and also stalls one

238
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,080
on the web software where I can

239
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,490
go to see the statistics of

240
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,170
what has blocked things has not blocked

241
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,880
traffic it is possible there is also the

242
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,860
command to update the lists to

243
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,560
block advertisements and also create

244
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,630
black lists

245
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,580
lately many companies are

246
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:00,500
putting this pyol s  u vps of amazon

247
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:07,460
so that they aim big and avs to the

248
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,030
company ps they know that they have blocked

249
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,980
there is a good reference also on the

250
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,340
internet even for promoters who

251
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,390
go around but for the course advertising more

252
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,560
clear who goes around and  do

253
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,430
dark representative de rita pictured

254
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,760
here we are talking about a

255
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,220
significant saving in the data traffic area

256
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,940
[Music]

257
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,770
there is a shock available to

258
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,350
contribute solid t-shirts with the

259
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,760
cup and the sweatshirt is a project in short

260
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,250
that both supports it but why

261
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,060
most  volunteers

262
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:55,370
this is the seat not well the hood

263
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,380
this girl who have

264
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,330
recently taken the image of

265
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,440
the image of the admits short sleeves and

266
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,320
another thing to add is that you go

267
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,830
all

268
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:17,010
and born as I said was born for already a  to

269
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,050
use raspberry in the home environment

270
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,880
to give it an

271
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,850
interesting use then it has extended and found

272
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,769
the support damage and therefore the

273
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,829
initially there was no

274
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,660
web server speech for the statistics it was

275
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,250
One thing that arrived later

276
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,380
at the beginning was just a simple script

277
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,440
in which nava created a san marco dns server

278
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,890
and therefore my invitation and my

279
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,310
interest was to divulge or inform

280
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,570
for those who do not know this

281
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,190
project that for those who work as a

282
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,990
system administrator it could be  an

283
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,250
interesting way for a

284
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,540
programmer so that those who go on the

285
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,540
internet surely find themselves much

286
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,270
less under than what they

287
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,260
could take for a negation

288
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:19,860
whatever I have finished my talk thanks

289
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,040
for the attention

290
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,350
some questions some curiosity if

291
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:34,830
I can answer please for the strong

292
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,180
were  tabor gassman and I repeat that there is

293
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,860
a microphone of a thousand list who is it that

294
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:57,570
generates me to one is the bayonne project that

295
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,000
during the ancient command

296
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,190
they curve that is able to download

297
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,400
absolutely a bag that is enough for the

298
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,640
elites then  give it to avoid and decide

299
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,550
what which lists and is part of a

300
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,240
worldwide thematic project there is now

301
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,730
talking about cigar when and there is the

302
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,400
vision block  adblock and list is the one

303
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,400
when already from sandro sends to par to

304
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,910
avoid advertising so you can also

305
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,000
give it and add them already programmed

306
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,800
while when all black list is that

307
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,330
on the web interface

308
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,000
among the options then add you too

309
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,650
some rob company sites which facebook no

310
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,480
ai  my employees when it

311
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,709
also admits things that block the

312
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:51,120
dns level of the sites to be browsed

313
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,140
while looking at the command can also download

314
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,510
with buvette and you can see

315
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,089
anything that is already written some all

316
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:01,630
open source so

317
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,760
there is nothing of the  scooter and hidden

318
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,599
in short and then putting some dns that

319
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,130
maybe also knows some that filters

320
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,720
big would like more you can have an

321
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,390
additional level in short, blocking

322
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:31,120
indeed it is always dna it is the door on a

323
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:38,130
tiguan dns server I invite you to try it out

324
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,170
of a stupid bomber that  the green paper

325
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,870
test put dagan a linux and what he

326
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,590
wants in short launch of the command the

327
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,050
wizard that the absolute dns

328
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,240
little more in short to the f  ine you are on

329
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,070
dns server that you can point it

330
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,590
inside your home company

331
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,930
what is already you I find in short that a

332
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,800
buy on youtube

333
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,650
go around and never on porn sites go to

334
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,260
download legal robben john a lot

335
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:13,480
but I had mentioned before  having

336
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,740
mentioned the low hathaway project

337
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,020
I don't know if he knew them is that it was a

338
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,550
project for linux

339
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,800
in short, it goes to the host level to block

340
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,060
ip address that is it is not that it was

341
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,040
invented who knows that in short it is only a

342
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,220
useful thing to authorize ramid open source

343
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,640
which uses linux and to improve

344
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,020
navigation

345
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,660
so nothing more than going to stop at

346
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,690
the ip level and it is hammond domain and before

347
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,210
he enters the house and loads it the

348
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,740
page where joe wants more for this

349
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,680
advertisement is and it is not that I find the

350
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,930
box  empty it does not exist it is blocked

351
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,450
upstream so in addition to speeding up

352
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,140
data traffic

353
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:02,830
there is also less data to download and if we

354
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,480
have it I saw it windows or in the

355
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,430
business environment it is convenient to biamino away so the

356
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,960
waves  adds the fact of privacy

357
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,800
a fact now monitored interested

358
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,260
because it is enough that with less advertising

359
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,770
fast however in short it was to kill more

360
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,090
birds with one stone in short as they

361
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,340
say paid question

362
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:39,020
ok about me says lambrate my staff has not

363
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,040
only the avalanche a saul of cd that

364
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,020
this thing mainly thought to

365
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,179
be installed for example on barry in the

366
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:49,309
house initially yes because the call

367
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:51,290
piper piper trees that is right must

368
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,630
use we use it as a server 9

369
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,330
music so now we put it there but in

370
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,910
reality it is nothing more than that command

371
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:07,130
that this l  'area on giordaniello maze

372
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,010
arm architecture on for example for

373
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,200
the most part I can go wherever you

374
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,330
want so that they speak maybe first

375
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:24,710
go directly as possible but

376
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:29,380
you should rudar fix it to the series

377
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,610
under purpose was to restore the

378
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,320
home audio and you should put the

379
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,360
computer there that maybe also uses

380
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,280
for March I had other things or that makes us

381
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,400
do all the casa larghi que  he is here he

382
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,840
reports and it is already the day in

383
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,280
caserta a riccio then points as dns is

384
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,240
one more thing the go adds the

385
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,240
classic ms service that you can put it as an

386
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,679
alternative to raising him

387
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:57,410
in the end I am only going to point to one of the

388
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,420
dns  main ones that have been chosen

389
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,470
on the installation then google

390
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,169
Russian eagles or sell being or

391
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:10,150
genetic gastone and then reach

392
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:15,780
precisely yes but can not do it and the screenshot

393
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,810
but

394
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:24,040
look here I do not know if you read it is written

395
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,870
white list and black list

396
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,850
by clicking here already classic  spaces in which

397
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,760
bond add facebook because two

398
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,370
pendants you want that do not go and there was

399
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,320
sure we are indeed

400
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,180
local imported images that is which black

401
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,340
yes yes yes yes if you wanted to add yes

402
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,500
because this is one thing was in your

403
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,050
computer at your home it is not a

404
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:45,710


405
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,900
cloud speech yes no I said if one wanted to

406
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,240
go in the summer you can contribute to

407
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,800
this thing here perhaps by reporting

408
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,370
domains that

409
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:58,510
are minutes for the company I invite you to

410
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,090
go n  at the basis of the project and I had

411
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,790
put the indication at the beginning here it is

412
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,780
here they kiss it facebook and deliver

413
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,940
it you will find them on the risk site

414
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,090
between the slides to download so here is

415
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,070
reference in these here

416
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,170
go to the forum income part there is also their

417
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,380
own site  you find everything in short yes

418
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,010
wanting wars also has to advise but

419
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,020
the things to be blocked

420
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,160
or you can stay then there is a lot of

421
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,070
young soo git so how to do even

422
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,570
tomic of the junta must something in short

423
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:45,370
being here all open source it is good

424
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,960
humanitarian time or anyone can

425
00:22:46,960 --> 00:23:00,910
contribute  at 3 I do not see hands 3 to those who

426
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,390
lie the program gets in the middle

427
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,920
I see that it has shown that you can

428
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,570
add something by giving away click

429
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,270
in that part here and I can make

430
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,200
any list and csc I pass a sheet a

431
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,050
file that is also  on the internet

432
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,820
direct auto leads he goes to read it

433
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,840
takes down a list of things to

434
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,870
block

435
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:26,140
if you want yes but I never did it

436
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,260
because the domains that they add

437
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,140
as a project are  or very tested and

438
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,549
oh well I am it is understood on cd mp3

439
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:40,049
blocking things

440
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:42,840
the mental stems because I know that the sanga

441
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,520
the block near these

442
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,500
additional plugins which are also

443
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,110
experimental sections already walls are these here

444
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,140
but usually as cool more

445
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,400
tested stuff than because

446
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,910
on the fair fox what usually when you

447
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,970
add these here and maps you feel a

448
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,830
lot of the browsers that here in reality

449
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,950
we have dedicated however that it has

450
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,520
resources it is in good shape it only

451
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,630
does that there is no problem but usually in short

452
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,020
just how it is  very active

453
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,930
so I trust what they do

454
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,940
I await their updates I just go to

455
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,250
touch the white list black list if I

456
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,710
have to do something specific better

457
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,620
where this thing here is not but because it is

458
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,650
a private business or domestic thing

459
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:43,710
in short also because you could you could

460
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,860
even if in addition to the project you could

461
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,380
also go edit host files and

462
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,570
block those domains that will tend to

463
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,330
know as an alternative let's say again
