00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,319
hello everyone i am giovanni battista

2
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:09,460
gallus one of the other parts of array

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,589
law firm of which

4
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:14,079
carlo piano is part alberto piano francesco

5
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:18,640
paolo micozzi and simona liprandi many of

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,610
you know us already know us

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,370
i have been dealing with issues related to

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,890
IT law for more  of

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,440
twenty years alas I could not say I

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,270
had hair when I started because it

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,439
would be a lie it

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,339
would be a lie but

13
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:37,960
for some time now I have

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,250
been dealing with trojans for investigative uses of

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,050
cyber hunters to use

16
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,729
the euphemism that has taken hold in  for

17
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:51,219
some time now what

18
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:56,019
I will talk about we will talk about the blackmailers

19
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:58,689
of the side effects of the

20
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,909
zero day collection I will tell you about a framework

21
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:03,010
of the European union that was

22
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,409
published in April of this year and

23
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:09,429
finally some hints on the law edging

24
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:13,240
the law  103 of 2007 that 2017 which

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,970
reforms the criminal code code of

26
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,810
criminal procedure and a paragraph or rather a

27
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,009
paragraph that regulates its own

28
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,140
expressly introduces the cac  IT ciators

29
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,119
in our criminal law trial

30
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:30,520
so it seems appropriate to

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,229
talk about it and it is important to talk about

32
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:34,600
it here I have already talked about it to privacy

33
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,830
I have talked about it in various international conferences it

34
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,470
is very important very

35
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,259
important to talk about it also because

36
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,410
I am not talking about it from today  I cite

37
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,750
myself in 2008 I my colleague francesco paolo

38
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,989
micozzi ae privacy we talked about

39
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:52,599
IT chapters following a

40
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,519
very important sentence the German constitutional court

41
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:57,729
that had created or the right

42
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,369
to confidentiality and integrity of

43
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:01,720
its IT and telematic systems

44
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,560
by deleting some rules that

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,408
allowed  precisely the use of

46
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:10,949
hunters at the end of for

47
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,720
investigative purposes we go a long way in

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,390
time last year I happened to

49
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,650
talk about it at another

50
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,519
international conference and I pointed out the unpleasant

51
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,120
thing that states enjoy

52
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,239
accumulating zero days and this could

53
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,319
create some  problemino there you tell me

54
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,720
if I made a pre  vision is easy

55
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,110
easy I brought bad luck shortly after uan

56
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,750
akrai the accumulation of 0 3 by the

57
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,950
states has exploded spectacularly thanks

58
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,530
to what you all know

59
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,560
and here there is certainly no need

60
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,160
to explain it certainly is why so

61
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,150
important to talk about this  because they are

62
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,310
used heavily for

63
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,920
investigative purposes I do not speak of the intelligence sector I speak of the investigation

64
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,380


65
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,489
therefore of the criminal process and so much so

66
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,830
that a hugh policy framework was published a

67
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,640
short time ago I said in

68
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,019
April 2017 the Italian part is also made

69
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:22,000
by professor  giovanni ziccardi with whom

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,030
the university of milan collaborates and it is

71
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,640
a very interesting reading gives the

72
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,860
picture of the use of

73
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,050
trojan hunters for investigative purposes

74
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,319
at a European level and what

75
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:38,590
this policy framework says divides

76
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,530
the policy proposals for the

77
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,510
fundamental rights and privacy and

78
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,280
on the other the proposals for the impact

79
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,280
of the use of hunters on safety

80
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,959
in general  and of the network and here

81
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,480
I summarize what it says because time is short and

82
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,640
I want to talk above all about the future

83
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,310
discipline Italian disciplines

84
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,739
this framework tells me that

85
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:05,769
first of all it is necessary to make a

86
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,410
privacy impact assessment

87
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,570
before introducing these tools tools

88
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,120
you will tell me that it is clear that tools

89
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,489
so invasive and difficult that they are

90
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,010
somehow compatible with

91
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,970
confidentiality,

92
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,910
a precise and clear legal basis

93
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,550
is needed and this is very important

94
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,830
it is necessary to evaluate and check

95
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,060
what the effects are

96
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,300
and then it is necessary to train the operators

97
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,600
even it is proposed to make

98
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,150
a book a  sort of netbook a manual

99
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,430
of the good hunter or good

100
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,490
hunter operators to use

101
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,470
these systems is a very important fact it

102
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,800
is also necessary that there is

103
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,650
information not only of the operators but

104
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,830
also of the judicial power of the judges

105
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,240
of the prosecutors and of the judges

106
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,340
because why it happens

107
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,850
and that the judges not only the cassation

108
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,520
but a  even the judges and prosecutors

109
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,230
who have to use these systems

110
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,880
order the use of these systems

111
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,940
have no idea exactly how they

112
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,070
work they obviously tell him well

113
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,500
we can intercept dude we can

114
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,810
give a damn about the encryption wow that's cool let's

115
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,290
use the rest there are no big

116
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,690
problems they don't understand which ones  they very

117
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,000
often do not understand what are

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,570
the implications in terms of invasiveness of the

119
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,270
use of these systems on the

120
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,130
devices perhaps of people even unrelated

121
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,970
to the crime as often, as often happens,

122
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,060
among other things, the important part of

123
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,639
this policy framework is also the fact

124
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,830
that the impact on security is not limited

125
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,110
to, let's say, on the protection

126
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,090
of personal data but also on

127
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,820
network security,

128
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,979
therefore the fact that the use of these

129
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,520
systems can impact on the

130
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,340
general security of the IT environment,

131
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,700
therefore first of all in this policy

132
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,250
framework clearly written the

133
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,310
strong encryption is not touched cannot

134
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,500
be touched not  backdoors can be

135
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,280
inserted therefore two

136
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,370
important points that is

137
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,440
the use of trojans for investigative purposes is legitimized in quotes

138
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,660
but attention is said

139
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,570
however strong cryptography is not

140
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,750
touched lennon and no state can

141
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,460
impose backdoors for the devices

142
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,539
and so on

143
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:39,360
and between  the other also land look should

144
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,000
also contain the

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,870
explaining what are the risks that the use

146
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,450
of these techniques give to safety

147
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,590
in general and among other things also

148
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,120
encourage the debate then talk

149
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,230
about this because if you also those who are in the

150
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,840
sector or above all  asks the sector

151
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,150
knows that in pink they have not been used

152
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,820
since the mid-2000s

153
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,280
but if they really started talking about them in Italy

154
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,240
only in 2015 or at least the

155
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,720
news was made by bisignani lawsuit

156
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,330
in the early years 2011

157
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,300
2012 but before they were massively

158
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,820
used  for investigations of

159
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,340
organized purposes in particular but under

160
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,990
trace without any discussion here is the

161
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,640
European framework says no bisog  n

162
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,980
talk about them because they are

163
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,350
particularly invasive tools so you have to

164
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,500
discuss them openly so they are

165
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,330
quite important points this

166
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,320
document

167
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,240
I advise you to read it is not

168
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,180
pure legalese so it is quite

169
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,950
discursive and more meager double if

170
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,229
we want to say and therefore I advise you

171
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:55,720
to go and read it

172
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,419
so we can imagine

173
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,940
how this facebook practitioner will be this

174
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,080
is my my version maybe it will be

175
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,150
trojan horse for the common good or maybe it

176
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,680
could be trojan horses for

177
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,800
dummies I don't know we will see when it will

178
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,400
come

179
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,560
when it will come when it will be published let's go and see

180
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,990
what is happening  in italy

181
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,620
it happened that the

182
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,570
law 103 of 2017 was approved therefore the so-called

183
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,640
orlando law which contains a

184
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,299
discipline of the hunters for

185
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,799
investigative use what are the

186
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,860
essential points first of all it is not one the it

187
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,919
is not definitive because it is a delegation law

188
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,700
therefore the government will have  three months of

189
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,900
available time one is already  à

190
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,839
these three months are already running to issue the

191
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,610
legislative decree that

192
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,130
regulates the matter so

193
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,529
we do not yet have the

194
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:03,540
definitive discipline we only have the delegation law

195
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,830
fundamental point only regulates

196
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,959
the remote activation of the microphone of

197
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,180
all the functions that I can

198
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,310
implement controlling

199
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,620
investigative purposes on the target device

200
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,029
I am able for this law to use

201
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,160
only the remote activation of the microphone

202
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,050
and the other question and that applies

203
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,790
you see it exclusively to the

204
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,250
interception of conversations between

205
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,529
present through the emission of

206
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:37,770
computer hunters in

207
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,939
portable

208
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,640
electronic devices words are important  and therefore

209
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,589
this discipline applies only to

210
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:49,740
portable electronic devices and

211
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,790
therefore absurdly if I want to hole up to

212
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,640
place a Trojan on the smart TV that is a bit

213
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,029
too smart of the suspect, I cannot

214
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:02,600
use this new standard because

215
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,700
because I can carry the TV around

216
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,500
but frankly it's not a dispo

217
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,830
portable electronic sitive use the

218
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,990
microphone that some genius places in the

219
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,880
smart fry it is not clear

220
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,880
why it could be done perhaps but

221
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,820
certainly not on the basis of this of this

222
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,290
legislation that applies only to

223
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,779
portable electronic devices so it

224
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,370
is important and this I do not know if you are

225
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,770
they realized that they have

226
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,990
limited their use, however the fact is

227
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,370
that the standard

228
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,560
indicates this and when it can be applied

229
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,900
because this is let's say something more

230
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,040
important

231
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,810
one of the fundamental requirements for

232
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,430
the use of these systems is

233
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,779
proportionality

234
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:47,200
that is I  I cannot use such an

235
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,450
invasive system to go and catch, for

236
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,339
example, who loves who knows who has made a

237
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:53,140
defamation via facebook I

238
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,070
cannot devastate the privacy of one or

239
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,120
more people simply that we all

240
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,970
know very well what the

241
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,480
smartphone or tablet contains  of some

242
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,320
of us

243
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,110
probably contains the life of or in

244
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,430
any case a whole series of information

245
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,410
well beyond  à of those that are

246
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,810
possibly those of interest for

247
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,420
investigations so what are the crimes for

248
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,940
which it can be done there must be serious

249
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,850
indications of crimes some in particular of

250
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,970
some particularly serious

251
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,820
crimes organized crime terrorism

252
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,860
as someone says this is always the

253
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,810
usual  eg dosed for

254
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,540
pedoterrosatanists, that is when something has to

255
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,730
be approved, or child pornography is said for

256
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,110
the worst

257
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,779
pedobear or for terrorism and the mafia and in

258
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:46,750
any case everything goes through

259
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,980
certain areas

260
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,100
and it is obvious that the gravity of the crimes in Chile,

261
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,800
however, pay attention since the  devil is in the

262
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,270
details

263
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,459
this rule says something more says

264
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:00,100
they can also be used for all the

265
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,050
other normal cases in which

266
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,240
the interceptions of

267
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,370
communications in common quotation marks can be reserved

268
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,490
when and therefore also in places of

269
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,800
private residence if they are being

270
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,150
held  criminal activity

271
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,300
but if I like a trojan on a

272
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,240
portable device like I do  to

273
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,300
know where and there the criminal activity is taking place

274
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,440


275
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,779
I have to send the marshal behind

276
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,450
him who follows him and says no attention and singing

277
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,540
at a third party's house he turns off the trojan no he is

278
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,390
leaving healing at his aunt's house

279
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,460
immediately disconnects the train he is

280
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,260
returning home but  they are making a

281
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,300
paste so there is no criminal activity

282
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,940
turns off the trojan

283
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,830
obviously it is not possible and attention

284
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,630
does not regulate

285
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,090
the acquisition of the gps so I am

286
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,070
not able to automate the function

287
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,690
perhaps by entering the perimeter or at

288
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,770
least we do not know if it will be possible to do

289
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,390
the  judge must do however must

290
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,660
indicate why it is necessary for the

291
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,040
conduct of the investigations

292
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,260
but beware this is a stuff the

293
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,320
judges will have the formula to say it is

294
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,810
necessary because it uses whatsapp so

295
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,170
there is encryption that is in to

296
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,810
end encryption for which I have to use trojans

297
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,130
goodbye  and thanks

298
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,410
you can obviously do it being

299
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,830
interception it must be done by the investigating judge but

300
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,890
the prosecutor can also do it in cases of

301
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,590
urgency only  for crimes for the most serious crimes

302
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,840


303
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,600
what this law provides

304
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,720
then we will see what the decree will provide

305
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,360
first of all the activation of the microphone

306
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,090
must be done with a command

307
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,530
sent remotely

308
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,020
so it is not enough to insert the player

309
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,640
but it takes a command it takes the

310
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,600
small button records and so it needs

311
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,780
to be started automatically then

312
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,760
this recording must be

313
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,310
applied by the judicial police

314
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,130
but also by the auxiliaries so it can

315
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,560
also be done by third-party companies

316
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,560
but always on the recommendation of the judicial police

317
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,370


318
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,910
which can cause horror to the technicians

319
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,180
no explicit logging obligation  no

320
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,460
there is only written at the start and

321
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,650
end time of the registration it was already so

322
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,060
for the registrations for

323
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,220
normal interceptions nothing changes

324
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,110
it

325
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,090
is written that the registration however

326
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,920
must be transferred to

327
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,930
the proxy server in order to guarantee

328
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,960
originality in and integrity  the

329
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,380
recordings yes of course because obviously

330
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,640
the recordings  i pass directly

331
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,100
on the proxy server so whoever is

332
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,260
intercepted takes zero comma

333
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,170
seconds to understand that intercepted this

334
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:46,510
is

335
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,160
natural before arriving at and serves

336
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,920
the power of attorney they will do all possible turns

337
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,170
imaginable to

338
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:53,950
avoid discovering

339
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,070
the interception other thing that

340
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,830
obviously belongs more  to magic

341
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,440
more than reality once

342
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,380
the registration ends the player

343
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,910
must be deactivated and made

344
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,520
permanently unusable this

345
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,850
I want 71 turn off the phone no longer has

346
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,730
the device how to do it you can't

347
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,610
understand but in the meantime these are the

348
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,500
rules and therefore I  I imagine since it is

349
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,510
the marshal who must ask to

350
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,330
start precisely I imagine among

351
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,370
other things there are very competent law enforcement agencies

352
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,820
there are others a little less

353
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,350
evident that who will manage these

354
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,420
interceptions will be the company to which they

355
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,540
are entrusted certainly not

356
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,760
judicial police operators who sometimes

357
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,590
unfortunately do not have the level of

358
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,440
competition  Without sufficient I repeat there

359
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,780
are some highly competent law enforcement agencies

360
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,440
and others a little less

361
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,560
there are some legal limits on which

362
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,220
I do not dwell much in the sense that it is

363
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,410
however important to say that they can be

364
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,050
used only for the crimes covered by the

365
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,120
authorization provision therefore we

366
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,760
it will be a problem if the crime changes

367
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,010
but beware it is possible also in

368
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,350
this case the trawling that is they

369
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,850
can also be used for

370
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,520
other crimes that were discovered if they

371
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,140
are crimes for which compulsory arrest is foreseen

372
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,400
in the act

373
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,520
so I put the trogen methods cap  on

374
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,530
dude's phone I grab other

375
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,020
information if it is

376
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,150
relevant information for crimes for which

377
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,980
compulsory arrest in the act is foreseen I

378
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,590
can use it if it is essential and of

379
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,530
course it will become essential most of the time it will

380
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,540
not be possible to

381
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,360
disclose the images of the contents of

382
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,110
strangers but  there are a number

383
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,240
of limits that should

384
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,870
be approved here as well  Founded the thing

385
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,040
we will see will be more fun is this the

386
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,260
trojans must be of

387
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,649
controlled and

388
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,439
guaranteed origin that is they will have to respect the

389
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:03,619
technical requirements on the air that will be

390
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:06,349
contained in the ministerial decree that

391
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,819
will be approved after the

392
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,419
legislative decree we will go and see what will

393
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:14,059
be in this decree  ministerial

394
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:16,189
but the fundamental point is another one that is a

395
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:19,449
juridical question on which it will be necessary

396
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,939
to concretely evaluate what will happen it is

397
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,619
written that only these programs must be used

398
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,659
but it is not

399
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:28,820
just written of unusability these

400
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,760
magic words for a lawyer for a

401
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,799
judge they want  it means a lot

402
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:36,110
that if I use a non-compliant Trojan

403
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,399


404
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:39,620
there is no sanction or it could also

405
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,140
be considered that there is no sanction because it

406
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,270
only does not just mean

407
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,940
unusability and usability and

408
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,799
a sanction expressly that must

409
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,720
be expressly provided for by our

410
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,340
code  of criminal procedure

411
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,409
we will go and see maybe I'm wrong in the

412
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:56,600
decre  to it is written differently but

413
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,230
let's see a bit to close a few words about

414
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,020
what is missing and you will understand there is

415
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,760
no regulation for

416
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,520
online search who login gps

417
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,980
monitoring videorecording what happens

418
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,809
immediately become illegal they

419
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:14,000
are not regulated we do not know

420
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,549
not c  'there is no prescription on logging

421
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:18,590
the activities can be performed by

422
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,299
the judicial police auxiliaries so

423
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,159
exactly as it is happening now

424
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:25,159
there is no transparency there is no

425
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,929
control there is no report

426
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:28,760
to parliament and so on

427
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,890
and there is no standardization  on

428
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,289
vulnerabilities if

429
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:35,390
zero days or other types of

430
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,940
vulnerabilities are used there is no obligation of

431
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,149
a subsequent eventual and after a certain

432
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:43,610
period of time

433
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,700
revelation of the same and therefore

434
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,639
we forget the sentence of the

435
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:53,669
European court of human rights I close with

436
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:57,720
words  di rodotà which in 2008 said that

437
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,279
the sentence of the German constitutional court

438
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,820
that I had cited creates a  new

439
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,490
anthropology according to rodotà on our

440
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,950
physical and technological body we cannot

441
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,380
get our hands the words of rodotà

442
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,679
these are the 2008 I don't know if they are

443
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,659
still valid the principle is valid the

444
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:18,360
reality maybe it is a little different I have

445
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:34,200
concluded and thank you questions you feel

446
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,840
not  I know if it is a little on the side as a question

447
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,370
I do not know if Italy exists the

448
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,389
principle of the fruit of the

449
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:40,970
poisoned tree exists in absolute Italian jurisprudence

450
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,279
then the fruit of the

451
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:48,870
poisoned tree then to be clear the

452
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,480
US theory the fruit would have

453
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,480
poisoned and that if I  I obtain

454
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,149
evidence illegally everything that

455
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:00,049
derives from lawful evidence is

456
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:03,570
invalid in Italy the fruit of the

457
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,120
trained tree is normally good it

458
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,690
magically becomes good veil simplifies there is

459
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,940
constant jurisprudence that if I for

460
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,380
example do a first of illegitimate management it

461
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,190
is however I find  assets whose

462
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:21,929
possession is a crime or for which there is

463
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,610
mandatory confiscation that

464
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,159
search is perfectly valid  from even

465
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,840
if I entered the person's home

466
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,120
without any authorization outside

467
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,440
of the exceptional cases in which I can

468
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,539
enter so let's say that the theory of the

469
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,600
router soon born in Italy is

470
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,690
unfortunately not particularly valid

471
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,760
in case of wiretapping but be

472
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,610
careful if I  I was intercepting

473
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,350
outside the cases provided for by

474
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,020
law

475
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,780
and it is one of the hypotheses of

476
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,900
unusability expressly indicated

477
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,390
then the interception is canceled

478
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,120
even if people say fabric

479
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,490
let's say clearly they are

480
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,700
planning a very serious crime if

481
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,350
the illicit interception those

482
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,120
unusable point

483
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,440
we keep in mind that  however,

484
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,710
jurisprudence constantly says that

485
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,510
useless disabilities are only those that are

486
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,090
expressly sanctioned as such, for example,

487
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,040
there is all the jurisprudence on the

488
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,420
lack of incompleteness of the minutes

489
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,820
and the frauds of wiretapping and

490
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,980
the cassation except for a recent

491
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,680
exception that I spoke about a short time

492
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,950
ago  a course of the csm salvo  a recent

493
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,960
assignment always says

494
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,970
no that the report has been hurt that

495
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,500
for example there are

496
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,750
foreign interpreters whose name is not indicated

497
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,000
is irrelevant because the useless

498
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,730
disability is not expressly combined

499
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,220
for these cases it is imposed for the other

500
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,170
hypotheses if not c  'it is precisely the report is

501
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,840
usable but otherwise no

502
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,800
other questions for troyen used to

503
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,260
simple private investigators who

504
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,540
follow one of the spouses rather than

505
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,920
for a private use of the trojans with it is the

506
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,750
good these positions enter illegal or

507
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,550
when these features in short if

508
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,430
used by the judicial authority

509
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,590
no then private investigators

510
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,830
cannot use them point it is always illegal

511
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,820
because classic hypotheses

512
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,670
marital infidelity and surroundings I like the trojan

513
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:32,410
on my partner's phone of

514
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,380
my partner even if that phone

515
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,840
has no security measures so for

516
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,870
example it has no end so  it is freely

517
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,750
accessible if I place a keylogger

518
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,700
or any other system that is

519
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,710
also it will not be unauthorized access to the

520
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,210
computer system if not for a

521
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,519
protective measure but it will be a violation of the

522
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:56,399
correspondence damage therefore 616 of

523
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:58,889
the criminal code computer damage

524
00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:00,870
illicit treatment of personal data

525
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,590
I feel 667 privacy code and so

526
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:04,919
on

527
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,880
so on the private side there are no margins

528
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,539
of lawfulness in the  sense that it is in any case

529
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,990
an illegal activity,

530
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:19,260
however the fact that this law will

531
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,090


532
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,850
allow the subsequent legislative decree is the circumstance

533
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,549
that they will continue to be

534
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:28,830
private companies that as auxiliary of

535
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,470
the judicial police will manage the

536
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:34,380
interception activities and

537
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,690
huge problems because at

538
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,110
this point they will only be able to do what they

539
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,750
can only make the recordings but

540
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,610
if I am already there I do a

541
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,279
search of the device while I am

542
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,850
inside what happens and this will tell us

543
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,700
the jurisprudence from here shortly

544
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:00,799
we hope other questions

545
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,890
no

546
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,880
nothing  other is fine thanks

547
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:13,669
[Applause]
