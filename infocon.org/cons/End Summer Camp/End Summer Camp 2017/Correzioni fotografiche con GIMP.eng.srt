1
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:07,439
good cop everyone i am andrea and

2
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:10,379
today's talk on the

3
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:13,949
photographic collection gonzi or if for dense the

4
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:17,730
english pronunciation [ __ ] is a

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,560
very complex graphics software what

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,270
I am showing today and they are a

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,060
very simple method to fix the colors

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,330
of the photographs  in a basic way

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,640
we say is that in any case it allows us that the

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,910
improvements on the photos

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,680
then I work I use the

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,510
flyer in free software conscious and

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,649
last year I talked here about

14
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,089
recoverable baits that a data recovery software

15
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:45,019
from ntfs and I am also an

16
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:47,010
administrator of examples  italy which is

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,889
an italian community of

18
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:51,510
users fans of people who use

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,870
[ __ ] and then participate on the

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,989
forum discussions give

21
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,899
each other a hand to use the program it

22
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:04,080
is instead at 4 we will talk about ascob a

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,489
tour that is another some  violent

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,430
free software

25
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,189
this talk is relatively short

26
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:13,860
I will only give you a very brief part of the

27
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,869
theoretical signs on how

28
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,780
images work  ini digital and then how they are

29
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,719
represented and then manipulated by the

30
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,859
software then we see two

31
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:28,829
basic tricks to correct the colors and if there

32
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,180
is a little time we do a

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,310
very quick on how courage

34
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,659
and humility and the colors of the photo is a

35
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,240
first part

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,110
then not  I know how many of you know

37
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,369
how the photographs work

38
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,659
inside the

39
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,850
[Music]

40
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,130
ok then the photographs are saved

41
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,619
in a grid of dots

42
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,989
practically squares all these

43
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,220
pixels together make up the image

44
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,370
these are the raster type images

45
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,170
so each colored dot  and let's say in

46
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,510
its own right the software that manipulates the

47
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,760
photos directly intervenes all

48
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,930
the dots and pixels

49
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,880
this allows us to have a wide

50
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,989
capacity for editing images

51
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,330
we can apply many types of filters

52
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,970
both simple and complex for this type

53
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,810
of images inside each

54
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,370
linux distribution practically you can find two

55
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,040
very well known free software that

56
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,260
are in oc r today  eng today I'm talking about but

57
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,910
the instructions let's say the advice I

58
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,049
have to go through the photos can be

59
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:53,910
applied anyway also concrete ancona

60
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,380
18 the italian community as

61
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,700
[ __ ] italia said this is the

62
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,400
wireless address you want you can participate too

63
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,519
and subscribe to ask for help

64
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,650
on  use of example

65
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,650
or even help other users

66
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,830
then

67
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,410
how is it that you can work in a

68
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,620
simple way on photos to correct

69
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,610
colors and lengthwise what

70
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,440
photographers also recommend in all

71
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,210
the guides you find around is always to

72
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,690
start from the colors first  and then

73
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,550
once the colors have been corrected if you are

74
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,340
a dominant for example red or blue and

75
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,380
if among the remaining ones solves that problem

76
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,000
when that problem has been solved there

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,830
then you move on to correcting the

78
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,950
number and at the end of everything you

79
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,090
can do some retouching  for the

80
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,410
contrast the fact of color courage is

81
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,980
needed at the beginning because then if the colors

82
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,520
are unbalanced when you go for a

83
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,170
correction  do not hesitate there is a risk that

84
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,390
the situation worsens

85
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,890
then it is better to start before the colors

86
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,580
and then move on to 1 st ok it is something that

87
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,350
maybe is not one hundred percent relative to

88
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,108
the colors but I wanted to talk about it since

89
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:22,200
we are a free software community

90
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,669
it reads  often around that the photos

91
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:27,790
found on the internet are free

92
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,750
this is total idiocy the photos if

93
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,640
they are not accompanied the license are

94
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,930
automatically protected by copyright

95
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,180
like all the other works like the

96
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,530
software like everything else so

97
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,750
even when you go to work on the

98
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,880
photos if  you want to take them to insert

99
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,350
these sites and or something like that

100
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,600
always check line without and

101
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,139
possibly also to test

102
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,569
the photographs between the ships and you can

103
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:54,060
find several sites that have

104
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,370
photos with a free license and then you can

105
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,159
use and republish following the

106
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:04,620
license ok then for  understand for a

107
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,479
moment how the collection of photos works

108
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,749
we must have in mind that these pixels

109
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:11,779
that is ques  The colored dots are

110
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:15,449
represented in various ways the most

111
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,749
classic way for images that are

112
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:21,779
digitally stored l rgb this

113
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,000
means that each color is divided into

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,569
three channels and therefore each color has

115
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,000
a quantity of red a quantity of

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,159
blue and a meeting diverge  quantity of

117
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:36,060
blue that when combined together

118
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,529
form the desired color while

119
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,919
usually the contents that are printed

120
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:48,349
are processed and we think in

121
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,330
four-color format which is called cm y cap

122
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,539
that is cyan magenta yellow and black

123
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,060
but this is more related to

124
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,210
printing  then another thing that is

125
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,089
useful for us is the representation of

126
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:05,909
color space lab that is there is a channel that

127
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:07,500
represents only the humidity and is

128
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,089
completely detached from what

129
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:12,149
are the chromatic components then

130
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:14,990
green red blue and yellow

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,389
[ __ ] support  all at all rgb

132
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:21,479
does not perfectly support

133
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,099
four-color process they are working to

134
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,839
improve it if you want to work in

135
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,099
four-color process probably  mind better to

136
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,370
work concretely and also allows the

137
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,169
decomposition in love to do the

138
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:35,490
retouching on the channels green red blue

139
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,089
yellow but the most important tool

140
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:43,169
we will use in this example are

141
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:47,639
the color curves, i.e. they are a

142
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,919
tool that allows us to adjust the

143
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,159
input values  for each channel and

144
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:56,460
decide how they come out

145
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,370
then the values you see on the

146
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,889
horizontal axis from black to white are

147
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,990
the input values at each

148
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,400
input values the curve goes there to represent

149
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,860
what the output value is so that if the

150
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,380
line is  at 45 degrees from bottom

151
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,650
to top the image completely

152
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,400
unchanged instead if I for example

153
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,870
exposed upwards making it become

154
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,830
a curve the line of the channel of the value

155
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,870
that would practically correspond to the

156
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,110
brightness in that case I go to create

157
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,539
a kind of hump at the  'up and that

158
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:31,800
increases the brightness of the image

159
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
because each input

160
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,630
value corresponds to an output value that is

161
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,789
brighter than before  in the

162
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:40,229
same way I can do the same for

163
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:42,740
red for green so if the

164
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,820
amount of red increases I shoot on the

165
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,690
savoy curve decrease it I pull down the curve

166
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,470
this helps us because the peak dots

167
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,000
of the images have the three numerical values

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,720


169
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,870
so I can measure with that

170
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,300
tool and see exactly what is the

171
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,490
number that represents the red what is

172
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,720
the number that represents the green what

173
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,759
the number to present these numbers

174
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,560
I can adjust them using the curves

175
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,150
now let's see how to do it then

176
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,289
starting from the color correction

177
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:18,570
the simplest way to correct a

178
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,240
photo challenge is to consider the fact

179
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,070
that all the points that are white black

180
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,199
or crisis should have the three

181
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,620
values and red green blue equal

182
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,630
so if I see a door a part

183
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,490
of the photo that should be white but

184
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,260
then I go to measure it and I see that the  red

185
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,479
higher than the other two values

186
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,320
means that there is a

187
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,049
dominant red component which means to whom

188
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,409
I should reduce  re the red value in

189
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,040
order to equalize these values

190
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,959
then we can put some

191
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,430
sampling points I suggest then I

192
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,779
show how to do it on the photo measure

193
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,300
where there should be a gray see

194
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,800
if all three values are the same if they are not the

195
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,130
same we remember them so

196
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,520
that become the same by doing it

197
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,900
on the pair of the layer this copy

198
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,670
of the layer we overlay it on the

199
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,590
previous one in color mode which

200
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,940
means that the brightness is not

201
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,940
touched but only the color is changed

202
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,000
and this reduces the dominants

203
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,240
we see a practical example this photo

204
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,680
that unfortunately  with the projector you

205
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,510
can not see very well but it is a photo

206
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,100
that has a red cast and I do not know if

207
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,570
you read the numbers anyway the numbers

208
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,550
and on the side show that those

209
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,820
highlighted in yellow that is the

210
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,850
red values are all higher than the

211
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,320
two others also on the areas that

212
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,690
should be gray

213
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,200
so what happens that we lower

214
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,360
the value with the curves  and of the red in those

215
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,360
points we make them equal to the

216
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,720
blue green and put the copy in color mode

217
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,530


218
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,780
at this point I'm sorry that

219
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,880
probably with this type of power

220
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,570
it is not seen so well but the photo on the

221
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:07,150
right will have a more balanced general appearance

222
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,920
that is the  walls that should

223
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,680
be white or gray or in any case not

224
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,910
reddish you can see that they are white and

225
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,920
gray and in the same way also for

226
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,050
example the chair that has black or the

227
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,390
chandelier that is black is not a

228
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,630
black but it is a true black

229
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,540
therefore in  two steps has been

230
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,510
taken care of color practically the same

231
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,880
way for the brightness what we

232
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,640
recommend to do is to avoid the

233
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,640
extreme values which are zero and 255 but keep

234
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,980
slightly below so the points

235
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,780
of the photo that had to be white are

236
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,680
recommended  keep them at 245 all three

237
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,230
channels and the points that should be

238
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,290
black it is advisable to keep them at

239
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,500
the minimum at 10

240
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,030
this because if you go to put

241
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,310
completely white c  completely black

242
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,710
the photo shows that some

243
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,100
burnt or overexposed or underexposed areas

244
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,400
therefore keeping slightly below the

245
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,800
limit is an aspect however it is

246
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,630
practically white practically black but

247
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,650
without burning the image and then from here

248
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,800
you can adjust the contrast because if

249
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,870
we use the curves  and we make them

250
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,390
have a shape to them practically that

251
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,410
after I show you a

252
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,950
next photo this shape is semi increases

253
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,580
the contrast

254
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,930
so if I want to increase the

255
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,510
contrast instead of making a

256
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,270
simple hump curve I make an as shape and

257
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,690
then this visibly increases  the

258
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,270
contrast but without exaggerating precisely

259
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,830
because we use a curve and not a

260
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,830
straight line and then in the end this is

261
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,510
always done are proper to the layer the

262
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,040
copy of the layer is superimposed in

263
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,740
brightness mode which means that

264
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,710
by making these adjustments we have

265
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,330
completely unbalanced the colors on the

266
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,580
copy but then we will ignore the colors

267
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,350
and consider up  l the

268
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,990
brightness this I hope you see on the

269
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,500
projector it is definitely seen

270
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,810
then the starting photo on the left and

271
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,669
the curves are adjusted so that

272
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:21,169
the whitest point is the one in the small

273
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:23,899
square on the left practically on

274
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:27,979
the penguin's head and that point there

275
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:29,569
is adjusted  so that it is 2 good

276
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:32,899
of 52 40 52 45 the point on the right instead

277
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:34,579
is adjusted so that both of them

278
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,109
10 10

279
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:38,629
at that point I can do some as shape

280
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:40,669
on the curve so you see that it is not

281
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:42,499
really straight but it makes a kind of  they

282
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:44,839
light and this slightly increases

283
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,239
the contrast after which, having

284
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:52,009
positioned the level, is one of the many

285
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:56,839
novelties, something like this

286
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,759
will be seen also on the projector it is not of

287
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:01,159
high quality but it is still perceived

288
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,279
that the photo on the left is definitely

289
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,189
underexposed  slightly low

290
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:08,179
contrast

291
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:11,229
while the photo on the right is correctly

292
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:14,659
exposed and has been adjusted so that

293
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:17,719
the contrast was higher

294
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,759
well I would say we did  tto in time

295
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,259
so we can also do a demo

296
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:26,479
of a few minutes it is ok heard you want

297
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:29,349
to ask me some questions

298
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,209
maybe the questions maybe will come more

299
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:38,290
spontaneously after seeing the curve he said

300
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,450
he showed me first they leave on

301
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,709
the blue level it depends on the photo that is

302
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:48,310
I can adjust them  in a different way

303
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,750
depending on which part I want to

304
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,070
contrast more in the first photo it

305
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,680
will be Greek we see the fourth this

306
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,130
photo has a lot of blue because two thirds of the

307
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,019
sky practically so if I

308
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,130
want to make it appear with the part of

309
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,980
maybe more contrast I want it  the

310
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,800
blues the sky is clearer maybe

311
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,730
contrast and that you can see more

312
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,639
clouds because now it is a

313
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,010
dark blue and slightly lighter blue

314
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,570
for the clouds if I want the clouds to

315
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,070
contrast more

316
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,720
I make the curve be more marked on the

317
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,240
blue then starting  from this photo here

318
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,649
let's say I have a little trouble working

319
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:34,449
for the small resolution words on the

320
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:36,010
small set lets you see a little

321
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,699
better  maybe the writing on your monitor

322
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:41,949
then this is the tool for measuring the

323
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,829
color sampling and here I put

324
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:47,290
the color control points panel

325
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,970
at the bottom right

326
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,100
of the sampling points by holding down

327
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:57,130
the control key and dragging from the

328
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,230
left from a guide or tables at the

329
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,510
top  is always holding against I can

330
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,430
move call call

331
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,180
and place a point now here I read

332
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,649
instead written 193 187 173

333
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:14,490
this photo is quite unbalanced that is

334
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,990
this should be a white or gray wall

335
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,440


336
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,089
instead here there is a tendency towards red

337
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,760
a little goes on green  then I repeat

338
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,160
maybe putting a point here that is darker

339
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,680
here too 134 111 105 are not the same but they

340
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,100
should be and then maybe I put

341
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:42,940
one on let's pretend that we assume

342
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,020
that this person beautiful hair

343
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:49,300
completely black that 28 15 24 if it's

344
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,950
not really we don't  the chair that

345
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,610
was naked is more reliable 35 16 minds you

346
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,300
need it anyway and then maybe a lighter white

347
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,220


348
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,779
let's see if this is okay 210 219 207

349
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,540
this for  straight wait a bit for the blue

350
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:12,430
let's try this can yes ok then I

351
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,380
put four points now I want to

352
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,930
adjust these four points but

353
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,360
before doing anything I make a copy

354
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,100
a duplicate of the layer so that the

355
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,310
layer below remains original and I go to

356
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,830
work on that  above

357
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,990
now that I have a duplicate opens the

358
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:35,550
instrument as well it was false here it is and curves

359
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:41,760
ok then let's try to show everything

360
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,589
well I move a little at a time

361
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:48,070
then starting from the first point if I

362
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,190
move like this with the curves open it

363
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,650
only shows where it goes  on the value

364
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:59,550
on the red on the green and on the blue but if I

365
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,630
hold down control

366
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,980
even here I drag and well that point

367
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,119
we say that I should zoom in at the most

368
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,349
precise but let's pretend that it is

369
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:11,650
right and let go you see that I know that I

370
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,640
made a marker here that I can drag

371
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,099
then rereading the values of primaluna it

372
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,300
was 193 187 173 I leave the average one

373
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,300
fixed and I adjust the other two then

374
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:31,260
rules the 193 which becomes 187 more or less

375
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,210
then it is not ch  and it must be perfect but the

376
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,540
more precise the better

377
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,960
[Music]

378
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,860
and then blue

379
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,860
with the arrows I can also press up and

380
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,040
down ok of course also with the others

381
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,380
a little bit yes yes yes they adjust because

382
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,910
even in these

383
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,130
points not only the  point

384
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,500
dragged here then I repeat the operation

385
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:03,770
with the second maybe here we are

386
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,910
the second now to the blue which is at the

387
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:12,560
intermediate the green one answered I

388
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,780
don't think

389
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,670
and notice that by doing this

390
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,130
I inevitably change the

391
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,870
transition brightness of the image

392
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,090
but then we will discard the  information

393
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,040
on the brightness and keeping only the colors

394
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,350
because we want the correct lengthist

395
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,690
clear was the starting one in short

396
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,050
for the moment then we will retouch it

397
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:40,130
later possibly well now the 31

398
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,880
but nicola pill

399
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,730
and the 3rd green which is low

400
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,470
ok

401
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,690
oh well the fourth I do not do it but you have

402
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,460
understood how the operation

403
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,100
now I do ok this all the

404
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,980
luminist upset but I change

405
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,890
the overlay mode and

406
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:15,390
put it  in color or hue if this is

407
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,830
a development version of jim then

408
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,100
be two different options anyway

409
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,020
color mode that you can also find on

410
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,929
the stable version and now unfortunately

411
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:27,270
perhaps on the proliferation you don't see well

412
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,909
but this was so reddish you can see

413
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,490
that reddish if I apply this  now

414
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,840
I see at all balanced

415
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,020
perhaps those colors slightly faded

416
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,120
a little gray but everything is preferable

417
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,919
so because after I can also increase

418
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:42,710
the contrast of the colors but first I have to

419
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,570
stabilize them corese there once I have

420
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,340
applied this thing I can blend

421
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,650
the photo at the bottom

422
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,330
now if I wanted to work on the

423
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,169
brightness of the left colors of the

424
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:55,850
photo

425
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,350
but here you don't see very well because they

426
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,470
are already quite good enough

427
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,419
I do it here because here you see a

428
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,520
lot more

429
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,990
then this photo let's say home to the

430
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,310
correct colors let's switch to the brightness

431
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,950
then always the sampling points

432
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,360
now I'm interested  first look for

433
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,460
the point on the white of the photo that

434
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,110
which should be perfectly white

435
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,150
is the blackest point which should be

436
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,060
perfectly black one thing you can

437
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,820
do is use the threshold tool which is

438
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,010
under colors all the time and move until

439
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,410
you see everything disappear and the points that

440
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,290
are blackest remain so let's say

441
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,840
this piece of water  it will be the blackest point

442
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,790


443
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,460
if I move here I see that the

444
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,380
whiter part of the photo is practically

445
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,590
this piece of the head of the pil and

446
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:56,590
then drag a point here and a point

447
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,399
you see in this photo and very dark

448
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:05,350
because it almost wrote 168 159 154 ok

449
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,850
not  it's perfect but let's pretend it's

450
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,909
gray and this should be 245

451
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:11,559
because it would be total white so it's

452
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:13,750
very dark the photo below

453
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,809
89 is practically correct so this

454
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,720
part here will remain so now

455
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,529
I always do it I do a duplicate use of

456
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:28,269
curved colors I go  to place point

457
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:30,580
2 first because we have seen that it is

458
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,939
practically right so it will remain so

459
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,450
ok if I have not done it precisely we do

460
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:47,190
pretend it is right and point 1 instead

461
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,220
I go

462
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,630
here

463
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,190
then just one I go to adjust it

464
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:59,910
so the red must become 245

465
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,550
you see that here at the top right is

466
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,070
cutting really sharply but

467
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,780
actually mark the graph

468
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,340
the histogram behind there are no points

469
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,350
that have  values that had beyond

470
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,490
so I'm not running away from the pixel

471
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,190
because there is no pixel that goes

472
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,620
beyond this line so here I can do

473
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,300
what I want nothing happens

474
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,010
what matters is on the left but now

475
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,770
I'm done do the same thing with

476
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,160
green

477
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:37,840
we do the same thing that blue

478
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,470
problems now we come to the discourse

479
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,760
of the

480
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,010
second knowledge of how to rule for example the

481
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,890
wolf 3 adjust it so I think that the effect

482
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,190
between on the photo then go on the red

483
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,940
pull a little here is the red since the

484
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,310
lower part of the reds is more red  it

485
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,520
lights up if I shoot on red while the

486
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,540
sky is less affected let's say face ok

487
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,020
now this puts it in

488
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:19,560
brightness mode value but indeed it is still on

489
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,700
value  it would be

490
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,370
and then we see practically this was

491
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,890
before this is the

492
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,049
color correction there is the collection sorry the

493
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,390
brightness of the color corruption

494
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,860
had done on other photos and of course

495
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,830
I could even if it seems too much I

496
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,010
reduce it a bit of opacity and until it goes

497
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,960
well though

498
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,340
than before I would say that the length view

499
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,000
is much better adjusted well we

500
