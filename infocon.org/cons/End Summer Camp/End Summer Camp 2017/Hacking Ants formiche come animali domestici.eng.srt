1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,129
my top tonight is a talk it is

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,270
quite alternative but there is a

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,110
passion for never came a couple of years

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,630
ago and this maybe is the right place where

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,480
you can also appreciate things so mars

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,119
then we will talk about ants point and

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,160
how some species  of ants are

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,390
really skilled hackers I would like to start by

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,920
saying this there are those who did not spend

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,140
their childhood torturing them provided that there

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,000
are a thousand ways to torture

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,679
them myself not tied with water

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,420
I burned with fire with the can

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,090
of deodorant there  I put the detergent in

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,059
it I put paint in and

16
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:39,570
so on and so forth

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,700
and there is some more artist who

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,430
hides behind the art to slaughter them the

19
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,000
worst way that is they throw

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,449
molten aluminum in their holes but the

21
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,850
ants are with  maybe if you know a

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,440
little better i can go some

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,480
fun besides killing them the

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,440
bad ways then i did a

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,409
google trends search predict auto who launches

26
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,640
how is the search for this phrase and

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,990
the ants stand there  or always on the [ __ ]

28
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,869
but particularly in the summer there is in the summer

29
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,670
we have just the English

30
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,290
summer peak where there are really so much

31
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,030
on the case and all the related searches

32
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,729
are of ancient pesticides

33
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,520
very bad things so that among other things many

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,110
poisons of the  ants are very bad

35
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,090
because they attack just how they

36
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,430
transmit the cerebral signals ceo for

37
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,930
what they have of the brain and

38
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,329
therefore they die just limit evil more

39
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,740
know him then but there are

40
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,600
reasons why in addition to slaughter

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,720
ants we could also raise them then

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,040
beppe viola in the meantime  some reasons then

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,119
to the various ants it is not how to raise

44
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,610
grasshoppers there is the grasshoppers every

45
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,939
individual and single does his thing and bon

46
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,799
but the ants have an

47
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,960
internal social structure that can be

48
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,210
interesting year they are defined and

49
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,570
social for certain reasons that I

50
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,719
will explain later is  very easy because or you

51
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,360
start with little it costs very little just a

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,250
little space will make your parents happy

53
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,920
bar wife a

54
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,370
lot and it costs little because it was

55
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,010
four pieces of cement the a bag

56
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,300
of chalk in the pot after nonsense and

57
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,010
just after I will talk about why they are

58
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,540
also skilled hackers under some

59
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,340
conditions

60
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,700
and then absurdly there is a forum with

61
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,220
many active people in Italy is

62
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,380
depressed one of the largest in the world of

63
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,209
people who raise ants so if

64
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,340
you want to stop ovens you must be

65
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,540
proud of being

66
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,480
Italian apparently there is some reason there

67
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,950
we were talking about euro sociality set

68
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,380
what is this word then the

69
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,470
ants  and other insects hayden that

70
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,360
these here are the social insects yes they

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,810
are the ants the bees the thermals and

72
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,890
those enough wasps they too

73
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,569
then what this particular this

74
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,239
this social structure then there is a

75
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,430
cooperative offspring care that is they go

76
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,769
after the children also of  those others is

77
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:16,470
a particular thing there is a

78
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,780
particular thing in the animal kingdom and then

79
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,760
even more strange is that they live in groups

80
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,230
here and there in groups  po where only

81
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,570
some reproduce and others do not

82
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,220
others take care they take to eat they look after

83
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,280
the children of those others there is a

84
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,810
division of tasks

85
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,489
that is there are individuals who do

86
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,620
certain things there are worker ants

87
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,209
that goes well they do the workers bring

88
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,310
forward the food they feed the larvae

89
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,510
or there may be the

90
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,480
soldier ants they have may have different

91
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,660
tasks dependent on the spice

92
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,450
some are used to chop the seeds others to

93
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,150
fight the enemies that it has given us

94
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,380
and the interesting thing is that

95
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,450
the evolution produced morphological changes

96
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,850
to these different castes where

97
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,280
an ant belonging to one caste

98
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,959
can no longer do what

99
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,760
an ant departing from another caste does and

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,720
this is one of the

101
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,090
essential things of this definition, well

102
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,380
he got it very interesting that there is  it is

103
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,930
an equal structure there are only

104
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,519
insects but also in moles there is a

105
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,798
kind of moles that has the mother mole

106
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,238
that the one that reproduces of others does not

107
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,440
but very interesting

108
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,290
well the ants have a particular life cycle

109
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,300
okay it's not what kind the

110
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,100
ants are born from a hole

111
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,200
bond ants are born that is they have a certain cycle

112
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,120
starting from the eggs that are laid

113
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,610
by the Reggio ant the eggs become

114
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,810
larvae the pupae larvae in this step

115
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,490
depending on something like how

116
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,410
what they eat how they are treated they can

117
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,080
become provided workers males and

118
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,720
queens or even soldier ants in

119
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,580
some species

120
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,200
oh well it's more or less here we have a

121
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,620
day more or less from egg to

122
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,300
ant thirty days go by

123
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,460
then you can see  various phases this is

124
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,110
another there is no place this is a

125
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,760
larva to the largest lava an

126
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,960
even larger larva

127
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,830
a pupa is a policy but then to

128
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,870
start for an anthill how to

129
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,340
start you must first find a

130
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,230
Reggio ant and how it was found  the ant from

131
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,300
Reggio you have to find the

132
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,370
right time in this Italian forum there is a

133
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,990
beautiful table with the various

134
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,580
species I had pre  I know the spices that are found

135
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,650
with us

136
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,330
then I like this ant here

137
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,340
I can find it here ok its more or less

138
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,970
how big is the period in which it

139
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,310
shama so I find these ants

140
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,750
resins in this period so I

141
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,919
go around

142
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,900
I find some winged beasts I don't

143
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,490
kill them all thinking that they are

144
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,169
mosquitoes I look at them first a moment are

145
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:43,090
go kill them and they are queens put them

146
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,610
in a box this is the way

147
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:52,140
you start how I can recognize

148
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:59,770
and so a mini how to recognize  the

149
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,690
ants queens to the alices I find a

150
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,620
beast to the wings we assume that it is

151
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,169
a supplied this beast to the wings

152
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:14,460
then it can be a queen a male

153
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,750
there are small differences between the

154
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,729
two okay after a while you do the eye you

155
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:21,159
are little at the beginning  a bit difficult but

156
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:22,449
still you can test

157
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,810
all the many males after a while they die

158
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,819
if it dies it was probably a male and

159
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,830
after a while you learn anyway and

160
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,500
let's face it it may not be

161
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,509
fertilized  is still loyal let's talk

162
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,569
about this first if I find 2 with wings

163
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:40,539
in the same period its place and a

164
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,099
big one a small one to the small one the

165
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:43,750
male the big one the queen so

166
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,090
I take the big one generally year

167
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,280
the biggest wait year the gastro that

168
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,830
the  the big ass that the eggs will have to

169
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,620
lay the problem that I find it with the

170
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,849
wings could be that it is not

171
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,979
fertilized so I find it the

172
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,569
test tube despite an ant from Reggio

173
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:01,210
does nothing lives there a year without

174
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,240
doing anything because the queen ants after

175
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,159
a  po when they are fertilized they lose their

176
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,590
wings so it may be that I find it

177
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,639
when it has no wings

178
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,949
so it has no wings it can be a

179
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:15,370
queen a worker a soldier it even

180
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,469
here if I find many ants many

181
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:19,120
small within one much larger in the

182
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,620
its place probably the great one from

183
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,789
Reggio but after a while it makes the eye

184
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:26,169
so here we have some photos just

185
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,330
to recognize

186
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,939
then for a moment now that it is

187
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:32,470
around 11 past not  I am more in the

188
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,599
protected range and we can we can take the

189
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,229
one with the integral if no one is

190
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:41,319
upset however you see the difference

191
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,000
in size this is the male is

192
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,810
very small then what I said

193
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,180
before if an ant from Reggio I find it

194
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,189
without wings the way to recognize it and

195
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:53,110
this is the province of Reggio

196
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,759
compared to the other ant generally

197
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,500
authorized and much more massive

198
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,870
and to these which are the wing scars

199
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,849
because at the beginning she had the wings she

200
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,979
lost them however she still has these scars

201
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:05,440
so if behind an ant you tour with

202
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,090
a good I know  a lens at home

203
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,129
you look at it well and then it is a

204
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:11,259
queen and without liquids and fertilized

205
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:16,050
therefore and the right ant shopping for you

206
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,259
then

207
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,940
so I find my ant in Reggio what

208
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,620
do I do with it then what it would be

209
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,680
now is a test

210
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,990
tube usually there is evenings  to buy them the

211
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,550
gimmicks are beautiful those of very

212
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,219
transparent m of a large diameter and bob

213
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,349
if not you go to the pharmacy take those

214
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:33,940
for the urine  that sucks are

215
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,099
opaque but it costs a little and not beautiful

216
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,269
itself

217
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:38,679
then how to prepare the test tube for

218
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,870
the reggina then you go you do not see

219
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,729
anything but in the end it puts some

220
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,740
water in it puts you

221
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,870
in a cotton cap up  after all,

222
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,250
let's say to leave this

223
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,260
water chamber if this serves the queen because

224
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,730
she needs a humid environment you

225
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,529
put the reggina inside and then you

226
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,810
put the finished button on top so it's

227
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,829
cheap

228
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,060
you can put a drawer inside and

229
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,720
forget about it because for the most

230
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,980
part  of ants that we find here we

231
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,050
have a type of cloistered foundation

232
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,620
that is the ant alone without eating

233
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,209
lays its eggs and eats only

234
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:12,339
when the first workers are born that

235
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,709
often just spend a month two months

236
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,180
so for almost two months from Reggio

237
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,550
I do not eat for others  especially, however,

238
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,529
you should understand what kind of reggina

239
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,660
and it is not really an easy thing it would

240
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,519
be to drink something to eat but in any

241
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,370
case 90 percent is not  erve at a certain

242
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,750
point you will see that the first workers are born

243
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,750
and then you can guess what

244
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,399
you can feed the

245
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,300
ants

246
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,279
to the priest give honey in the brown

247
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,720
sugar of the biscuits

248
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,009
tension another thing I have noticed that

249
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:40,180
the ants in my house eat  of everything

250
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,819
that is, those that I do not have if I find them

251
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:44,199
around I drop a biscuit they eat the

252
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:47,729
biscuit if I give it to them I do not eat it

253
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,129
yes it is so so of proteins you can

254
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,259
give insects and mosquitoes so you have a

255
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,879
reason to kill mosquitoes and

256
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,360
keep them and  then what a beautiful death it is if

257
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,920
the blow and then wash devour by

258
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,949
another insect what he deserves leo is

259
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:11,319
also the wasps you can give me eggs

260
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,949
ham oh well tone a bit of everything

261
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:18,639
even the salami then then just bone

262
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,199
you have this ant in the test tube after

263
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:22,089
a  po the first workers were born and

264
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,589
when you can rai they start to be as many as

265
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,660
about fifty

266
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,310
you have to find a job a little

267
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,279
better than in a test tube there are

268
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,680
anthills atri artifice  them to whom you can

269
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,750
build the artificial anthill is

270
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,740
divided into two parts

271
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,629
if the real anthill is

272
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:39,069
practically the part that generally

273
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:41,910
if underground where they live and then

274
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,439
if you can see that right after in the

275
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:46,050
meantime I will show it better

276
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,459
and then there  it is a part of arena that what

277
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:50,110
your garden should be

278
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,790
so a part from a ring they can

279
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,040
go around and then find food and

280
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,420
these two things are usually connected

281
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,279
by a pipe

282
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,079
to this then a plaster anthill like

283
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:00,730
the smaller one  that you see the buoy

284
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,019
after the case as I show it

285
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:04,480
better it is very simple to do just a

286
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,309
jar buy a lot of plaster from the

287
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:08,980
jug and then with a screwdriver when

288
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,360
it is not yet completely hard to make a

289
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,120
few holes and bob usually

290
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,769
just leaves  a space underneath that is

291
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:16,990
filled with water with a plaster foot

292
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,459
in such a way as to keep the

293
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,920
plaster moist enough that the

294
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,959
ants like to live in a humid environment

295
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,089
if not  as an alternative we have an

296
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:26,470
anthill in gasbeton these here

297
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,920
are tiles that are found by the

298
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,540
parents of building materials cost

299
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,759
a couple of euros you scratch them anyway for

300
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,470
an afternoon with an afternoon to do

301
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,290
this graced and bon this here is an

302
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,970
example of an arena that I put  a bit of

303
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,559
cactus a bit of sand connected with a

304
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,930
tube from here to this here if not inside

305
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,279
the ants if you file it they are all dead

306
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,529
so luckily for you I was able to

307
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:48,580
bring it

308
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,840
now I can talk about the bio

309
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,460
hacking part that is the real reason why yes

310
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,360
can talk about ants at esp then

311
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,860
about one of the species of ants that I have

312
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,180
who then don't bring a test tube

313
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,590
with some ants where I can

314
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,500
show them if in general fable is that a

315
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,000
particular genus of ants and in

316
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,830
Italy there is a  race of there is a species

317
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,920
of this ant in addition to the

318
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,870
queen ants and the worker ones could see

319
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:17,480
that even the soldiers ok there are 1100

320
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,910
species of this of this genus and

321
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,190
suffer a hundred sol  so much 8 in

322
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,810
addition to the normal soldier they produce

323
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,340
these other ants that

324
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,340
are super soldiers ok even the

325
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,990
fired ones are asked but why out of

326
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,230
1,100 species only 8 produce these

327
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,570
ants it turned out that on the others

328
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,790
on the other species at least on

329
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,600
most of the other species

330
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,720
the  gene of these ants is still there

331
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,220
but the ants don't do what they

332
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,860
should do to awaken it so

333
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,120
they have the ability to make these

334
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,070
super soldiers but they don't they have

335
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,030
lost the ability to do it but using a

336
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,960
pheromone we can stimulate them looks so

337
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,330
super soldier  and the nice thing is that there is

338
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,740
a chemical product that mimics this fair

339
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,870
hormone is used as an insecticide

340
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,100
and can be bought on ebay

341
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,360
so with 53 dollars you can not know what you

342
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,790
say aldo ranieri is when he brings you a

343
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,270
bottle of this thing but it is and

344
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,140
i haven't had time to

345
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,200
buy it yet but i will definitely and

346
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,640
so how does the story

347
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,950
pretty much work when the ant lays a

348
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,560
new  vo and then from man it becomes a larva if a

349
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,000
first biological switch because obviously

350
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,029
because soldier worker queens ants

351
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:38,520
not all the same DNA hand of the genes

352
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,470
that can be stimulated or not and

353
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,380
produce morphological differences

354
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,540
if we then there is a first switch that

355
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,580
decides if the larva  becomes an ant from

356
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,070
Reggio or something else and we leave this to

357
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,810
do there is a second switcher

358
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,779
who decides to become a worker soldier

359
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,910
yes we between these two suites we

360
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,390
administer this thing we can

361
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,630
practically obtain that instead of

362
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,110
choosing between these two normal switches,

363
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,610
pass a certain threshold we

364
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,190
wake up the switch  of the super soldier

365
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,630
so they managed in the laboratory to

366
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,520
obtain species that could no

367
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,880
longer do it precisely this

368
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,350
forgotten form and no longer useful from

369
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,240
an evolutionary point of view second and this is a

370
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,630
very interesting thing

371
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,550
enough this had been started

372
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,070
if you have questions curiosity then I know if

373
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,440
you are  curious after come to me or a

374
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,970
box with the prov  and with the

375
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,290
queens you can see them

376
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,639
the super soldiers fight

377
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:54,220
let's say that the purpose of the super soldier

378
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,029
was to have a very large head and if

379
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:59,860
you see they have a very large head and

380
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,990
their purpose was to block

381
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,110
the entrance to the anthill in fact all the

382
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,610
species that  they have lost them because when

383
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,680
they arrive they happen to blow them no

384
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,600
instead those who have kept these

385
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,319
are there and plug the holes await

386
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:22,630
the beginnings but then we can

387
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,120
create the super soldier and maybe

388
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,680
start some

389
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,769
clandestine fighting of ants super soldier

390
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,230
then me once  them all on a

391
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,860
table the test tubes ok and I had one t

392
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,360
by mistake open and some

393
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,100
ants came out and I left it open because

394
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,079
after a while they come back inside forgetting

395
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:43,360
about this I did other things on

396
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,589
another property it is done is that even

397
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:47,680
a  another test tube is left open

398
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,060
I'm in another room saying ah

399
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,920
well now I'll be back in a while to see how

400
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,029
the situation

401
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:53,230
is back I'm back by he found  after the

402
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,170
slaughter of dead ants everywhere there

403
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,850
are brutally massacred I

404
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,220
could not witness this massacre

405
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,380
so it was a bit useless but I

406
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,910
would put with 33 the purposes of breeding

407
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,139
ants it could be to

408
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:11,230
organize bets fights

409
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,589
why not

410
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:26,410
I pray inside the test tube

411
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,080
before making the  migration to how many

412
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,060
ants arrive this is the first

413
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,570
question

414
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,490
the second once placed in the

415
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,610
labyrinth of sex like him usual

416
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,090
the outside to see and the third I saw

417
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,630
that tile the shroud in the gallery

418
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,450
and a bit too wide for the ants yes

419
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,270
I  I made it wrong and that I had a

420
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,100
screwdriver with a wide tip and that

421
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,560
width I did and I will do another

422
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,320
better for the other questions then it is

423
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,660
how informative they clarify depends on whether there

424
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,510
are ants and in the test tube yes if they are

425
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,609
very small I would wait even a

426
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,859
hundred  workers and there are a lot of

427
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:14,079
hail about fifty and in order not to let them

428
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,150
escape then there are several ways

429
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,060
usually grease the walls  i of the container

430
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,920
with vaseline oil vaseline grease

431
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,959
various mixtures between the two

432
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,660
I found in the hardware store the

433
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,750
dry Teflon spray that works very well but

434
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,280
after two months all the

435
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,560
ants died so you should try it

436
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,890
other times I do not recommend it yet

437
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,860
sorry the fourth ok  50 ants in the

438
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,130
test tube capped with cotton and she is

439
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,650
seen to remove the cotton from there and the

440
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,640
beast died from a wasp and close it again yes

441
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,580
in fact after when on 50 because

442
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,950
the tail starts to be difficult yes

443
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,320
yes yes it is true in fact mine do not  more

444
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,870
to eat at night almost if I give it to them

445
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,940
less often I still have to move them yes

446
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,860
because after a certain moment there are

447
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,090
so many that when it

448
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,790
opens they come out for sure then

449
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,770
if they come out 3 4 I leave

450
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,140
them out I kill them and bond

451
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,640
and if  they are the few who die for

452
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,240
the common good

453
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,940
and if they come out a lot is there or you

454
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,630
let them experience them come back or you

455
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,720
love them suits or on those are the

456
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,640
alternatives

457
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,110
please asi p  Anyway I meant that

458
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,760
I am not a biologist so the things

459
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,140
I have said may very well not be

460
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,840
one hundred percent accurate

461
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:53,290
disclaimer it is possible to

462
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,020
install distributed algorithms that

463
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,780
use ants like the stationary

464
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,950
paths they use to get around

465
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,420
of the areas where they must not go

466
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,270
of the roads where to do it but

467
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,450
surely, however, if the beauty of what

468
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,970
we immediately say to king is that we say

469
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,170
that a chemical product that minimizes

470
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,330
these hormone fortunately used

471
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,910
as a biological insecticide and therefore

472
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,770
can be found is the  its this fair

473
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,240
hormone that they use for example to

474
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,400
say that there is food if I don't know if you

475
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,510
can buy it at an

476
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,790
acceptable price but then I didn't say

477
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,500
that other let's say fair hormone that is

478
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,420
found convinces guys why it is  a

479
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,010
pheromone that prevents the larva from

480
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,430
becoming pupa so if I give the

481
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,170
insects that eat my salad it does not

482
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,330
become a pupa

483
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,190
it becomes a larva and then dies

484
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,440
So let's say I kill them but without

485
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,720
poisoning everything so this is

486
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,380


487
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,900
exactly organic

488
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,250
yes a lot to them the room but I don't think they

489
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:08,840
eat it yes if you are interested and

490
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,760
insect fights there is a beautiful site at least

491
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,450
what is only for a few years japanese

492
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,660
bug  fights dot.com that is beautiful yes

493
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,840
or those of the emotional grains is the

494
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,059
commentary on the illegal insect fights

495
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:26,000
in japan I knew there was a

496
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,990
market it is very good and divas japanese bug

497
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,289
files dot.com but you have to go to

498
