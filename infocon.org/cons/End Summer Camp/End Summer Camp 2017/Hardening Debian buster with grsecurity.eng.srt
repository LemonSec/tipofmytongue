1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,080
good evening everyone for the second time

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,330
who comes in now I am fabio carletti

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,590
and I come from the marches macerata

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,730
[Music

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,170
] I usually deal with

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,360
computer security so I have my own life and

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,699
I advise companies on

8
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,539
legal accountants and so on

9
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:25,310
then

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,380
this is a sweet  very difficult because

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,119
to understand these things here you have to

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:37,820
see who is high enough I

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,329
wanted to deal with this topic because

14
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,469
currently the top top self-confident gers

15
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:48,769
is available to do some sort of

16
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:52,100
serious and complete hardening to the kernel

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,409
and then we will also see the differences between  gl

18
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:05,630
ssec selinux and apparmor then because if

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,880
I go doctor ae not heard

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,740
me recently I deal with IT security

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,850
consultancy and let's say that I approached

22
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,049
the world of open source since 98

23
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,929
attending the university jul and from

24
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:29,270
there I have always been passionate

25
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,090
about free software  open source and

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,610
especially the unix world and operating systems

27
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,649


28
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:39,860
then why I wanted to hook geres

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,440
7 to debi  n especially it was now I

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,090
liked it also can sponsor the

31
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,340
quotes the new devia testing that

32
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,289
host low and that if you know that the

33
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:57,470
names of the debian versions are

34
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,830
nothing but the puppets of

35
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,680
the of the cartoon and toy story film in which

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,500
the unstable version of  debian is

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,620
called sid because sid is the child who

38
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,480
breaks toys on the cardboard while

39
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,470
the puppets of the house so the

40
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:25,200
dinosaur vd ex

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,900
jersey are all the names and the puppets

42
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,450
that are in the room of

43
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,650
the cartoon character and brands are good so

44
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,250
release stable have names  of the toys

45
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,410
we say good ok

46
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,740
yes the sid version is unstable because it looks

47
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,600
like child cats or bing

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,270
mentally unstable no dangerous

49
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,709
so debian makes wisely 3 3

50
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:57,430
versions the stable the testing and the sid

51
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,140
that we say experimental for

52
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,720
geeks but that is not recommended band

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,850
production because it would be a bit like a

54
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,840
leap into the void while the stable is by

55
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,510
gaber the servers, in short,

56
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,209
production is also  and testing is not

57
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,070
all in short, the jar now bacchetti

58
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,380
have a sort of are taken from the sid

59
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,430
and are considered eligible to pass

60
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,870
we can sells in the

61
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,250
stable Italian version

62
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:39,050
then because already from sex sells sec

63
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,170
then I start from the assumption that

64
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,270
those who have followed my pain  last year

65
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,440
I was talking about

66
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,620
debian hardening using the

67
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,590
man project may that it was a kind of

68
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,200
castration of the kernel at a paranoid level

69
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,220


70
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,200
because basically how you want

71
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,100
I don't know if you know that zero days is

72
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,070
problem of computers with linux of

73
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,180
online services and that if  a service

74
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,230
is made known in reality a few years

75
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,000
before it is already known to those above us

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,320
I am talking about the inter chicken I am

77
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,330
talking about the nsa and similar stories

78
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,270
so before in general it works so

79
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,530
before the bug is discovered all

80
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,870
shut up it is used for  i comfortable them

81
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,950
and then only a few years is made known

82
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,420
and the way in which

83
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,270
a classic systems engineer has changed a classic that

84
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,140
can do you keep if s  we

85
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,300
updated more can not help unless he is

86
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,270
able to disassemble and have

87
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,700
technical knowledge or to write

88
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:06,430
10 gods after the mauden scandal we

89
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,640
realized that the thing is more serious than

90
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,930
what was thought from the point of view

91
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,120
of privacy  and of the security in which

92
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,320
you are the nsa that does and the tolfa this

93
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,660
is the toll to make that other and similar stories

94
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,290


95
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,870
such that now in america all the

96
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,860


97
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,040
agr hacker groups for who is once who comes to the

98
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,460
bait and is  starting to hang out

99
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,250
computer science it is not criminals hager and

100
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,360
researchers want to play on wikipedia

101
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,380
aguero is a researcher who writes

102
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,330
interesting things for the community it is not a lager

103
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,090
equal to a criminal who breaks the boxes

104
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,340
because there is nothing to do

105
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,110
anyway in america any group

106
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,990
whatsoever they do not accept  a

107
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,380
normal game that is they all say brand

108
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,300
at least you have to stay in front of gr

109
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,720
sec columns and various tricks because the

110
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,670
mentality the approach the way for years

111
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,210
if what I do not know what  that I can

112
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,730
try because I do not have the knowledge and

113
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,240
I do not know to prevent

114
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,630
I think paranoid in paranoia what fashions

115
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,900
and I have to invite them possible that

116
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,630
tomorrow someone discovers something and somehow

117
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,840
comes to compromise me in a system

118
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,840
so

119
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,979
let's say that after a scandal from the eight and

120
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:36,080
similar stories in most

121
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,050
communities the bar has been raised very very

122
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,550
very much so much so that

123
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,350
a project has also recently been done which will then

124
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,770
resume some features of the sec which

125
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,190
then went asti to explain in detail

126
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,740
what this project does

127
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,280
these precautions for  the kernels

128
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,919
in fact know forks of known operating systems

129
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:04,190
such as a dinner and free bsd

130
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,330
at all hardening bsb in which it also

131
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,010
takes up a bit of

132
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,229
robben bsd's speech that there are a whole series

133
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:14,810
of protections for the stack for the kernel

134
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,020
for calls system bella flo

135
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,830
etcetera etcetera that we find in jerez

136
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,070
sec

137
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,470
unfortunately

138
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,970
who has to put on a web server

139
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,180
some service exposed web knows that it is

140
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,190
at the mercy of the botnet and  various attacks the

141
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,949
script and randomized that go to

142
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:47,470
defrost learned all ip address to

143
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,130
reger some water official falls

144
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,070
that bring from some bug payroll service

145
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,100
yesterday I was talking to the

146
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,680
wordpress developer and he said look as soon as a bug comes out

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,130
I don't have time that is we didn't

148
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,900
even beat  publish it that has dates are the

149
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,910
botnets you go I was looking for burberry to hole

150
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,789
the servers that is the sites with wordpress facts by

151
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,100
freezing that most of the

152
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,310
people

153
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,620
unfortunately from bad system engineers do not

154
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:27,169
remember update all remove peace

155
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:32,510
security and similar stories jarret jack has

156
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,210
a preventive approach hammond  that is,

157
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:40,070
I don't know if any 6 some service

158
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,960
knows something broken

159
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,820
I don't know if some program has

160
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,160
really been done with flaws

161
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,870
deliberately to be exploited

162
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,290
remotely

163
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,390
I don't know if a series of numbering

164
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,770
generates me guards buffer overflow by

165
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,280
hans beck  it is an approach that goes

166
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,320
correctly to the world and that is to say I owe

167
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,690
life as much as possible things that also n

168
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,700
I do not know that they could happen

169
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,330
within my system whose services you provide and

170
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,350
is hooking up on the internet

171
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,520
so more than anything else jarret jack is

172
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,770
oriented to the systems engineer so we are

173
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,430
talking now we will delve into the

174
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,279
technical discourse in which one must have the

175
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,180
skills and must because in short  he knows where to

176
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,330
get his hands dirty because he wanted to

177
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,730
hook it degan because I like it ties it is

178
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,730
like this because we say that

179
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,790
[Music]

180
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:57,640
the redacted branch relies a lot on palmor

181
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,180
if you have used su se already on the

182
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,090
auctions is the wizard to

183
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,960
configure apparmor and them  the love from

184
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,180
the jam is more gone to palmor

185
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,980
while ubuntu while also debian or

186
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,130
others seen selinux and therefore often

187
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,350
played on the internet discussions but it is

188
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,920
better to apparmor or it is better if linux are

189
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,500
two different ways of approaching the

190
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,200
system it is also true via selinus sta

191
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,750
developing from the nsa it is also true that in

192
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,930
parma there is not enough documentation

193
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,930
on 100 debian branch of the and one to a

194
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,030
more per-dominant approach  i

195
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,230
to try to stem the songs and therefore

196
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,780
any problems that could

197
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,150
arise from the execution service while

198
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:57,100
the other goes a speech of the cl

199
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,490
so

200
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:05,510
if I sincerely on state

201
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,080
opensuse tents for several years being in

202
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,340
parma must food

203
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,760
and streets state for me it is one thing  more

204
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,290
logic was to use what they already

205
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,360
give you that you know that it works and there is no

206
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,150
problem even if there are different

207
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,780
levels in which it really goes to try to

208
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,700
stem any problems using

209
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,160
bundu

210
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,769
that is all the calls all the features

211
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:39,649
for itself linux or used if  linux is

212
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:43,480
quite simple to use but

213
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,250
let's compare one and the other

214
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,199
then as I said before apparmor more

215
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:55,220
ramon relax used selinux close

216
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,800
vian we were bundu even if not right

217
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,139
the documentation allow parma on

218
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:02,420
debian so one has to improvise a bit

219
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:08,480
geek turn have

220
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,600
However,

221
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,320
we say different approaches and philosophical choices to try

222
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,140
some way to give security to the

223
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,210
server of one's workstat  ion, on the other

224
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,630
hand, I like jarrett jack very much

225
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:32,910
because he makes a much more intimate conversation

226
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:39,680
with the kernel or if I for example

227
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,320
have had experiences in which zero

228
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,850
days come out years hobo years or leaks

229
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,220
that are not known and come out when

230
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,630
you least expect it

231
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,910
I prefer to have a more

232
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,920
upstream approach that is

233
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,870
for safety I try to raise the

234
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,430
standard possible within the

235
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,149
kernel is among the nice things instead they are

236
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:13,339
as you can read there is the famous pax and

237
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,240
many privileges that is many features that

238
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,870
if linux and apparmor  they do not have an example it

239
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,990
could be to do the buffer

240
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,820
overflow wherever

241
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,270
there are statistics in which I took

242
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,480
three computers 1 woman palmor 1 posterino

243
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,910
if one after jerez sec for when we

244
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,180
would like to make a hole a service

245
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,560
then at the same version of the

246
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,510
services a  vulnerability equality

247
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,680
let's say

248
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,700
jerez note is that what avoids me practice

249
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,920
makes new possibility must

250
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:04,030
then escalate it is nothing it is not alive

251
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,590
prevent everything  some buffer

252
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,680
overflows so even a

253
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,290
crazy program written badly by the user

254
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,040
here I am sure that the more it gives the more giving the more the

255
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,390
more mess it cannot do

256
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,030
in short at the level of my workstation

257
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,769
and

258
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:22,889
psychologically making it safer

259
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:26,860
than the approach to cl or pur of the

260
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:33,519
domain  that there is in parma and if linux I

261
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,029
work degan and therefore I am productive in

262
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,119
which it goes to the customer you need firework

263
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:43,660
ok net dejan faces cad network and networks it

264
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,670
is me who with figures stall squid

265
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,790
similar stories serves was born a moan

266
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,679
debian two cars  nas that is etcetera and

267
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:57,549
since as you already know the customers

268
00:14:57,549 --> 00:14:59,499
forget the changed passwords they forget

269
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,209
the updates they forget this one

270
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:05,499
forget the other one so my my

271
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:08,439
research was on how I

272
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:11,230
can raise the security level

273
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,100
in the customer's side as much as possible  and having

274
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,920
tested his parmesan linux, he reads rosa that he

275
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,529
already knows that what barbabella

276
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,100
maggiore is also true that a few years

277
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,749
ago the gems sex group was a bit pissed

278
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:31,540
between virg  olette because many

279
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,579
used apparently the patches because using less

280
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,799
worse for the kernel but they did not

281
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:38,579
contribute to the monetary point of view

282
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:43,119
and obviously in short made

283
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:45,670
a policy in which if you are looking for something

284
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,540
we see the stable version otherwise and

285
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,569
I love you must lauper and that varies according to

286
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:55,629
to the best in game and perennial ones and therefore now

287
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:58,540
apart from some political problem of all

288
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,639
the nzomma communities which are some internal disagreement,

289
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,080
however, currently

290
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,510
all the productions that give me jerez sec

291
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,730
I do not have it elsewhere

292
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:13,880
which then is therefore also  take advantage of

293
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,450
some da it becomes very very difficult

294
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,380
because there is a series of precautions

295
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,950
next slide then these are many

296
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,610
cute little things that a jerez sec sciacca

297
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,110
ruta hardening one thing that

298
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,110
struck me is that he currently wants

299
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,740
because we are not already part of those who have  already

300
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,040
an account inside a server in a little

301
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,950
verb makes the best approach to try

302
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,040
to break it was the buffer overflow and

303
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,300
therefore here or prevention for stack

304
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:00,780
overflo  w on 4 mar also for x86 then in

305
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,220
bradic it already has complete protection

306
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,200
for addresses space addresses

307
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,540
or

308
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,690
that is in here all the protections of asl r

309
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,040
I say these acronyms but you know

310
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:23,619
what it means to be able to understand that is

311
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:28,329
these are all maybe someone you  it is

312
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:31,090
more rang someone is a beginner

313
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,030
or does not know what this means

314
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,160
what they are but I can assure you

315
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,240
that they are all a sort of castration

316
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,060
let's say limitations that comes from the kernel

317
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,480
to prevent a program a

318

nu dandy service anything anci  is on

319
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,340
a paranoid level that he can mess

320
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,480
up the system and all these

321
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,310
rear-end figures some of them

322
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,860
are already on the west of say no

323
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,050
the maniacal approach they have for

324
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,820
computer security

325
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,560

335
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,780
that goes to try to create a system

336
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,690
that is as secure as possible and in

337
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,010
any point of view therefore at the

338
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,080
level of services at the level of

339
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,450
processes at level  of all that

340
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,060
one on with well from bern ascas la a

341
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,490
system here you try to prevent it

342
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,070
world that you cannot do more by giving then

343
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,210
rome resigned between apparmor selinus and

344
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,630
jarun sec statistical point of view and

345
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,020
also from research the tests already done

346
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:04,700
dry and the number  1 plasma slide then

347
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,360
for those who do not know what is pax of the

348
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,030
indications so in practice it is all

349
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,119
a sort of

350
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,840
implementation for

351
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,770
which it does not allow to execute

352
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,130
arbitrary code does not allow to do stack

353
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,750
sme smashing

354
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:30,460
over only exploded there is not to

355
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,749
exclude a  through buffer overflow

356
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:36,149
it is not possible to do

357
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,190
strange things with random ip of cod

358
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:50,770
or to use values

359
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,110
to give to adopt something that is

360
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:58,660
in execution  ion and that is currently this

361
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,190
here is the only alternative to start

362
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,960
with a system also to work as a

363
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,240
workstation that there is a good level of

364
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,670
security

365
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,240
ok then if someone was asking yes

366
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,070
ok protection here to protect the

367
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,640
protection on the protection on but also has

368
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,740
view performance

369
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,980
well the good news that no longer affects

370
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,630
so much is quite light and it's not that

371
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,660
we feel all this slowdown to

372
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,930
lose this patch for the kernel then

373
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,930
yes ok talking jack is so nice giving

374
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,640
cool

375
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,050
every now and then we must also make

376
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,410
comparisons what already available

377
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,190
fair futures I made this

378
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,470
selinux schemino in parma gers sec

379
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,410
so as I told you before selinux

380
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,650
and more to use also on relate

381
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,330
word on debian and ubuntu is what they

382
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,480
make me most use reality is based

383
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,560
world of suap armor the nice thing is that

384
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,879
like you  you see the first

385
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:17,129
line that systems viari podestà la on

386
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:18,869
any linux system

387
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:22,590
now novel with the fact of opensuse and suse

388
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,890
by default giada apparmor q  so to go

389
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,809
to parma one thing already tested is to

390
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:29,809
allow if there would not be a thing

391
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:36,450
but jones 7 is what is what

392
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,870
we can give up and it reads the in eni

393
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,220
linux distribution

394
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,380
so it is not pre-installed

395
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,390
anywhere it is something that we are

396
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,460
players  taken tori or if he does

397
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,500
just recompile put the patch

398
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,760
on the kernel

399
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,750
I chose dejan because on debian

400
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,140
testing you can already find it on the repositories the

401
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:05,340
pace then install and restart already sees

402
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,919
the kernel is already facing otherwise

403
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,350
especially the manual work of the patches

404
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,799
to the kernel others  comparison if I still

405
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,020
haven't convinced it because I like

406
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,899
these writings in which one reads no yes but

407
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:22,289
what does this thing do that other

408
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:25,289
then as you can see drs is what there is

409
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:27,870
a futures and one of the things of

410
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,210
elegance that I also god  before it was the

411
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,250
discourse of preventing code

412
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,390
the execution of arbitrary code and

413
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:41,970
what not already selinux and apparmor or me

414
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,090
who cares about computer security

415
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,399
have a prevention for expl  hear shaun

416
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:54,919
kernel and nothing is not so see here

417
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:58,649
this is important this things

418
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:00,890
what they want to use hard

419
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:08,159
from exploded this here a feature that

420
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,630
also knows about caen doping of and then a

421
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,669
hardening discourse at the user

422
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:21,809
land level you have to give mali choose  and that is the

423
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:27,830
biggest problems is this and these two

424
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,120
these here are the items one of the most

425
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,850
important that is considered that is

426
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,549
that in which it goes to talk about hardening bsd I

427
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:38,309
changed linux

428
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:40,049
but if it does not have these protections

429
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:43,530
now someone will be able to say but  because it does not

430
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,490
freeze these protections

431
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,640
because

432
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,190
linus torvalds is putting them

433
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:55,550
slowly is a balance enough means

434
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,380
god been done with kernel 4 conducted

435
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,450
in this some protections will be added

436
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,440
but linux will also appear more

437
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,580
to run open source and

438
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,940
spread linux and concerns the

439
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:17,330
computer security discourse until now it was

440
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,170
only possible to compensate for these gaps with

441
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,350
apparmor selinux mujeres sec

442
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:28,250
now I use it as before both

443
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,270
for ro  uter workstation server and

444
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,400
everything that can only somehow put it

445
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,710
that does not collide with

446
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:43,039
jack I put it to be sure

447
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,080
safe by default as written also on

448
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,840
west of and therefore my invitation is

449
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,080
to peaks makes the system engineer who

450
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,639
both at  I heart the sensitivity and the

451
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:01,340
talk of computer security

452
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,619
I warmly invite you to take it into

453
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:06,169
consideration for your

454
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:09,820
workstation servers because currently it is

455
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,100
the greatest defense we have to

456
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,199
protect a linux system

457
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,670
fortunately open source so I had to

458
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,460
sponsor for that too and

459
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,940
I end up ghost dog with a  famous phrase

460
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,179
of morpheus

461
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:33,370
of the matrix in which this in short that

462
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,660
[Music]

463
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,240
1 can indicate to you the phrase runs

464
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,820
you are you in short, who should

465
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,220
test try to take the way

466
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,870
tomorrow

467
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:52,610
thanks for your attention there is

468
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,480
some question that I will not answer

469
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,540
tell me you have them  created by him a

470
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,510
question a curiosity and you have talked

471
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,620
about protections of the memory slr etcetera

472
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,300
etcetera

473
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,980
in  this case you always talk about

474
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,670
internal space context or you talk about

475
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,040
defense in user le in the sense that what

476
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,950
gives me more to use gr security for

477
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,560
those specific features rather

478
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,510
than using it goes well apart from slr

479
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,060
that is by default in the kernel anyway

480
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,430
always because  the rais myspace that is by

481
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,100
default but what gives me more respect

482
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,890
for example to the position independent and to

483
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,410
all those compilation flags that

484
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,410
already give me of cc and the

485
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:47,150
default inter that there is on all here the approach

486
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:52,220
is more paranoid  to prevent what

487
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,150
kind he invents in the sense that

488
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,570
the use I make of it is what

489
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,880
[Music]

490
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,440
that is an example even for the

491
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,539
layman is that of

492
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,580
the pet I do holding more there it cannot

493
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,690


494
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,180
go I do it aldo so  that for

495
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,250
what kind of inventory more and giving you do not want to

496
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:20,910
do in short

497
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,770
the speech is this I am talking about going to

498
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,600
castrate in some way to limit

499
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,850
anything that the user if good

500
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,790
sells or the program can do

501
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,130
strange things  here is malicious that then I

502
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,630
know them that then I do not know them is a

503
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,000
paranoia monde discourse that is

504
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,310
to limit

505
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,860
what is done both at the user level and at the

506
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,290
level that they have expenses then then passed the

507
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,360
microphone but it was only to search  to

508
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,300
understand in the sense that when I hit

509
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,290
a program

510
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:59,970
yes I said ok but I am the

511
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,960
default nx asl rm space however at the

512
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,520
platform level

513
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,930
I just wanted to understand if there were any

514
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,530
particular differences however it is ok

515
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:13,320
then the one who decides the flag and if

516
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,930
instead its default that one

517
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,430
unless he says differently hero bombilla

518
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,230
as the protections there what you said

519
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,380
before dea slr is something that will do to a

520
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,280
recent brave on linux kernel that is only

521
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:32,790
only that is 2001 2002 I understood however

522
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,210
in the field that is in the  of the path

523
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,370
you are taking into account that in truth

524
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,990
other things and

525
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,210
safety we are incorporating slowly is not

526
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,580
a priority issue as does

527
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,980
little English or other systems to parry

528
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,220
cert  and things here apparmor selinux these

529
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,250
here are additional things to

530
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,300
increase the computer security that

531
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,280
then this is closed slowly geli

532
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,830
we already find some photos on the kernel

533
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:02,640
I only know that by dressing the cypress cypress

534
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,680
because my plan I

535
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,980
will not find myself already a gunner much more

536
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,330
sure compared to the past years i

537
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,520
'm talking about the concepts of informatics

538
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,700
the protections in which the test is welcome

539
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,619
now you will

540
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:19,839
agree with me that if you have something on the

541
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,789
internet or in parma rosa linux talk

542
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:25,929
other things i know if there is a

543
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:27,729
written application forgive me if there is  it is a

544
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:30,039
poorly written application that what you do not know who gives

545
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,349
a pint f I tell you all the track and

546
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:35,229
asl network you insert it I do not know but I

547
00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:36,519
also remember a charge well

548
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,200
we will talk about it in the mythical leave other

549
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,639
questions I remind me that they were what  you

550
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:41,889
said your no which also explained a

551
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:43,659
nice passing these things here years ago

552
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:46,719
two years ago exactly it was only a

553
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:47,349
penalty

554
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:50,019
I remember it in bulk and then look at

555
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:52,989
my wanted self  talk about dagan because I

556
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:55,239
use it and I know it well with jack

557
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:57,940
not as a panacea because you know very well

558
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,200
that in computer security there

559
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,099
is no such thing as that which with it well knows

560
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:03,700


561
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,999
everything and appeared there in parma linux is already

562
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:09,459
dry that they are the only ones  things

563
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:11,679
currently developed that there has a

564
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,039
beautiful community which is the one that we act the

565
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,519
most the bar

566
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:27,609
also because if there are damages of other

567
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:30,339
projects but as you know large

568
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:32,379
well the community arose there is not enough

569
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:34,989
people and they carry it on and then  serena

570
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:45,639
and there is another thing they are doing

571
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:48,219
for which however we currently say

572
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:51,159
that what is more and jerez sec others is

573
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:52,509


574
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:55,659
not the only alternative we have in

575
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:57,639
which it has been developers with mickey that

576
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,999
bans and that us  allows you to raise

577
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:02,919
craftsman is more possible but from me

578
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:04,419
sensitive to the world and to

579
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:06,929
computer security he has disarmed some cabbage and I

580
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:10,029
command because it develops and developed

581
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:14,589
here tell me once installed on the

582
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:16,329
other applications that goes to be installed

583
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:18,369
in the  my euro another south and they

584
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:21,429
shouted resolution we take derby dell

585
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:23,019
era already find them if you have the diane

586
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:24,749
testing and has already find it on rests

587
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:27,159
caiman today installed 10 seacure.it

588
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:28,539
let's say that I stall another

589
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:30,789
program I have to modify some

590
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:34,599
configuration file something or look

591
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:36,389
here I have it

592
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:39,579
if you are referring to programs that I

593
00:31:39,579 --> 00:31:41,049
do not know I have to say that also this

594
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:42,759
program of turning over subgenus

595
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:50,489
security look here that is firefox vlc

596
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,700
flash a rho proprietary notice because the

597
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,360
wifi card is loser it takes  had to

598
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,620
oblige not frino so is the dance and it

599
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,340
ended there

600
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,450
yes yes exact then on i forgot

601
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:12,250
to say that on selinux you can go

602
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,830
don't go avoid 12 in which it can

603
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,740
go to force a thousand for

604
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,010
military specifications is stuff but you can choose the

605
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,380
level  it's almost a kind of piece that

606
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,540
once those protections are put on it is not

607
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,390
that then from it is once that he was fine yes

608
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,950
but this no less check

609
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,610
that man check either there is or  there is not

610
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:38,230
just this in short here are some questions

611
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,720
curiosity however the site is very

612
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,370
exhaustive so you can already find all the

613
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,980
explanations and all that

614
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,679
I have already mentioned I have reported the slides

615
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,179
you can also find them with the description of the

616
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,669
point by point I that  what I wanted

617
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:57,220
was to raise awareness as much as possible of all

618
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,570
these protections to increase

619
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:02,200
computer security it is closed in a

620
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,380
very nice way that from solid 4 4 go and

621
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,070
that go to really block and

622
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,279
most

623
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,690
of the cyber attacks that

624
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,509
use those here linson systems

625
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:20,050
marco ok place  thank you

626
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:24,000
[Applause]
