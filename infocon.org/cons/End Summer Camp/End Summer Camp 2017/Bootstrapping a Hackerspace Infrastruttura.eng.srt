1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,200
my name is the absent i am the person

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,290
with the name it is complicated and with the ic is not

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,769
missing depicted in my non free time i

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,610
am a development between the embedded

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,890
in trieste in my free time i study physics

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,210
when not really entered to do

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,620
and otherwise i do i do the idiot  of the

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,740
village of meter he will put therefore as

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,710
I said before he is what he likes to

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,420
call himself being a hacker space is

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,010
therefore a physical place we have people

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,379
who are quite varied

13
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,379
within us there are physicists there are

14
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,749
chronic apples with him there are also

15
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:47,999
some artists people  who writes

16
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:49,739
conservatory that makes electronic experimental music

17
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:50,839


18
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:53,370
every now and then you hear some very strange soils

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,280
coming from but then in essence there we

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,069
share ideas projects and

21
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:02,370
equipment ideas because we have an

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,680
evening dedicated to chatting and

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,990
so talking about this and that

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,479
exchanging ideas and from there  that

25
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,390
creativity often arises from projects

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,890
because sometimes it is also nice to do something

27
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,259
in short, we talk about it  vast and equipment

28
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,079
are the indispensable things to create

29
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,229
projects so the only

30
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,600
basic problem is that there is a group of people

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,200
who would like to do something together

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,960
so the first problem is

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,880
how to coordinate each other because as long as you are two you are

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,030
called al  phone if already 6 3 the group makes you

35
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,020
on buzz up

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,020
if you are 10 15 it starts to be a

37
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,310
bit complicated to stay

38
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,759
in coordination so in essence there is a

39
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,670
need to communicate that it seems trivial

40
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,280
but it is not so it is not so easy in

41
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,100
truth there is a need to coordinate between the

42
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,950
groups and there is a need to

43
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,990
document that it is something that is very

44
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,700
often forgotten so the first

45
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,250
problem is how to communicate the first

46
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,288
approximation sitting on an

47
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:11,050
English amen and that's what we did but

48
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,720
all  'beginning there was google globe you put yourself

49
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,830
in google blue and that's

50
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:20,900
okay but the mening list I mean has

51
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,940
its pros and cons

52
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,530
so we decided to diversify

53
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,360
our communications a little bit

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,670
because we have  I saw that the mini glee was

55
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,330
used only for official things and many

56
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,580
members were respectful in sending

57
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,160
mails because then the mail arrives at everyone

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,720
I don't want to disturb with my little

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,060
thing with my little problem of the

60
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,980
arduino that does not turn on etc.

61
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,459
etc.

62
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,980
so we decided  to put these

63
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,950
three levels first level is the

64
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,650
[ __ ] level you can say no and beyond the time

65
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,380
[Laughter]

66
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,060
so they are short messages that

67
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,160
if you wake up in the morning and see 200

68
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,579
telegram notifications you realize that

69
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:03,200
maybe you stop because frey moro  during

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,760
the night but in short, even on canvas jumps

71
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,150
no one dies and where there are

72
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,980
also animated gifs where the teacher is

73
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,600
there in the corner then there is level 2 where

74
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,889
the communications

75
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:17,569
should actually be read

76
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,870
so they are official messages

77
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,749
discussions that are a bit  no longer type

78
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:25,730
there is the pin of the hard duino that does not know

79
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,530
what it could be but type or this

80
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,450
design here I would like to try to do

81
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,159
this thing here I can not do it  there is

82
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,019
someone who has tried to do

83
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,329
something like this thing of this type then

84
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:36,700
presentations of new

85
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,400
projects more or less official communications

86
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,510
[Music]

87
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,620
I get pissed off because people don't fix

88
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,159
things like this and then

89
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,560
instead there is  the third level which is

90
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,120
actually the documentation level

91
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,430
so they are things that he knows have been

92
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,870
discussed far and wide

93
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,510
there is nothing to discuss there just to

94
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,159
keep it fixed there as a reminder let's say

95
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,780
or things that are strictly your own

96
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,329
documentation  of projects so

97
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,469
things that are usually not discussed the other

98
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:10,819
problem is that there are too many things to

99
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:14,359
do it was people forget to do things

100
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:17,449
not because they don't want to

101
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:20,209
do them but because it just doesn't come

102
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,550
to your mind then it arrives  the guy who

103
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,860
needs a hand with his ri pie and

104
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,210
you go away from you give him a hand in the

105
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,210
meantime forgot what you are doing

106
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,349
so you need a serious and a system to

107
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:32,750
keep up to date and make head every now and then I

108
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,150
look ad  I know half an hour free

109
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,520
that I can do something useful

110
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,780
so they were basically a place to

111
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,550
mark the things to do to those who do them

112
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,190
by when if they have the deadline not

113
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,530
all have the deadline obviously the

114
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,090
second projection is that in essence you

115
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,440
need  one thing to manage projects

116
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,060
here opens up another world similar to

117
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,650
rp than before because there are

118
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,409
more or less open source systems that are more or

119
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,710
less expensive and I could have another

120
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,479
talk just about why it is not

121
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,400
what we have chosen but in essence

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,620
we need something that is multi-user

123
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,169
because it is good to be able to assign that

124
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,150
someone does something also to then

125
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,050
take him by the collar of for

126
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,190
example you promised to have done

127
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,669
what you did not do is that it is multi-

128
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,590
project so that it can also be

129
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,990
exploited by  from the partners themselves to

130
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,550
manage in a few small projects

131
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,810
the auxiliary problem of all this

132
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,760
thing here is that you start to have a couple

133
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,510
of services around and in short, remember

134
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,130
3 different passwords both people who have

135
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,740
problems with one so let alone 3

136
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,350
so even if you would also have to make

137
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,800
a central application here too another

138
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,710
open world but we need something

139
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,110
simple enough that is

140
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,030
relatively easy to configure

141
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,510
relatively easy to manage

142
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,000
solutions that  funniest part

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,040
then solutions we have tried to

144
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,140
orient ourselves almost exclusively rather

145
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,760
exclusively towards things six places

146
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,890
so if it is we manage it on our

147
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,290
servers so we are not dependent on

148
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,300
other things that could change

149
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,300
over time a usual model that

150
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,220
priests do for free  pay hicks per

151
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,670
month thing like that that they are open

152
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,820
source so that we can modify it

153
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,820
and fix bugs and that they are really

154
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,590
easy to use this is something that

155
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,370
should last but it is not

156
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,720
at all unimportant at all indeed it is very

157
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,420
important fundamental because in the  'acre

158
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,790
space sometimes those who

159
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,640
run the place are used to it  at a

160
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,840
certain level of technique there between yes no the

161
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,450
level of meaning list if I take the

162
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,919
poor artist who deserves a hacker

163
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:52,120
often would like to cut himself to be

164
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,590
something moved but not messages and

165
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,990
emails Milan what he is

166
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,160
talking about

167
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,680
because now the meaning lists  in short

168
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,210
, outside the technical circles there is only

169
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,340
one nor that they are used a lot so

170
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,900
all these solutions must

171
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,130
also be relatively user friendly and

172
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,930
here is the spoiler of all the

173
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,760
solutions we have chosen this is the

174
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,230
answer to the first question if we use

175
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,870
other software  to manage the space

176
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,550
then communication level 1 telegram

177
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,430
ei and

178
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,650
telegram rockets because things must be

179
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,700
user friendly

180
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,380
r yes because there is always the person who

181
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,920
connects irc level 2 and speeches

182
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,560
speech is a platform based aimés

183
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,770
ruby on rails sorry but it is

184
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,890
super cool because it allows you to

185
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,720
use it as a forum and use it as

186
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,510
a user-customizable meling list that is if

187
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,570
the user gramps c  he says to the mila era

188
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,520
chen daming lists this was enough for us

189
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,720
prizes active mini list type of dance

190
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,160
while there is your artist who

191
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,830
would like to have something to click on

192
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,570
that can use the graphic interface of

193
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,760
diverges in short for level 3

194
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,000
level 3 to 16  todo which who is one of the

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,090
standard wikis in short we have chosen from

196
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,440
whom who deserves because it is the one I used

197
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,330
by myself for other problems and therefore he was the

198
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,790
one he knew best for

199
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,410
project management we chose to

200
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,430
use cannes board after a long examination

201
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,590
of conscience because  even there we were not

202
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,810
particularly sure and still we

203
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,490
are not exactly one hundred percent

204
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,980
satisfied with how it works

205
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,450
but in the end it works quite well

206
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,179
then this thing here changes I must say

207
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,580
that it was used that is

208
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,450
still mainly used by the management team

209
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,850
let's say for  therefore coordinating

210
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,670
important things like the day after tomorrow warms us up

211
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,140
and the insurance of the networks and

212
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,420
therefore on how it hurts are messes

213
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,300
g  rossi so this guy in short and they are

214
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,640
all loaded up for the documentation

215
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,800
instead we used both from here that we

216
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,180
usually acted club more south to which

217
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,250
we tend to use only for the codes but

218
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,810
that here we already club an instance

219
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,020
typing our our servers for

220
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,410
instead connecting all things together

221
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,660
we used aime and i say alas

222
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,100
because there is someone who knows the dates

223
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,460
in here the joy of using the dates

224
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,590
well then starting now reviewing

225
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,130
a little more detail instant

226
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,010
messaging the choice was between cameras

227
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,930
there at the end  we managed to do

228
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,830
both telegrams

229
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,130
they all have it basically more or less

230
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,350
it is not like whatsapp but zap not to bots

231
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,150
unfortunately and therefore you cannot make

232
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,470


233
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,060
your neck of telegrams so funny even

234
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,500
open source in backhand it is not open

235
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,720
source so this  it is a bit of

236
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,490
a life to be dependent for a year but for

237
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,680
a third party infrastructure however we have

238
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,880
decided to turn a blind eye to this

239
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,040
thing here because it is effective.  amente it is

240
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,420
much easier than forcing all of the

241
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,740
barriers crc instead bones but it is well

242
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,280
known well run we are frank we are

243
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,990
also on free north and even on the decided

244
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,060
are the bots

245
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,680
the nice thing was when

246
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,440
we found this beautiful bot

247
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,660
that in truth was born  as botti rc

248
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,280
minor evils knows that it is a clone of another

249
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,400
botti rcx on pivot to a

250
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,410
plugin system which is very cool by the way

251
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,350
also this is done in python python and

252
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,120
the somewhat common theme of all our

253
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,250
hackers press has a  management system

254
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,290
for messi that pretty cool in truth

255
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,930
for now it only works on rc but you

256
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,610
can have carthy with the bot

257
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,860
as well as tito act authentic icon with

258
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,930
nick surf of free north to understand us

259
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,030
then to point you with the bot and then

260
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,970
you can give some  commands that have

261
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,800
higher privileges than

262
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,380
the other commands and then we

263
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,730
discovered this plugin which is

264
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,140
immediately called telegram bridges that you can find

265
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,020
on youtube that acts as a bridge between

266
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,510
cameras yes there  we also put a

267
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,340
bit of pure this in order to improve

268
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,680
a bit because now it also supports

269
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,890
multiple groups and multiple channels which is

270
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,350
much better then speeches and

271
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,720
so called mild the pboc we call it

272
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,130
therefore a discussion pole as I

273
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,890
said before ruby on rails fosre  sposi

274
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,730
stoneware you install the installation the

275
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,320
official installation method and

276
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,530
docker which is by the way the

277
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,010
container is made a piece of crap

278
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,330
but unfortunately this is the only way and

279
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,520
the application is the only one of its kind

280
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,020
that is  there are no others for action so

281
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,990
we looked at a little ring this is

282
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,750
the most advanced one

283
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,070
and in the room let's see if I can also

284
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,240
show it to you because we have

285
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,080
opened it back

286
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,130
here it is here how it looks all

287
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,630
these customizable beautiful logo the

288
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,380
colors

289
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,680
here are  no one translated on the internet will

290
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,470
not have it well okay well so

291
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,730
these are all the conversations are

292
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:10,700
sorted by the latest update there

293
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,460
are as you see here indeed co  me maybe you don't

294
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,740
see why too small you can

295
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,750
give something

296
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,340
ok these on these are the various

297
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,870
categories there are categories that

298
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,290
are closed to the public and there

299
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,580
are categories that are also closed

300
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,230
restricted to members for example here there

301
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,240
will fall the  management category who

302
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,230
see it those who are in the management

303
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,470
rightly this what it means this

304
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,690
means that it is actually speech

305
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,050
supports accounts and also supports

306
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,480
groups therefore the group of all

307
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,940
users or the group of south wears or the

308
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,410
group of network employees  external

309
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,940
to the group of employees of the internal network

310
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,060
which are two are two beams cases and I

311
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,530
am the common person to both and

312
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,990
therefore these things are here and it

313
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,870
works and also works with the dap

314
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:09,920
as we have seen that is in the sense you see it

315
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,620
which is a pretty modern application

316
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,320
like look and is also modern to

317
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,700
use

318
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,130
so it is perfect for even for the

319
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,190
person who

320
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,830
is approaching this world for the first time.

321
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,190
able to interact with i

322
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:35,100
will go to an act of foo just

323
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,990
like a wifi network did with

324
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,060
this happens when here it is here here

325
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,600


326
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,250
this for example is the thread that

327
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,080
the object numbers that the members registration

328
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,820
in the members sections for now works

329
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,430
so that we have  a little all the rights

330
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,770
claim and when it exceeds the

331
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,630
goal threshold of the board the person is

332
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,240
approved this is we do it because it

333
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,500
must be done by law technically

334
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,930
out of any approval member must

335
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,220
succeed a report of the board of

336
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,860
directors only that if you have to score the goal

337
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,510
for  everything then we put it

338
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,800
as an addition to our

339
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,930
internal regulation that we can also do it

340
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,210
electronically

341
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,250
so this to show that the

342
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,200
speech also brings paul so it

343
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,150
also supports things that go beyond the

344
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,020
normal mailing list then for example I

345
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,630
don't know events for  events for example

346
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,120
we have a standard inform formula which

347
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,340
is the name of the event, things like the

348
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,040
event when is where the cost p  er

349
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,350
participate who sided with those who do not

350
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,600
participate and public so I can

351
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,550
see who will participate in the trieste

352
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,920
minima che fer and then for example here

353
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,020
we have chosen who it is who goes

354
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,750
as a mild lab to give us a hand at the

355
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,390
stand here you can see who is the  morning that

356
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:56,990
the afternoon

357
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,170
every this ball obviously there is a

358
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,350
username in short, after no this is in

359
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,800
Signora livia and then also the

360
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:14,780
management part this instead the

361
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,270
management panel you can see all

362
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,690
the users and groups

363
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,190
these are the users in fact we

364
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,690
have one

365
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,640
among other things, we have decided as a policy

366
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,920
to leave registration open for

367
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,060
anyone to this thing here so they can

368
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,170
interact mainly because there

369
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,460
are categories that are open to the public

370
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,010
such as the categories of

371
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,200
events and projects and ideas

372
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,000
so anyone can  live your own

373
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,160
project and the discussion sometimes starts

374
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,480
already from the web

375
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,380
back to us to the next on the list è

376
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,730
cambor da al  now this

377
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,560
is a software developed in php never

378
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,470
sequel multi user with multi group

379
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,310
many permissions and multi project like

380
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,550
most of the things you need

381
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,040
to manage the projects is a bit of a mess

382
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,990
because there are the tasks the sub pockets the

383
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,329
project the  gante all these things here

384
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:15,240
so in the sense you can also use it as a

385
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,490
task list now without knowing all

386
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,829
these things here but if you want to make it a little

387
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:21,540
prettier and if the projects a little more

388
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,600
complex it is worth investing that

389
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,490
afternoon for the people how it works a

390
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,310
little  the story the nice thing is that it

391
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,540
also supports integration with

392
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,690
the slavs so i can i can get the

393
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:39,060
club ishida add it like like

394
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,910
like task up on cam board

395
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,889
we see a great cambor of a match

396
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,580
ok this more and cam board this than

397
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,480
mine  dashboard

398
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,880
here are all the projects

399
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,430
that I am part of we have a couple

400
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,260
of meta projects that are for example the

401
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,460
projects related to the management there are the

402
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,470
colors that always very nice  very

403
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,720
nice to have them here you can see the person to

404
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,839
whom the task was assigned obviously

405
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,339
before but also the reminder emails if

406
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,910
someone forgets to do the task

407
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,050
another meta project instead

408
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,640
live events this I must say that he came from

409
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,920
without good so for  the events that

410
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,829
are like one shot we do the evening the

411
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:31,520
evening that knows in parts gpg comes here there

412
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,350
are columns in essence it is

413
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,660
first reached the proposed column then

414
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,490
when the proposal is accepted it

415
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,350
is moved here in programming from

416
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,400
these they can fly android so

417
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,950
I can  move them where I want

418
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,620
is put programming date then however it

419
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,460
contains water is

420
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,220
automatically assigned to the person

421
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,660
responsible for the event group that

422
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,360
were two people

423
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,440
let's say we have chosen but it is

424
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,330
also a bit of policy to

425
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,610
always have a manager a backup yes

426
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,440
I can exceed no so much according to the last one

427
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,400
we have chosen to have a manager

428
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,430
and a backup for any role and qu  then

429
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,130
in short, the teams are always in fact the

430
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,200
two people once the woman is

431
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,280
programmed she is moved to the

432
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,900
organization and when she is

433
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,160
organized she is moved to

434
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,140
advertising advertising is

435
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,670
automatically assigned

436
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,620
media managers which is a post file on facebook and

437
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,410
anything else to try to  to have a

438
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,240
few a few people then a lesson learned

439
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,250
that it is always good to do it

440
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,490
in the end is shifted to the fact this

441
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,860
here is the project let's say the

442
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,570
most complex meta project we have in the

443
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:40,010
system here responsible for projects that

444
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,000
were ruggiero that does not exist today  that he

445
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,780
got his ass like that to configure it well

446
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,870
and then there are more

447
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,700
normal projects we say that we really do

448
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,010
something like this is so

449
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,780
we need to have the people they

450
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,310
collaborate with and everyone has to do their

451
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,140
own thing and when they do it puts it  in

452
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,090
motion in progress panel more over and

453
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,530
this is a standard what is

454
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,570
called kanban board in the way of

455
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,700
project management though  I'm even if you

456
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,950
don't know what you're getting drag she got the

457
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,170
myths degrees it's not that it was

458
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:17,710
great science well the next one and

459
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,210
jazz lab badge I think you

460
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,650
know almost everyone there is someone who

461
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:27,040
doesn't know a club fishing with ok it's a

462
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,230
system  repository management management

463
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,660
however we abuse it because we do

464
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,030
not use only for code but

465
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,920
we are also for hardware projects so

466
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,770
gems that they are still text files

467
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,410
so also quite easy to use them but

468
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,110
one thing I like I like to note

469
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,330
that  we are also for type the minutes and

470
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,390
official documents because it is cool

471
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,430
that is done on purpose in the sense I is the

472
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,080
secretary who prepares the minutes and

473
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,460
puts it as well as this then we

474
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,590
comment on the various lines add

475
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,330
this I judge to the other and after a while the

476
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,420
mashed question is approved and I

477
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,100
sign it I do the mars comit signed

478
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,500
with my c pc and then the shell sun the houses

479
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,270
then also signed with conci pgi

480
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,540
so there is a minimum of control

481
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,980
in short  today everyone looks at it 7 I

482
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,270
don't even show it on media of the

483
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,620
classic from the following face of

484
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,169
documents

485
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:25,320
the point a wiki software based

486
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,980
on ducati

487
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,369
in there there are all the things let's say

488
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:30,480
that what I like to call the

489
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,779
long term memory of  mittel a 20

490
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:37,529
courses projects roles above all and the

491
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:38,759
infrastructure documentation for

492
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,999
example among other things the

493
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:44,220
infrastructure documentation for now is

494
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,169
closed to the public

495
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:50,190
because in short, better not that this

496
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,450
for example is not a page this

497
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,259
as internal infrastructure after we

498
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:57,359
talk about it  maybe a little more to know from the

499
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,749
home page they are the projects instead I

500
00:21:00,749 --> 00:21:03,299
show a project of a girl who has

501
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,119
been a loser this here is a

502
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,399
laser

503
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,230
cut accordion midi laser cut accordion and by

504
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,299
the way it is the most best

505
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,210
documentary project  of the whole meter because there

506
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,539
are also photos many photos petricola

507
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:22,129
are all in the past

508
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:25,470
56 evening to reset the various the various

509
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,369
you  ntatives I underlined the role

510
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:32,730
because in my opinion the roles are

511
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,840
very important within max

512
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,309
payne simply because there are

513
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:40,710
defaults of people responsible for

514
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,590
something in the sense that I get an email

515
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,570
you want to come to this event here I

516
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,220
send her responsible for the events and  from

517
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,409
that point it is out of my mind the more I

518
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,909
deal only if by chance he returns to the

519
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,519
board the roles are also revealed

520
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:56,999
let's say our wikis for now towards

521
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,470
this page find the managers

522
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,350
the associated email address

523
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,539
is a short description of the

524
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:04,739
tasks so to speak so we have

525
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:06,330
media

526
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,039
manager we do not have a web master manager

527
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,289
because no one came forward had

528
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,509
an external internal system engineer a

529
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:13,889
warehouse

530
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:15,840
manager a head of procurement

531
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,470
that are snacks and drinks responsible for

532
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,820
events courses in social projects

533
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:25,799
this is what we have seen is the

534
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,770
thing that

535
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,090
that works which is not something that

536
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:35,360
works well enough coming back  to us

537
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,770
the last part the

538
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,590
publication unfortunately the publication is something to be

539
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,450
carried out with the necessary precautions

540
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,560
because in short, if only because if

541
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,760
you do not make a fool of the

542
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,520
peach cris and detached

543
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,020
we have chosen to use the dap for

544
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,010
now it is all quite family

545
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,560
one of the problems going forward is how

546
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,710
do you change the passwords of users

547
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,110
or students forget the password

548
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,570
how the [ __ ] do you recover it this thing

549
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,030
here was solved when for pure hard

550
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,350
blow of ass I found this is the dap

551
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,230
toolbox project that I am a  group of

552
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,280
users who have created this this

553
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,770
mini mini site in php that allows you to

554
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,060
recover your password

555
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,900
the main usual link to the poker team annals

556
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,100
by email submit the password

557
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,840
allows you to change it comfort makes these

558
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,520
two cases between duke that these two things

559
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,800
it's good for now, no problems

560
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,450
now, the service so you don't know how to

561
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,680
send web e-mails that I don't remember

562
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,180
before my password things like this

563
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,380
[Music]

564
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,300
the hardware on which this whole

565
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,690
thing runs here are a small vps of the steal

566
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,600
from one euro a month that keeps us on the

567
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,230
bot

568
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,740
the dap in a dedicated machine that is a

569
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,550
bit more expensive for now is a lot

570
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,020
even a little too much

571
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,950
is underused  who keeps us on the two

572
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,700
applications

573
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,640
the two ruby applications this one here

574
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,790
we pay 20 euros a month and then

575
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,870
we have a hosting service

576
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,210
sponsored by a friend of mine in Trieste

577
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,310
who keeps us on the parts that are phpm

578
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,050
sequel in essence then the website

579
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:22,740
that html  pure lips whose kits ask for

580
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,330
hope which is self service in the

581
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,280
future this thing here I had to

582
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,100
resize it because there is your proof

583
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,440
in the future we think about immigrating all the

584
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,840
african publication which is a

585
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,540
very very cool software even a little bit  more

586
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,650
messed up because it is based on kerberos

587
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,140
and or aut 2 then with another with another

588
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,260
software and this maybe this is very

589
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,120
nice but I have to think about it a bit about

590
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,210
that a bit complex we are making a

591
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,890
new website for  because what is

592
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,910
now on is actually a

593
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,610
temporary website because we discovered that

594
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,620
they had at the head of the provider that

595
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,540
kept us the main site was

596
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,960
distributing malware on every eu rel

597
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,710
but it was not our fault we

598
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,270
would like to do a we would like to pull

599
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,190
for  iron this on a mq tt broker

600
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:17,550
to keep the state of the acre space

601
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,530
then to easily see if the

602
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,150
sla that was open closed because now

603
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,640
we use a manual method that when you

604
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,680
arrive at the space write open to our

605
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,150
box and our box ib remembers that the

606
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,100
open, however, you usually forget to

607
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,020
write close and therefore we were

608
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,889
not open forever

609
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,360
then we would like to improve the bot a little

610
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,690
so do the query

611
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,730
of the status vi m.it here there is already a

612
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,670
plugin for the  sloth that you all do with me

613
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,160
so it would be enough to add a bit of

614
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,750
code to get out the data you

615
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,730
need and I'd like to

616
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,530
tempt users that happens via

617
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,950
rc also via telegram with the use of

618
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,720
telegr  am and the other the other soft from too

619
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,640
one hundred software a little more daring because

620
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,230
there is no self-service panel

621
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,410
for

622
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,360
managing membership so that

623
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,280
members can also register via the

624
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,800


625
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,590
internet  their data obviously speaks with triton

626
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,200
has merged into created metrically

627
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,360
the user and anything else ok well then me in

628
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,420
truth or even a very short two or three

629
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,570
slides concerning the internal infrastructure

630
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,840
instead all the reserves of pisa

631
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,450
9 are internal but it goes and  if you are

632
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,830
tired we can also not do

633
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,800
it we do it tomorrow so I do not know if

634
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,560
you want I can also go

635
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,100
on as regards the organization

636
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,720
ahead as trains

637
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,570
I see tired people but then we

638
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,890
started from this this was

639
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,600
when we were still in the

640
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,020
old stars there was  the router, a switch, an

641
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,570
access point, an IP phone and two

642
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:03,100
computers, and this was all that was needed,

643
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,780
in short, because, for better or for worse, each to

644
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,520
their own laptop, so it is

645
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,170
not that  is that you are our big

646
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,560
machines

647
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,940
then we chose to do something

648
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,100
that was a personal choice in

649
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,900
truth of me and of the other people who take

650
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,720
care of it because we like the end in the sense

651
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,370
the infrastructure for us is also a game

652
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,860
in the sense is  beautiful because the partners use it

653
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,200
for me but also [ __ ] because the game

654
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,850
with things with with the

655
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,250
children's toys is great so we

656
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,960
have received we have received a couple of

657
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,550


658
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,360
shares that we have taken on a router microtec nice dahlak a couple two managers  swiss is

659
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,150
a nose a little more a little more serious a little bit

660
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,490
of extra computer and therefore it has become

661
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,240
these things and therefore which not only do

662
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,800
not read very well but here is

663
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,540
our main router which is called

664
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,800
cechov

665
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,220
then there is  one switch for one room is

666
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,930
another smith manager for the other

667
00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:01,960
room there are like 9 different networks

668
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,870
your wlan there is the network for the

669
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,020
wifi point the network for the sis point wifi

670
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,580
guests there is the network for the sis  point wifi

671
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,500
internet of things that we overcome  body

672
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,260
firewall to such nastiness there are a

673
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,580
couple of machines there are a few

674
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,860
ip phones we decided to be

675
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,899
cool and have internal asterisks server

676
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,549
then we have the cisl accentra dinner

677
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:23,549
that answers when he calls Milan

678
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:25,510
lets the phone ring a couple of times

679
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,070
then  you aim the call

680
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,909
less we have pulled out an

681
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,429
arac server which is very rich consumes a

682
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:34,960
[ __ ] power but in short it keeps on

683
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,850
a subscriber basis no aids box which is

684
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,399
also a very nice software and

685
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:40,779
allows you to map all the

686
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:42,789
ip addresses these are things to  sting

687
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:46,539
systems are budding systems engineers like me we have

688
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:48,520
two wi fi check points with the controller

689
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,200
so we have the list also wanting to

690
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,630
encrypt the list of all

691
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,640
connected devices then another

692
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,409
of the options precisely and just see

693
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:57,640
if there are two or more  devices

694
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,830
connected to the network from the can be more

695
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,539
likely kalac and thick open and then

696
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,090
do a specific test with these things

697
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,860
here you can do

698
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,750
it can be done we took a couple of

699
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:12,159
normal 2d printers because often

700
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,789
you have to print things too and therefore

701
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,440
this has become a bit

702
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,409
of my and the other's playground or the girl

703
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:21,580
's playground even if with an internal fracture

704
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,500
then now we are playing with frit and

705
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,200
with  another software called

706
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,899
kobler space work that allows you

707
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:30,279
to automatically provision the

708
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:32,380
machines take the machine a computer

709
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,460
attacks the network he boots from tftp he

710
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,080
already knows the mac address of that machine

711
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,700
because if you didn't understand the added

712
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,580
she added  the group is then makes you start

713
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,380
from the right distribution with the

714
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,210
right software with arduino type

715
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,039
pre-installed the software of his

716
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:51,789
pre-installed lot if you change

717
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:55,330
machine for half an hour also because he

718
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,440
pays attention to me because we have the gigabit network

719
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,210
that superior put it gigabit network  and

720
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,470
so now we have this list of

721
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,770
active services

722
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,800
we already have in a2 that our

723
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,110
our nas on which it runs in is fess

724
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,080
soundbite that q  ui we have interprise

725
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,420
that our main server that a pixel

726
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:18,620
studies network vpn and triton spits that

727
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,200
in the head now with tripe there is a

728
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,030
small bulldozer and zero that will say furniture that

729
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,030
manages the speaker audio system

730
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,180
and then there is the main rude  which

731
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,650
also manages the ndp

732
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:34,100
in the future i would like to put migrate

733
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,620
everything on fripp to use many

734
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,500
cazione pupia 2 enterprise on wifi add

735
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,060
a couple of pudong

736
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,590
minder services that an

737
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:47,380
open source surveillance system the one in red that the

738
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,820
next project that will need to

739
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,380
finish as soon as possible that the opening

740
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,270
of the space via smart card especially

741
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,130
because we want to do it well we are already a

742
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,850
good point but its getting under and

743
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,350
then the other cute design is a

744
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:09,260
layer 120 small gps noren spy with the

745
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,420
gps receiver that pps signal  which

746
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:16,070
acts as the true source of the time of the hour

747
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,370
in substance and this and how much you

748
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:23,660
obtained for half an hour

749
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,040
if there are questions but not all together

750
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,159
for

751
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:37,389
I don't know if there is  then I do not know if it

752
00:31:37,389 --> 00:31:40,149
has nothing to do with it now we understand it is

753
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:43,419
very clear as long as you are already started a

754
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:46,630
reality I believe that it will not be built in a

755
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,169
short time but that you risk two years more

756
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:54,429
or less but in how much time you dedicate a

757
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:57,070
day and above all to find

758
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,200
space for the whole part  administrative of

759
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,220
how as a value that seems to me a thing

760
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,620
is an excellent question then we started

761
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:11,049
and in truth also thanks to a few

762
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:16,269
people who are the same we started

763
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:17,759
as a group of ten people then

764
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:19,779
there are things called

765
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:21,730
design patterns  italia 3 spaces that are

766
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,559
nothing more than

767
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:27,250
vademecum-like rules to create a hacker space that

768
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,399
can live is one of these rules that it

769
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,679
is always very important to keep in mind

770
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:34,379
the two plus two rule

771
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:36,879
so to start one

772
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:38,980
there must often be two  people willing to

773
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,600
devote a good chunk of their

774
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,899
time to nurture this new

775
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:46,360
creature and two people who lend a

776
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,659
hand when they can when they can so we

777
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:52,830
deserve  assimo started with ten people

778
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,840
of which in truth there was one who

779
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,669
was willing to devote most

780
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:59,950
of his free time to make it

781
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,440
grow and others like some more or less

782
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,149
in short so the whole ambaradan

783
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:09,040
started from there there is  also to say that

784
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,830
I already had previous experiences

785
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,480
also create spies because this here is

786
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,240
the second that was created the first was

787
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,530
an experiment that lasted a year and a half

788
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,970
and then after and I finished time I

789
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,920
started this here

790
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,470
the other one is  concluded there is one

791
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,220
thing

792
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,990
to say at the beginning of we left for rent

793
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,980
the rent is something that weighs

794
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:39,000
heavily because for example in Trieste

795
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,250
poor hole that we had is

796
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,070
still pay 500 euros a month and it is something

797
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,950
that obliges you  doing endless courses

798
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,110
also puts you in a situation a bit

799
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:54,040
like that because legally because more

800
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,980
technically it is not a bit shadi as an

801
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,330
association doing this type of thing

802
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,310
we were actually lucky to

803
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,860
find the right connection that was the

804
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,750
Banca di te kb of trieste that was

805
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,668
just when we are trying to

806
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:15,130
move somewhere else

807
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:18,429
was opening a co-working space of

808
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:22,210
the senator of companies we are taking

809
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,918
risks and convince them and they gave us

810
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,770
I do not move of the two offices and therefore

811
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,840
we settled ii  and now

812
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,090
precisely because we have been freed from the

813
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,489
burden of having to continually take courses and

814
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,889
continually look for ways to come

815
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,860
up with discriminating rent money we

816
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,389
have been freer to do things like

817
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:43,929
this unfortunately this is the reality

818
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:46,300
beyond v a place that you sponsor

819
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,000
if not you have to find a lot of people

820
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,010
because the model exists the model

821
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,199
works in the sense if you go to monaco there

822
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,560
are 50 people 100 people who give 20

823
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,300
euros a month well with that money you

824
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,900
can make a reasoning of the in

825
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,870
trieste not  there are so many people and

826
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,290
therefore either you survive like this or you don't

827
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,400
survive

828
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,170
this unfortunately is the reality in the sense

829
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,440
unfortunately we were lucky that is

830
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,579
lucky  to we were lucky but it must

831
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,400
also be said that in short, places placed at

832
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,490
off for symbolic rent you can find them if nothing

833
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,359
else than the common thing of the genre

834
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:46,470
so I think I have answered in short I

835
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,700
tried to stay at the politicaly correct

836
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:53,039
traversi short arm negative in

837
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,690
this  here and spiritual places to understand

838
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,099
the cows that the business model is

839
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:57,809
more solid that of the fab lab than that

840
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:00,390
of the spent hips yes yes yes yes well the

841
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,500
business model from a point of

842
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,599
view obviously much more solid also

843
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,079
because the fabs

844
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,730
are not  hardly ever an association I have

845
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,049
always been pure companies the

846
00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:13,380
business model in the sense however I am not here

847
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,130
to do business

848
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,529
and that is the fundamental thing

849
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:20,039
in my opinion I at a casper I go there because

850
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,960
I like it no because I want to get the

851
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,440
money out I don't  I see nothing if you are a

852
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,000
fab lab obviously you enjoy fisb ater to

853
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,509
prepare customers however the factors for

854
00:36:30,509 --> 00:36:32,400
laser cuts put two machines at your

855
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,200
disposal print admit of a

856
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,279
payment  or even if you are a fab lab penco

857
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,319
the service, in any case, to make races the

858
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:41,910
service to the citizenship if instead it

859
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,710
seems that at the expense of the fields only if

860
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,420
there is someone who finances you no that

861
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,250
city there if it does not find a financier

862
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,380
no more expenses are born  it does nothing,

863
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,900
that is, if the choice is also expenses or nothing

864
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,660
but also space paid for by someone else,

865
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:00,130
a fab lab is better in truth in the sense

866
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,260
with the fab lab surely if you find people

867
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,290
who are bumped into being there to make

868
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,260
it a job it is certainly much

869
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,260
more livable  however in the sense, while the

870
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,700
fab lab is just a commercial model

871
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,840
, hackers often tend

872
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,850
to be more social

873
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:25,480
perhaps or in the sense not strictly

874
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,270
made for commercial purposes for pure

875
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,860
fun which I like much more

876
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,150
but it is a  choice in sex is a

877
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,930
personal 71 two very anti alpin of

878
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,020
financial fun paid for by others

879
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,230
is fun paid in part by

880
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,360
others but not exclusive

881
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:58,279
to apologize in an ido seen auction  that you are

882
00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:00,709
abandoning in the uk to use another

883
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:01,429
program

884
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:04,489
yes and I'm interested

885
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:05,749
here is ours if we have seen the top

886
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:09,650
previous to this node I'm sorry there we were

887
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,849
talking about this new

888
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:12,469
program that would replace

889
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:14,959
cash the less voyeur squeeze no in

890
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,799
essence  we talk about triton which is a

891
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:21,140
super 7 of lucas in while uk serves to

892
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,539
manage only the financial part

893
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:24,679
between the con manages both the

894
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,059
financial part and also the part of partners

895
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:36,039
for example other questions

896
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,300
well if you don't find me around or the

897
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:46,570
