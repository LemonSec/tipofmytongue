1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,710
so hello everyone good evening i am

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,450
daniele gobetti i am one of the core

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,440
developers of the gadget bridge project that i

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,910
will explain to you at the end what it is because

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,079
i am not here to tell you about the

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,910
project but i am here to tell you about

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,450
what happened to us because like so

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,730
many  open source projects

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,480
we had and still have an

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,080
immediate presence that we use both as a

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,290
repository for the code and as the

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,760
tracker and as a wiki this summer in

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,949
June an unpleasant thing happened

14
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:44,280
and we learned so many things to

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,809
solve this unpleasant thing that

16
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,260
it happened to us and this is what I would

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,569
like to tell you about how important it is to

18
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:53,370
raise awareness of what

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,979
are positive things but also negative things

20
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:57,870
and risks that are run by

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,690
having a project right away let's

22
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,479
start with the positive things I don't think I

23
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,880
have to explain to anyone  here

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,420
what is life is a platform where you are

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,969
basically guaranteed to

26
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:14,089
have

27
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,950
[Music]

28
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,680
to have a very broad visibility here

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,410
esto is a page of our project

30
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,890
as you can see we have just over 1,500

31
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,460
stars several hundred forks and

32
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,380
several hundred people who

33
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:35,980
look at us

34
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,260
while rich and clash raw what

35
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,720
are closed issues that are opened

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,850
in shows that are closed so we are

37
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,920
a small project  which was born in 2015,

38
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,210
however, the skis from and gave us the

39
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,880
opportunity to have a nice community

40
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,700
around the project, something that

41
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,720
you do when you open an account on a diet

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,400
but in particular when you then go to

43
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,979
upload some code and of course

44
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:04,840
accept  the terms and conditions of

45
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,830
service among these highlighted one

46
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,560
that says that you basically agree

47
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,420
to resolve any legal issues or

48
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,970
diatribes in a competent court

49
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,459
which is a US court in california

50
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:23,280
that where its registered office prohibited

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,100
therefore substantially any

52
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,560
European citizen

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,350
the project a  gadget says composed of

54
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,350
three duel cores for I'm

55
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,930
obviously Italian and two guys from

56
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,530
berlin  therefore three European citizens who,

57
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,600
having a project undergone, agree to

58
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,100
submit to what is

59
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,870
American legislation with all the

60
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,230
consequences of the case

61
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,360
among these consequences there is the fact that

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,040
in the United States there is a digital

63
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,980
millennium copyright act that

64
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,220
substantially allows and  I say this in

65
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,830
all honesty in a very correct way to

66
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,220
kitab to disavow the content that is

67
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,080
what happens if I upload the

68
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,570
Sunni content I can do it with a

69
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,110


70
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,850
substantially anonymous account I can

71
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,610
register it with a disposable email and

72
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,360
then I can upload anything

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,620
on which  I have no intellectual right

74
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,540


75
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,819
so they very transparently

76
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,439
and describe the steps

77
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,709
for a person or a company that believes that

78
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:36,989
its intellectual property has been violated

79
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:39,000
to say that

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,329
code that content is mine and has

81
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,739
no right  to stay there you have to

82
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,540
take it out on the basis of US law,

83
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,989
since life is what it

84
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,340
provides  makes available the

85
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,299
contents for the end user and the tabs

86
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,129
who are responsible for this thing so

87
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,689
if I upload a film shot immediately

88
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:03,389
someone downloads it from guitar and get up

89
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:05,250
who is responsible for

90
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,169
making this content available which

91
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:09,720
should not be  available

92
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,139
the exception is that a

93
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:15,810
content provider must have a procedure that

94
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,430
allows anyone to say that

95
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,899
content mine you have to remove it at

96
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,810
that point they rightly repeat they

97
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,780
remove it close it until the person

98
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,389
who uploaded it  he will take

99
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,009
responsibility in the first person say no

100
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,240
that there is mine

101
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,740
I put it because I had the right to

102
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,530
do it today the white and the

103
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,280
take down notes is the procedure by which

104
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,840
the holder of the alleged or the self-styled

105
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,639
owner of intellectual property

106
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,289
rights  he can ask for time to

107
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:48,900
hide a content he does it by listing

108
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,150
a series of wars l this is ours

109
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,990
the case an office that has closed

110
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,880
our reposit  ory at the beginning of June

111
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,210


112
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,870
as you can see the listed surrenders are

113
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,090
uld show her up for those who do not

114
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,190
know about diet are typically created by

115
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,659
other users who can

116
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:11,310
say something is not working for me do

117
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,500
this do me that or I suggest to

118
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,210
make this change to  improve the

119
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,330
functioning of the application in these

120
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,159
shows some users had

121
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:21,750
uploaded screenshots of another

122
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,550
application screenshot an

123
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,169
android application made that functionality of the

124
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:27,389
system I take the screenshot and load it

125
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:28,340
here

126
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,790
the person who opened this

127
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,949
technotise said these screenshots

128
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:38,720
cannot  be shared in addition

129
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,760
someone had sent logs anyway

130
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,830
taken from the system with the

131
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,979
data transmission between the application and wearable

132
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,130
devices said these things

133
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,380
cannot be done consequently dear life

134
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,870
you have to remove these contents

135
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,600
in my opinion in this case kit having done

136
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,669
a  error because in case the

137
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:05,770
listed contents are the on then

138
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,560
contents  generated not by the managers

139
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,990
of the repository but by other users you

140
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,460
should in case you have to retaliate on these

141
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,229
other users not on those responsible for the

142
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:18,609
positive questions at the end

143
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,410
sorry for it because its related to

144
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,380
this as in the sla and I see that

145
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,140
at the beginning there is the

146
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,730
repository empire  I just wanted to know if the

147
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,970
communication was made by giving that too,

148
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,750
that is not only her on but also

149
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,370
the entire repository because if it was

150
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,640
this probably since they

151
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,430
communicated an entire repository then

152
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:58,610
google of abb had to is exactly

153
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,520
what happened in fact the  point is

154
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,290
that then in the textual part of

155
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,210
description of this tech from a notes

156
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,890
in reality the references were purely

157
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,290
alescio so in my opinion here the tabs

158
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,430
made a mistake or at least did not

159
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,290
analyze

160
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,550
accurately I was expecting it notes because I

161
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,470
suspect but  the person who did

162
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,270
this does not answer us we

163
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,010
tried to contact him no I

164
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,540
suspect that he was there c  on clay

165
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,000
solver for the copy paste and it

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,800
remained there when he did in via the

167
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,010
forum but we will never know

168
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,470
so what happens when the company blocks

169
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,460
a repository on the depository page

170
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,590
this repository appears this repository is not

171
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,030
available due to one of them

172
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,590
the things to know as I told

173
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,630
you you have heard I am talking very little about

174
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,240
the project because I want to explain

175
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,470
what happens because it is important

176
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,830
for other projects in my opinion here is

177
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,350
about public access

178
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,360
here is public access a horn because we

179
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,790
are authenticated while passing

180
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,790
from ep to pur  they will not be able to access to

181
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,650
deposit so in reality even for

182
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,050
those who own the repository

183
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,520
reposition is completely

184
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,010
inaccessible composer means who

185
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,400
means wiki means serious projects

186
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,800
used naturally also means the

187
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,320
code as regards the

188
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,390
remote repository that if we want the

189
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,520
minor problem because  each developer has their

190
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,220
own code and their local copy of the

191
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,750
code  so that is the

192
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,679
minor problem so first first important lesson

193
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,000


194
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,950
beckham if you use kits for your

195
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,979
project made becca we did not

196
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,270
have the code of course

197
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,920
each for us and I said okay to the

198
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,089
code is that the important thing

199
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:50,680
when the 5 600 in show on the  repositories

200
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,350
are also important

201
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,540
so if you get to the crown notice

202
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,060
what to do if you don't have beckham

203
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,300
the first thing go to the

204
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,750
czech public cash on the cdm there are google there

205
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,900
are many and take screenshots of

206
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,130
what has been reported because it

207
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,770
still reports  the pages with the different for l

208
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,350
as existing but with a status quo 3 4

209
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,080
5 1 that different for which within two

210
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,790
three days from the public coffers these

211
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,820
are and consequently rooted

212
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,100
as for example in our case if we

213
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,230
had gone to trial

214
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,780
we would have had to defend ourselves on the

215
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,690
basis of things that were no longer

216
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,089
accessible to have a copy is

217
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:39,709
definitely useful when I went

218
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:41,330
to talk to a lawyer that for q  hen I

219
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,100
can be competent on the subject

220
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,020
of the violation of your

221
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,950
project they know nothing probably

222
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,180
establish roles we were three and

223
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,730
we immediately agreed to say

224
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,190
ok I do this you do what you

225
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,620
do this because above all in an

226
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,930
open source project  it is easy not to have the

227
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,850
reality of the roles schematized everyone does

228
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,170
a little what in this situation

229
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,390
you have to really go into the

230
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,980
match against mode and one must know what to do

231
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,320
if you have contacts there all of us

232
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,089
in the end we are lucky enough to find

233
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:15,050


234
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,180
a lawyer through a  the fact that

235
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,740
I had already talked to him for the

236
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,269
linux user group of which I was

237
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:22,550
president but he really

238
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,080
talked about that software nation europe

239
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,720
we entered the sex

240
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,930
conservancy chats I know do everything what not to do

241
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,940
because it only wastes time trying to

242
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,800
get around the blocks  I try from the

243
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,110
api I try here I try there when the tab is

244
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,240
closed is closed then maybe there are

245
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,529
more people c  ompetent of us who

246
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:42,290
manage to act for us we were not

247
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,060
able to

248
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,980
write to the life support to say but

249
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,930
there was a mistake in our opinion this

250
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,760
thing should not be done and we did it

251
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,640
we did it several in all more

252
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,500
than ten people  of our users to

253
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,769
say you were wrong in this case

254
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:59,360
receiving the standard answer that says

255
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,980
the repository is closed because there is a

256
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,899
case a notes you have to do the camper notes

257
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,970
point that is the only star it makes no

258
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,820
sense to try to do anything else after me

259
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,190
stupidly I tried to contact on

260
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,209
twitter the guy who made us

261
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:13,220
close by saying if the powers tell us to

262
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,079
remove the screenshots instead of

263
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:17,450
writing to heaven

264
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,529
and he but blocked but not even

265
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:24,560
answered so it is not very useful in

266
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,000
a few days just because

267
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,560
we have  having experienced all the contacts we

268
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,230
had we ended up on files of and that is

269
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,750
a fairly important newspaper a

270
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,060
website then they are the ones who publish

271
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,790
ct if you know it, that is, among etcetera

272
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,459
aida  written about the fact that it is another

273
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,800
good reason not to use ghizzardi

274
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,950
in short there was a bit of movement

275
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,480
luckily at the beginning I tell you the truth

276
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,339
we had said listen you know that there is we

277
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:50,779
do it for fun we do not

278
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,160
earn anything this  he wanted to

279
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,610
break up and oh well let's let

280
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,640
the bad man win and amen

281
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,050
when we saw that instead there was

282
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,250
some support from the community

283
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,890
we decided to proceed with a

284
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,940
noctis account

285
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,810
even here when we do in the

286
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,250
meantime we already actually had a

287
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,260
repository  private git however

288
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,150
somewhere else to exchange things

289
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,920
reports a timeline of events today

290
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,690
I did this I wrote that the

291
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,280
other one answered me about all very

292
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,320
useful things because then after weeks

293
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,600
you have to retrace what makes finding

294
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,220
a legal piston is  fundamental because in

295
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,980
any case I believe that giving the first

296
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,170
signal that is given is this answer both

297
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,540
gift and who has made who knows who

298
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,890
made the report

299
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,800
if the answer is comp  etente and you can see

300
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,510
that there is a lawyer behind it in my opinion

301
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,060
on the other side it is perceived as ok

302
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,330
here if we go ahead there is someone over there

303
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,760
who knows his job not one who says

304
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,220
yes no but we did not want to excuse us etc.

305
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,670


306
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,230
etc. mine  advice is to find a lawyer

307
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,110
anyway and then in any case

308
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,430
we have sketched the technical part of the answer.

309
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,600


310
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,520


311
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,190


312
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,350


313
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,300


314
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,760
it is right and so on of

315
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,860
course when you do this thing if they

316
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,420
have to accept some things as mentioned

317
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,340
you have to accept to submit

318
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,490
to the jurisdiction 26 this

319
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,900
reality is already accepted when you create

320
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,330
the account but it is easy to forget it here it

321
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,540
is very pressing because it  he makes himself

322
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,580
his own and you have to accept to

323
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,940
face some expenses for him he is tied

324
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,190
leader what he is then he prepares it he

325
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,100
is sent via web it up he takes it

326
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,020
easy within a few moments  and day a

327
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,570
week etc. he lets you know if the

328
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,070
thing you sent is acceptable

329
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,230
or not if he says it is not acceptable

330
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,720
he returns to the first step otherwise he

331
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,670
says ok we have received everything is fine

332
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,260
we publish it

333
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,210
and at this point who made the

334
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,100
initial report to  10

335
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,290
working days to initiate a legal action

336
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,510
against you

337
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,839
for this I say you accept the

338
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,690
jurisdiction 26 because here really is you you

339
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,330
say this code is mine and from all and from

340
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,310
all rights to make it stand there

341
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,720
accepting the fact that the other person

342
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,340
can take you to court

343
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,820
in the united states if after 10 days of

344
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,950
tav does not receive news from the court that

345
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,270
the legal action has been initiated and

346
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,890
file

347
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,260
the anatomy of a counter nothing is opened very briefly it is

348
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,400
precisely that one assumes

349
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,570
responsibility for that  that has been

350
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,450
published so you have to add the

351
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,490
contact details of at least one of

352
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,760
the king's charges so 3 and in the canton otis

353
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,100
there is the technical side that is why

354
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,690
technically what was said

355
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,480
in the night is not correct and of

356
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,250
course the legal footings that

357
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,990
say for example sharing screenshots

358
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,170
is not against ems and sharing

359
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,290
logs the logs are not copyright so it

360
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:03,270
is not a violation of the dst tricks then

361
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,650
prohibited in his life he says  very

362
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,570
explicitly if you make an account for

363
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,970
notes and you want to keep your privacy

364
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,670
there is no problem instead of putting

365
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,100
your name and having the lawyer sign it

366
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,630
here we did it and after a

367
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,310
week we get the answer that

368
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,200
says iron the name  of union

369
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,280
we lost a week do not submit

370
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,240
it via web

371
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,400
we did your mission via web you

372
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,010
receive them the nice confirmation

373
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,070
of the sending that was successful no one

374
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,570
has heard from after four

375
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,890
days this we did at

376
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,780
the beginning the lawyer  he redid the mail via e-mail

377
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,180
and within a few hours he had received

378
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,750
the confirmation at least that the e-mail had

379
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,300
been received something else the re

380
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,190
position is reopened s  Without notice

381
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,260
this is important above all because

382
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,370
if you have said you have agreed to

383
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,050
remove content from the repository

384
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,850
then obviously you have to do it in

385
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,440
our case we said yes to these

386
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,550
screenshots we do not care

387
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,440
so we delete these islands as well, obviously

388
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,480
there is no problem

389
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,500
in the  the moment the repository

390
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,970
is reopened, those contents are

391
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,240
still there and therefore it is appropriate to keep it

392
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,720
under control to avoid exposing yourself

393
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,400
again to leaving there some content that

394
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,900
you have agreed to remove which

395
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,230
however remains visual instead we

396
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,580
realized that it was reopened  obviously

397
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,260
you know there are these ten days that

398
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,330
they say but in reality

399
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,160
then maybe the holiday is involved this

400
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,170
that other but they dressed the province of

401
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,120
washington but not in short I

402
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,430
advise you from the ninth day have a lunch

403
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,890
that sees being positive is  back in

404
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,760
case

405
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,310
you react immediately, however, prevention is

406
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,230
better than cure

407
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,570
then there is a distributed system as

408
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,070
mentioned i  The code has never been a

409
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,840
problem in our case the code

410
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,850
we each had it on his bed every

411
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,340
force had it but there are also

412
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,940
tools 1 and packaged debian vita back

413
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,120
up tests that works very well

414
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,310
you run it from your  repository from

415
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,990
your local copy of the re position he

416
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,060
creates a brand called getafe he pulls

417
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,119
in that through pii dei jason that

418
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,339
describe all the iso all the things

419
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,280
for which that works very well

420
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,349
obviously you don't have the graphic aspect

421
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,930
but at least the textual contents and

422
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,300
who wrote them and so on cilea verde the

423
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,040
wiki of a tav project is a

424
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,020
separate git repository so that

425
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,359
you can keep a local clone and keep it

426
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,920
updated and I recommend it because there

427
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,020
too in our case there was so much

428
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,200
knowledge that would have been lost

429
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,210
open from the channels in addition to tap

430
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,130
before it happens us practically

431
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,110
our dialogue with users

432
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,700
our contact with users years has

433
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,650
only through kit before s  killed

434
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,330
all this now if you see in the slide

435
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,200
at the bottom right

436
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,730
we have a blog we have given domains

437
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,110
lies there we had but we weren't

438
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,970
using them because so much 10 massive company

439
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,420
but yes there is more so I advise you

440
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,210
before it happens there has been a

441
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,260
question then or more minutes

442
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:09,360
I advise you to do this thing and

443
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,890
keep in mind that it can happen to

444
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,130
you too that is we are three Europeans a

445
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,110
European developer has closed

446
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,000
repository for giving itself an

447
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,810
American law that is really with the fact that

448
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,470
you can be called for reason  for

449
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,060
the closure for the detection of the

450
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,640
cocker and I do not want to say that there will be a

451
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,530
bad actor who opens an issue and

452
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,750
puts you in the disney film and

453
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,340
then says close them positively but it

454
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,730
could happen firmly

455
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,800
all this you can find on our blog

456
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,360
we did  a post where we

457
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,950
tried to explain why I think

458
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,110
this is very important and for

459
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,730
anyone who has a project on twitter

460
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,220
I would really like you to be  be aware

461
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,970
of this if you have time left over and

462
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,670
a starlet fits, I appreciate it also

463
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,200
because with two thousand stars and then

464
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,820
we can have a poster instance of

465
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,270
speeches open another channel to

466
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,530
reach our times you can

467
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,630
install us on fv we accept liberations

468
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,900
on donations on liberate i  26 but why

469
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,430
who will have to install the roads if I don't know

470
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,910
what you do gange bridge non-application

471
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:18,990
for android which is released with

472
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,000
gpl license 3 supports different wearable devices

473
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,670
smartwatch of pebble mi band lamazzi at

474
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,920
t which is quite new and we

475
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,440
already have support the old  sony live

476
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,480
view

477
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,890
the application does not have permission for the

478
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,590
internet so your data you do

479
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,030
not even want to look in the code that we do not

480
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,320
send anywhere because

481
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,090
physically as well as saving them on the

482
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,600
device we can not do

483
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,120
and allows you to use your

484
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,040
device war without having to create  an

485
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,870
account on the different platforms without

486
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,660
sending them the data is obviously doing

487
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,400
that  that we know how to do them and therefore

488
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,929
if you give us a hand to make them do

489
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:01,260
beautiful things, I am very happy,

490
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,450
finally, only a small thing on the day

491
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,670
in December of last year that

492
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,150
the bankruptcy of for

493
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,230
the acquisition by the filters of the

494
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,850
intellectual property for a few hours

495
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,800
we were in the overall trending repositories

496
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,300
on guitar of all languages

497
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,610
down at the bottom we were third last but

498
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,550
on the first page and so we are

499
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,860
proud of it and I show it thanks precisely

500
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:33,860
[Applause]

501
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:39,139
[Music]

502
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,790
sorry talk about providing you  of a US lawyer yes

503
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:50,920
of a US lawyer

504
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,540
no an Italian lawyer we are fortunate

505
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,390
to have had in fact personally

506
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,100
had contact in the past with Carlo

507
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,050
Piana that perhaps some of you know

508
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,400
who collaborates with what software

509
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,270
foundation europe and is a

510
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,300
competent person in the matter who has allowed

511
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,650
to give us a hand substantially not a

512
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,630
US lawyer because

513
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,540
fortunately in the first instance so that

514
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,280
they do not call you in  judgment with the

515
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,050
US courts you do not have to have

516
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,820
anything to do luckily but

517
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,280
you agree to assume this

518
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,170
responsibility in front of a door and the

519
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,170
US in case you arrived at the

520
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,390
court he could represent you in

521
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,990
an American court

522
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,650
this yes obviously there would have been

523
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:44,240
different expenses different  order of

524
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,250
magnitude and now if you are curious to

525
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,240
know who is

526
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,130
the application or the developer who

527
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,570
made us the case a notes you can

528
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,430
see it on the kitab site because they are all

529
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,630
public

530
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,930
but let's say that it is an application is

531
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,020
available for sale on the play store

532
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,430
from  numbers that are on place for a

533
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,070
between 100 thousand and 500 thousand installations

534
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,470
and two euros and 99 are on sale so

535
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,440
let's say that I leave the accounts to you but

536
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,020
the economic resources were slightly

537
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,620
unbalanced our disadvantage

538
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,429
22 things beyond the fact that carlo il  my

539
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,370
study colleague so I am glad

540
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,780
I am glad that

541
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,540
one just born is mentioned but I wanted to do he

542
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,130
authorized me  or to mention his name

543
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,700


544
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,820
a consideration related to your no you asked him

545
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,279
which is not to try to

546
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,169
contact on twitter here I wanted to

547
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:46,820
add a detail

548
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,210
in these cases it is very important that he

549
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,480
write illegal and not the part because if

550
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,360
you write something that  goes against us

551
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,059
and very often even just saying come on it

552
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:00,950
escaped us we are sorry we

553
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,210
remedy that then in case of judgment

554
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,559
becomes a proof against us instead

555
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,870
what the lawyer writes is in any

556
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,730
case just not binding or in

557
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,289
general does not bind the party are

558
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:14,120
expressly  therefore said the

559
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,250
attempt not to contact if not to inform them

560
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,049
important also for this I just wanted to

561
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:20,059
add thanks

562
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:22,399
if this was precisely the reaction

563
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:25,309
I think it is natural to be on

564
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:28,340
