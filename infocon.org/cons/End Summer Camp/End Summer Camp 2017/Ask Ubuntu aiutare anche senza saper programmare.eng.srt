1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:11,260
concluded to all decided this top is

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,709
dedicated to a tour that is an

3
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:18,740
online community of people who use point is

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,810
that they help each other in

5
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,580
solving problems or answer

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,800
questions

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,480
so the title precisely helps even

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,550
without knowing how to program because you can

9
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,050
be part  from communities or

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,970
free software and you can also lend a hand to

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,110
other people and contribute to the

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,520
spread of free software without also

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,550
being able to program for

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,230
the son many other things you can

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,290
work on in the wiki documentation to

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,780
translations and also to help the

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,410
users for those who were not with rafa i am

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,470
andrea i work as a developer and i am

19
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,360
part of the astri butoh community and

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,540
also italy

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,150
then what is the problem of people

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,860
who find themselves having to solve a

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,050
problem these people usually

24
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,660
look for maybe on the internet a  solution

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,430
or in any case they need the answers

26
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,250
and there are the usual difficulties and that will

27
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,659
be conquered as soon as possible  do

28
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,030
first maybe you find

29
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,270
old information then the solution is hidden

30
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,400
but it was valid for a

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,890
version of ubuntu seven years ago and

32
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,090
therefore I do not need it or there are

33
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,000
many forums where one said the

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,920
solution you find it here and puts you the

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,640
link of

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,960
course  as soon as I go to click the

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,760
link I discover that the site is no longer online

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,530
in 2000

39
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,190
at which point I am again screwed

40
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,799
because I do not find the solution of

41
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,420
course there are those who then in the evening maybe

42
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,570
on pairs of web archive archives

43
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,930
etc. but they are not always found

44
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,790
or another problem that is

45
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,259
found both in the communities and in the

46
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,780
forums is that basically people

47
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,758
waste time chatting about everything

48
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,310
more so I use the forum to talk about the

49
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,440
problem but also about other things or

50
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,290
lose 45 messages to ask for a

51
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,750
clarification to change a  command

52
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,030
etc. and then there is a lot

53
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,010
of background noise which becomes difficult at that

54
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,100
point to follow the passage from the problem

55
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,330
to the solution everything that  there

56
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,010
was in the middle

57
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,600
if I am looking for an answer it is not that I am

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,269
very interested in reading the affairs

59
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,610
of all the members of the forum I am

60
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,810
interested in the solution and

61
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,760
the rest is relatively less important

62
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,709
and then clearly there are some cases of

63
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,920
community in which it always happens  the guy

64
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,820
the guys who have to give a solution

65
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,900
so it is not important if what they

66
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,400
say makes sense the important thing that they

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,750
always intervene so that the

68
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,260
partner

69
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,850
all start solutions that do not

70
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,799
make logical sense

71
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,450
I do not know if I had ever happened to put it in but

72
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,000
I also think  to you that maybe one surfs

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,620
on a site reads a guy who has a

74
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,930
problem is when you see another who

75
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,390
answers him do this do that you put

76
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,120
your hands in your hair and think but

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,030
what is the point of this thing does not make sense from the

78
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,380
point of view  technical does not make sense

79
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,579
maybe even from a grammatical point of view he

80
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,410
is just someone who had to say

81
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,590
something to say but not to contribute

82
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,180
just because he had to be the protagonist

83
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,820
then in that case there is b  I need

84
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,769
other people maybe I point out that

85
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:34,900
the solution was not correct and so much

86
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,280
because this presentation was

87
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,010
originally proposed to the community

88
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,350
conference italy we have taken as an

89
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,720
example the facebook group of un punto

90
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,030
italia that offers us some examples of

91
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,140
errors or problems that

92
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,239
can be  be for example this

93
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,840
person started a post to

94
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,170
ask something but the problem is that

95
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,170
the introduction is for three quarters

96
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,239
various anecdotes his yes I am happy with a point

97
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,489
that is nice that is bla bla bla yes but what

98
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:09,050
is your problem  then he got to the point

99
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,780
and in that image you can see that

100
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,370
the problem underlined in

101
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,530
orange is only one and a half lines

102
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,769
from all that was

103
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,108
the introduction and then maybe if also

104
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:23,240
another question which is relatively more

105
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,100
generic tutorial type  or

106
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,740
else that's okay we are not here for

107
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,240
this

108
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,690
if your problem is the wifi we solve

109
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,340
the wifi problem in the meantime then the

110
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,210
rest is done later  then what were

111
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,860
the solutions proposed by the people

112
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,960
per hour of course the first is to search the

113
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,520
internet with the name of the blog model

114
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,370
the ace ok if the user is not really an

115
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,930
idiot probably the sea did if he

116
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,389
came to ask why he did not  found

117
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,550
then maybe re-arranged is not the

118
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,850
most useful thing in the world then comes the

119
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,590
guy who complains because the

120
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,180
wifi drivers don't work

121
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,680
or it takes too long too much

122
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,240
time to update etc.

123
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,130
this too is absolutely

124
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,160
useless finally someone arrives  who

125
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,380
proposes a suggestion and link

126
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,960
coincidentally at a discount no indeed this is the

127
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,430
Italian version that is of ubuntu it

128
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,410
however it is the operation is practically the same

129
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,919
and then another person

130
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,240
proposes to install a package and

131
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,340
therefore this is useful that is at least try

132
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,750
to give an answer

133
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,340
and then of course the phenomenon

134
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,539
I was talking about before that absolutely must

135
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,850
intervene there said to increase the ram

136
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,530
because it is evident that if you want  i fi does not

137
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,169
work putting 4 gb of ram more

138
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:34,729
magically the driver wants to

139
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:39,950
work and then other things that I

140
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,110
am not which together because they are

141
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,380
delusions but the point is that in all

142
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,930
this there are many messages that

143
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,789
are useless and  some message that

144
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:51,680
tries to help but the problem is that

145
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,500
who will go to be then the whole is not

146
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,360
able to distinguish or

147
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,950
cannot easily distinguish why he

148
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,990
should read everything before deciding

149
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,139
what is

150
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,909
normal we see another example always

151
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:09,300
relative to the same post  a

152
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,219
person asks him to run a

153
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:13,020
diagnostic command and then to

154
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,770
bring the is fine this makes sense

155
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,749
then the first user gets to say

156
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:21,360
that he solved it but of course he will never tell

157
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,610
how he solved it because they are the

158
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,469
secret classes of  state no first I ask for

159
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,169
help then I solve and I have to wait until

160
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,789
there is the one below that apologizes

161
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:30,900
but on the eye the problem is not that

162
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,610
you could tell me maybe how she laughed

163
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,860
lto so I solve it too no you

164
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,629
had to wait for someone to ask you

165
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,770
obviously if this is the

166
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,539
absolute definitive scourge of the

167
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,430
facebook group of ubuntu italy those fixed

168
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,680
with the ps those according to which all the

169
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,330
problems in the world including war

170
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,830
world hunger etc. yes  they solve

171
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,219
using lts versions of ubuntu and who does not

172
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:55,409
use lts is an imbecile so much that

173
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:58,770
sometimes they say good have fun you have not

174
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,979
put your business in the ps good

175
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:03,240
this is the attitude of some

176
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,810
people who are convinced by their

177
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,889
very high preparation that they have read

178
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:09,779
linux  mac both once the

179
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:12,270
lts version solves all the problems in the world

180
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,189
it is not exactly like this they

181
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:17,370
are things a little more complex than these

182
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,849
but some do so and then the anecdote

183
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:22,409
like it took me so many months to

184
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,149
solve on my old laptop

185
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,939
from the ages  and then boh I don't know

186
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:31,979
but he wrote it ok next example

187
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,680
luckily many many parts of the question

188
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,360
are actually the question so

189
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,520
not  there are many anecdotes and

190
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,370
various criticisms but a small detail this

191
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,779
person forgot to write

192
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:43,830
what the model of the sound card is

193
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,789
so he has a problem with the

194
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:49,649
sound card point ok but knowing the model

195
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:51,719
would be useful because if he told me the

196
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,520
model maybe he will give you a  hand then

197
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,779
surely someone will have asked him

198
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,689
how more a message no obviously uses

199
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:00,779
linux mint you know a problem that point

200
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,580
uses mind this is the other the other

201
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,949
version of those of the use lts this

202
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,180
and even changes distro because

203
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,789
the attitude of some is  use mint

204
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,669
anyway the rubber of the car has formed me

205
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,780
use minutes

206
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,729
and yet so that is some have this

207
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,690
attitude here and their contributions

208
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,040
are colored the same way that

209
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,389
same source etcetera and all the others

210
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:25,280
so one has to read all the posts

211
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,720
to understand what the place is  useful from

212
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,410
the less useful

213
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,240
here it is again lts if one uses a

214
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,309
semi-annual then I would say that he should not

215
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:36,799
complain and under ok you are right

216
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,690
d  always alert the same person

217
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,210
twice, this too is not a

218
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,130
useful attitude to anyone

219
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,110
first because if not to give a

220
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,550
solution at least one suggestion

221
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,950
shut up what you do first that is or if you want

222
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,020
me to create you take him to a post to

223
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,089


224
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:54,140
finally chat someone  he asks for a

225
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,529
clarification use it 16 02

226
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,600
this was our friend from before 4

227
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,029
gb of ram senses 02 only he uses it

228
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:03,440
because it does not

229
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,750
exist attention or mint

230
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:13,100
clearly here and then we can

231
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,450
summarize the problems felt by

232
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,820
facebook how difficult it is  categorize

233
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,770
the questions because facebook groups

234
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,420
are not made to ask for technical support

235
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,190
so you cannot divide for example the

236
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,180
questions on the ram on the kernel the questions

237
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,760
on the graphical interface it is not possible to

238
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,830
differentiate them then it is not clear if the

239
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,510
problem is solved because the post on

240
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,890
facebook  with one year the box that I

241
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,570
wrote solved and therefore it is difficult

242
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,390
even that it is difficult to format

243
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,220
also the  I want to see you copy

244
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,140
the terminal output into facebook and

245
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,510
hope it is readable it's all

246
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,540
written in a san serif font so you

247
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,150
can't practically read it there are a

248
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,650
lot of duplicates there too because

249
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,990
people have a hard time looking for the

250
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,400
question made it was asked why

251
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,500
facebook  it is not made for that it is

252
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,330
not even so much people's fault the

253
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,640
duplicate thing only that the duplicates

254
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,430
are hard to find and of course

255
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,310
there are considering me mint trolls the

256
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,910
aids ones usual stuff

257
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,320
so facebook is not

258
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,590
the most suitable platform to do  I help

259
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,940
technical support for people who

260
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,280
use ubuntu as well as any other

261
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,680
distribution would not be suitable because

262
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,970
it is not made for that facebook is a

263
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,470
social network and is used to chat to

264
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,630
post photos of cats and to share

265
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,920
news files enough well then let's see the

266
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,380
forum

267
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,520
this is the  international ubuntu forum

268
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,010
and you see that the problem

269
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,350
is that sentence written in orange over there

270
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,790
that  is the title of fred

271
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,000
very well and to give the solution that it is

272
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,560
an error with the package manager

273
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,930
there are practically nine pages

274
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,550
containing 37 messages of which

275
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,870
surely someone would have asked

276
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,670
him please place at the point of this

277
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,430
command and the other replied ok  done and

278
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,200
then on so finally that in the end

279
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,970
the solution did not come and then someone

280
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,820
else started chatting

281
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,720
this too is sometimes a bit uncomfortable and

282
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,940
I say this as an administrator of an

283
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,770
example forum but sometimes the forums are

284
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,590
the most  suitable for solving technical problems

285
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,010
depends on the type of question

286
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,960
then for these for all these

287
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,270
problems to solve these problems

288
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,440
the ascom community was born, which

289
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,680
is actually part of another larger one

290
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,450
because it is part of a network

291
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,080
called stai crescenza  and the story very

292
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,990
briefly is that in 2008 a

293
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,060
website called stack overflow was born which is

294
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,010
used for programming questions

295
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,189


296
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,030
then in 2010 the managers  of stack overflow

297
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,450
have decided to extend a network of

298
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,440
sites that are now 166 but you can

299
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,650
propose others that deal with

300
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,180
various communities

301
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,920
the important thing is that the children have

302
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,020
a specific purpose for you for example there is a

303
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,060
community that talks about  ubuntu is precisely

304
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,460
ascom dot there is a community that talks

305
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,490
about mac there is one that talks about android one

306
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,440
that talks about gardening

307
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,240
that is each community has a

308
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,820
specific purpose and the people who participate in

309
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,120
the community agree to participate

310
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,529
and help each other  However, without going off topic

311
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,720
without writing about topics that do not

312
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,120
concern today ascom I aim at

313
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,720
over 260,000 questions over

314
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,589
340,000 answers and 430,000 users practically

315
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,699
so it is obviously a community

316
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,709
of international level

317
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:52,069
that is spreading well,

318
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:54,800
among other things, if there is  it happens to

319
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,579
google problems with ubuntu

320
00:12:58,579 --> 00:12:59,870
if you search in English anyway an

321
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,309
error message etc. one of the

322
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:02,779
first results certainly on the  the

323
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:06,379
listening in most cases and and

324
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,180
you can enter and read the answers of

325
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,499
course there is no need to

326
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:11,240
register just to damage you can

327
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,160
read what you need

328
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,990
if you want to participate you can create an

329
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,689
account and contribute to the site

330
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:21,459
now let's see how it works and why it is

331
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:25,629
more comfortable in some ways more

332
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:27,829
functional than a forum

333
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:29,209
certainly compared to a

334
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:33,589
facebook group then the problem of before that

335
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:35,449
that person had with the

336
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:37,309
package managers on ascob a tool this is

337
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,290
the whole page with all the questions

338
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,430
the question and all the  answers

339
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,870
there is a question that is cut

340
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,670
so they are not rigid categories

341
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,559
for that question it could end up on

342
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,329
multiple categories and detailed and

343
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:54,889
a description is simply posed to a supporter

344
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:56,629
that can be formatted if you

345
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:59,449
need to add codes etc and

346
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:02,809
then people start answering  and if

347
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,000
needed but rarely leave some

348
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,559
comments which however could

349
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,569
be cleaned up at any time  if they

350
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:11,540
become obsolete or or become too

351
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,370
chatty the comments are swept away it

352
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,350


353
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,200
is practically imperative that all the posts that are

354
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,580
posted as answers are

355
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,870
actually answers because

356
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,480
otherwise they screw the moderators

357
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,230
or if you have some experience

358
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,970
you can also

359
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,430
capsulate directly the answers that do not

360
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,200
are that they are not actually

361
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,780
answered as even the questions that are

362
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,610
duplicated are closed as

363
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,350
duplicates soon let's see how it works so

364
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,190
compared to the nine pages 87

365
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,680
messages before for the same problem its

366
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,980
discount comes out a page what is

367
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,450
this is also what  people

368
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,940
appreciate it because it saves time without

369
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,880
reading all the chatter or all the

370
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,520
things if I have to ask the person to

371
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,710
modify to add the out of a

372
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,460
command it is not that the person replies to me by

373
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,200
throwing back under the command car but

374
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,090
simply modifies the question

375
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,770
initial integrating the information

376
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,110
then the  question is getting better and

377
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,660
better is the content of the question comes

378
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,370
a level that is very precise very

379
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,030
clear and well paid because then

380
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,180
these posts are within certain limits

381
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,980
that can also be modified by others so it

382
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,930
becomes a sort of wiki if I see that

383
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,550
one has written a  question but not the

384
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,400
form nanny the unreadable code I make

385
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,110
two clicks select the code I tell him

386
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,020
this is a code the formatting

387
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,220
suddenly improves and this

388
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,050
requires little effort from everyone

389
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,290
so it is a distributed effort this

390
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,330
if it is made possible thanks to the

391
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:49,940
reputation the tank was  practically

392
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,250
when I enter the community it starts with

393
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,220
a profile that has a point a simple

394
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,830
point unless I have already been

395
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,560
registered on stack overflow on another

396
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,480
site in the network and have a

397
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,310
positive reputation then I am given 100

398
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,030
bonus points when placed  a question

399
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,940
every time someone puts a

400
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,910
positive vote then an arrow up I

401
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,430
earn 5 points if it is a  in

402
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,590
response each up arrow becomes 10

403
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,860
points while both a question and a

404
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,380
negative answer and therefore that they

405
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,680
said a

406
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,110
bad vote make me lose two points

407
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,460
this in the meantime allows you to have the

408
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,930
possibility to order the answers

409
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:34,910
invaded the score

410
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,140
so if there are two answers  to the

411
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,080
same question the one that at 89 points is

412
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,910
above the one that has four to say

413
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,200
and therefore whoever reads the page

414
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,640
tends to read the

415
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,850
most voted answers first and then there is also

416
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,980
the possibility of accepting the answers

417
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,200
so who did  the question may

418
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,870
decide to put a big

419
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,110
green checkmark on the side of the question that

420
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,120
to the answer that he found most

421
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,220
useful for his problem he asked himself I

422
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,240
see the big checkmark at that point I know

423
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,609
that most likely with the solution

424
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,109
that also applies to me

425
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,369
and therefore I save myself from reading the

426
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:18,510
others and I can also filter the questions

427
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,220
to see those that have had

428
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,290
an acceptance

429
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,559
here is the fact  to have a score

430
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,890
is not only to say ah how nice today

431
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,620
or 10 points more but in reality

432
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,280
it also allows you to distribute the

433
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,110
possibility to all users to

434
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,140
participate in moderation, curation

435
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,330
of contents, modification of

436
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,840
contents

437
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,029
and other actions that may require  a

438
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:50,230
certain reliability then we solve the

439
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,080
problem that for example wikipedia for

440
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,940
which people on wikipedia can

441
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,850
modify consequently many

442
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,409
intelligent people arrive and want to

443
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:01,029
make a contribution some

444
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:03,309
imbecile arrives who writes nonsense and which

445
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:04,990
means that it takes other people

446
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,210
to always check the changes

447
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,700
eventually they bring them back

448
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,529
on the other hand a completely

449
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:15,330
closed wiki and it becomes useless practically

450
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,270
it is not even nice instead this is a

451
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:27,659
useful trade off because it allows you to

452
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:31,240
practically control what

453
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,200
people write so if you have for

454
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,270
example 500 points you can proceed to the

455
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,240
things to say video content if it at 3000

456
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,490
can v  otare to close a question is

457
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,740
so on

458
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,149
the contents can be screwed on

459
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:51,100
depending on the reputation can be

460
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,899
screwed vote for closure for various

461
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,490
reasons off topic and / or duplicate

462
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,110
especially duplicate it is important to

463
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,679
close the questions that are duplicates

464
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,480
so participation is reduced to

465
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,409
making a  question that is research first

466
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,610
then clearly specify the goal

467
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,010
is to avoid superfluous information

468
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,539
I would like to show above all this

469
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:13,179
share and jones kit who is a famous user

470
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:15,820
that is, write the question better

471
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,039
until you can read it and think that if

472
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,510
only he knew the answer it would be  a

473
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,399
pleasure to provide it

474
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:23,080
at that point then the right time to

475
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,610
post the question is to wait for the

476
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,000
answers not so

477
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,470
these are the classic posts that are

478
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,370
closed after 30 seconds like a jaen ideal

479
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,559
pur gent clijsters monette mi which by

480
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,040
the way was a duplicate of a

481
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,830
so naturally the phenomenon here

482
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,140
could look for something else and would have already had the

483
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,150
answer even before writing  and all

484
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,090
in capital letters that title there and post

485
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,960
and waste time let's say to the moderators

486
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,720
then of course to give the answers it is

487
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,860
appropriate that the institutions are

488
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,170
clear that they are certain no eh but try to

489
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,850
do so maybe it works because that

490
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,010
was not willing and a comment

491
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,720
and  you must mention the sources reported and

492
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,510
format well when the time comes

493
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:11,210
you can moderate and I point out the one that

494
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,230
has another sentence that you find in the

495
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,260
ascom documentation point that the

496
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,420
managers have clearly written we

497
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,400
do not manage this site it is the community

498
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,230
that manages it

499
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,040
so this  from a responsibility it

500
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,230
is also one of the possibilities for the

501
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,300
people who participate therefore to be

502
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,750
intelligent and to bring positive contributions

503
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:38,000
so to conclude

504
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,280
ask questions write the answer is

505
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,240
yes it has it if you know and when you

506
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,340
reach a certain amount of

507
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,320
score you can  access to

508
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,720
moderation different tools depending

509
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,910
on the score is especially important

510
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,210
with  check the posts of new users

511
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,110
possibly vote to close the

512
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,060
questions that are inappropriate or that

513
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,950
are mice that have for example separate of

514
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,140
mind or other distributions that

515
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,630
are not a good tour or if they are duplicates and

516
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,070
finally enjoy the quality content

517
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,110
because that is  the final goal of

518
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,720
ascom I point well if you have any

519
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,910
questions it is 16 23 15 still some

520
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,030
time

521
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,600
the announcement point usually and I am tied

522
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,950
to other people's slackware is however sometimes

523
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,169
it is the conditions for which I have to

524
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,299
use point and sometimes I have tried  this

525
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:40,090
community extremely effective the

526
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,270
engine behind the cycle management and

527
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,860
open source available

528
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,480
no but there are others similar for

529
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,240
example the italian version of ubuntu

530
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,030
italy which is ask point point between pino

531
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,049
it.org use I think it is oe schio air

532
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:01,690
or the new version that has another

533
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,860
name that I do not remember that has been

534
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,370
forced that works practically the

535
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,860
same way sta games is a sort of

536
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,130
site a bit like bl  Ogger

537
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,260
that is you register and create your

538
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,380
community as you who blog

539
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,840
using a social network platform

540
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,490
practically so it is not a software

541
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,679
that is installed on your server but

542
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,230
you enter the network and use it

543
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,730
and applying for a

544
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,220
community  community is tested is in beta

545
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,530
testing for a certain amount of time with

546
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,990
controlled users and then it is created and

547
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,360
this is a listening as it was created there

548
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,799
are however some free software that

549
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:45,130
simulate this behavior sky that

550
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,990
comes to mind now there are a couple

551
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,390
of others who frankly do not remember the

552
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,500
name but there are at least 23 question

553
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,559
was basically who is behind it is

554
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,190
growing is a company that does the

555
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,490
job

556
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:09,380
yes the communities have some not all

557
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,510
in reality but some have bans

558
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,230
simply that then  among other things

559
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,700
they have clearly written associated with the

560
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,000
and bloggers do not care so much they

561
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,160
do not change so much so you can surf

562
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,690
safely with led blogger at  tivo you

563
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,090
do not see anything you see only how, however,

564
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,070
the banners put them quite

565
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,900
non-invasively then stack overflow there is the

566
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,090
whole part of jobs which therefore attracts

567
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,250
a lot of people because companies

568
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,900
post us job offers for

569
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,360
software developers and therefore  everyone

570
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,230
goes to see if there are offers so

571
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,660
that already was a lot of others remains

572
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,410
all mainly

573
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,960
are other questions it

574
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,950
is a moment that arrigoni rock

575
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,930
a little bit all of the distributions

576
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,900
and I am very happy to buy the

577
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,640
monthly which is made of a

578
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,790
easy face and that there has helped me a lot

579
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,540
to be autonomous compared to other

580
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,190
distributions that otherwise or I

581
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,740
have to wait a year to ask something

582
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,510
about you plan or other and

583
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,290
institutions in short

584
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,279
and there are other questions if not I leave you

585
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:42,000
the engine okay thanks  everyone

586
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,269
[Applause]
