1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,440
ok hi everyone then I'll tell you about

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,429
my undergraduate quite interesting you don't

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,200
see who knows what technical stuff but

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,049
the idea is nice as a type and it is the

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,630
realization of a boot system via

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,250
bittorrent then the goal of the thesis

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,760
was to understand well how  it works

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,760
if bittorrent and to apply it to an

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,130
unusual context i.e. to the

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,930
boot context of a relatively complex network

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,340
which are relatively complex here for

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,870
some it could mean thousands of

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,290
machines

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,430
in our case to say 124 machines

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,730
our context is a bit particular

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,840
university of milan  in the

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,879
computer science department

18
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:52,590
we have three classrooms that we often and

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,420
willingly have to reconfigure especially in

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,640
the exam house in the case of exams

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,770
we make a particular boot with a

22
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,170
very limited distribution very

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,049
customized because it is obviously to

24
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,939
prevent people from copying

25
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,650
each other  tasks or things like that

26
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,640


27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,170
are usually dual boot machines

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,630
year windows unfortunately  o default and

29
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,420
normal linux when we do the exams

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,700
must throw a very chaste version

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,570
of linux

32
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,580
the current problem is that in the

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,250
left side that is the current version and it

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,110
is not yet this version that is

35
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,909
telling is not yet in production and

36
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,920
maybe it will not be  never but after I tell you

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,520
why of the current people the

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,970
switch from one context to another costs if

39
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,770
one wants to do it on all 124

40
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,110
machines about half an hour because because

41
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,119
unfortunately the server and one the

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,490
bottleneck is a network with four

43
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,460
ethernet with 4 100 megabits in parallel

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,530
and therefore good or bad it must serve

45
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,920
something like 500 megs to every single

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,020
machine on the network so unfortunately the

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,439
servers sit and it is half an hour the

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,540
boot of all the machines obviously if

49
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,068
one has to schedule an exam in  queue to the

50
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:08,788
other

51
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:11,099
as often the machines

52
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,780
there contexts that have to be loaded

53
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,560
are

54
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,690
lost between an exam between one session

55
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,730
and another we have to let us spend at least

56
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,190
half an hour there  except for problems

57
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,450
the idea was precisely to hypothesize

58
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,980
the use of bit torrent to

59
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,040
boot and then switch from a situation

60
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,200
to star star from a situation to

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,599
graph the this is the for the

62
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,580
current procedure as is

63
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,170
currently the case

64
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,060
the  single machines throw

65
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,489
in pixels or rather when they do not have to

66
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,069
throw normally they throw from disk

67
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,440
there is therefore during the exams they throw

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,410
through the peak and load a uniterre of

69
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,099
large ok they throw it in the ram and then they

70
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,260
start normally as there they start

71
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,450
turning completely rancet all the

72
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,319
whole  filesystem to ram these two areas that

73
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,000
you see red are the two areas of

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,190
intervention he has on which

75
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,970
david and davide bruschi worked, that is,

76
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,570
both the download part and the boot part,

77
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,579
let's say the problem the two

78
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:27,180
problems are the part of  download

79
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,680
there is transfer of the file that

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,310
is currently done with tftp and is

81
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,739
precisely with the network graph in

82
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,670
star and not and not in graph and

83
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,140
decompress  essione dell'inghiterra of

84
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,970
decompression of the lines of which is not

85
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,420
cheap this a few minutes

86
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,500
david what he did first first

87
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,450
step of intervention very simple

88
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,519
simply think of a different type

89
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,859
of compression done a bit of tests

90
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:57,000
so this has changed

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,190
absolutely nothing substantially of the

92
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,319
of all the architecture he only said

93
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,480
let's try to see the various

94
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,850
compression algorithms there are some more

95
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,350
efficient than others also

96
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,319
particularly in function of

97
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:12,660
the hardware used which unfortunately is

98
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,069
very old we are universities without

99
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:15,989
money like practically all the roads

100
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,250
in Italy  except the private ones perhaps for

101
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,550
which he simply changed the great

102
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,470
but compression and with that

103
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,010
gained a few minutes

104
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,680
on the boot time so both because

105
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,660
the file is reduced yes no perhaps

106
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,710
slightly enlarged the file used

107
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,420
at the end of the fair gizip yes ok  so

108
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,450
that was the first surgery done

109
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,290
the second surgery was that of

110
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,000
exploit at this point bittorrent

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,460
then as I imagine some of you

112
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,220
will know then oh well I'll go back I do not have it

113
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,170
rightly instead when when one

114
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,400
looks for a slide and never finds it as

115
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,920
someone on bittorrent what is it that

116
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,950
makes the idea of bittorrent  it is sensible instead

117
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,870
that having a server that serves the data to

118
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,480
everyone every client that downloads

119
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,430
some type of information from the server

120
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,320
in turn acts as a server for someone

121
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,370
else,

122
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,250
therefore switching from a normal

123
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,350
protocol to a bittorrent type protocol

124
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,780
allows the fact to have  a network in

125
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,500
which the individual nodes act as servers for

126
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
other nodes and that is to insert themselves

127
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,160
somewhere to change and replace

128
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,030
completely or almost completely the tftp and switch

129
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,440
to something different

130
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,820
in reality I say completely or almost

131
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,740
because the typical tf and again obviously

132
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,890
because because the  solution foresees the

133
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,240
fact that started ftp a

134
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,100
small operating system is downloaded an asl in

135
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,640
this case a super super

136
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,070
laced sled that is torn of any

137
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,670
what is not needed are a dozen 13 mag

138
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,910
a of stuff the sled spar

139
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,190
tesla sled is downloaded if exactly how

140
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,510
the original system would have started before

141
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,340
then throwing in ram

142
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,990
the only thing that leaves apart from

143
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,230
a shell is a bittorrent

144
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,310
client the client  BitTorrent starts by hooking up

145
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,830
to the tracker that on the server that

146
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,100
same server that previously served all the

147
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,550
machines now becomes both a server and a

148
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,420
tracker and therefore individual nodes

149
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,860
when they have started the

150
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,460
itas become clients and

151
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,009
then they also become servers in

152
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,590
turn obviously has  at the end of

153
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,550
everything that is when the original file that is

154
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,259
what was initially done via

155
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:53,630
tftp is now done with bittorrent when it

156
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,580
is loaded in its entirety

157
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,099
you can decide to start it then

158
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:01,370
to obtain the final situation ex ante

159
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,530
through for example that and sec

160
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,669
ok that then  however, it actually throws and

161
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:11,360
throws the server during the

162
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,580
final desired operating system the thousands

163
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,870
of lines of co  says that they have been

164
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,180
written there are in translation and joke

165
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,650
there are not thousands obviously they are

166
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,259
very few because that the

167
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,180
actual big work that was done

168
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,160
was of decision of the architecture

169
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,380
choice of the components then choice of the

170
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,389
most appropriate bittorrent client choice

171
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:33,710
of the most appropriate distribution

172
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,550
etc.  etc.

173
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,380
then a sled because the

174
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,020
recent kernel has air because it has a

175
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,300
higher minimum script ability

176
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,130
than others and things of this

177
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,970
kind on the server side

178
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,190
what is there to do is just serve

179
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,060
the files and start a tracker that  it's

180
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,039
more or less around here

181
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,360
ok client side it's quite simple

182
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,669
because it just has to start

183
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:03,199
really you don't see it anyway then I give you

184
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,270
the address of the wiki on which there is all the

185
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,759
description including the scripts in

186
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,789
more beautiful form than the subscribers here  on the

187
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:14,810
client side, the bittorrent client starts which in

188
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,139
this case is air some air not from

189
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,710
this this interesting thing that in the

190
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,560
moment in which that is  able book that is to

191
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,750
some luca which you can hook to

192
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,909
do actions in function of

193
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,430
modification of the context in this

194
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,828
case the modification of the

195
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:36,559
trivial context when all the data when all

196
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,610
the data

197
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,130
can decide to terminate

198
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,570
directly aria which is this yes of

199
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,860
time  0

200
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,100
and at this point the aria client terminates

201
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,440
and I can start the key and Greek that

202
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,680
this point passes the control to the new

203
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,779
kernel then to the

204
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:56,930
final target operating system ok then we think for a

205
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,970
second on any

206
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,329
further possibilities then from the old to the

207
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:04,399
new what it is  happened

208
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,720
this was that the mega tftp that was there

209
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,699
before causing the monstrous boot time

210
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:15,800
in the opposite direction hard half an hour

211
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,720
is not cheap if we are all there with 100

212
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,720
students waiting to take the exam and

213
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,639
they can't always do it especially

214
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,680
when something doesn't work something doesn't

215
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,670
work it means

216
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,029
maybe starting from scratch and then

217
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:31,639
waiting another half hour

218
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,589
the other is the compressed  one and

219
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,769
decompression of the system and this

220
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:41,059
qualitatively is the

221
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:44,120
time-saving view but this is the situation of

222
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,439
our network but the interesting thing is

223
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:51,230
the performance measured also here

224
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,589
measured eye in the sense that then

225
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,949
aria willing has an rpc interface

226
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:02,740
that could be investigated  and interrogate to

227
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,180
calculate the times precisely but

228
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,829
honestly on these orders of

229
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:09,769
magnitude where we talk about minutes if one

230
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:11,750
even eye looks when the cars

231
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,699
have thrown all of them after I show the

232
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:15,800
video a stopwatch is more than enough

233
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,490


234
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,410
even if I am wrong by a few seconds out of

235
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,660
five or  ten minutes it is not that it

236
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,439
changes my life

237
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:25,579
and if you see here the

238
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:28,160
performance improvement is remarkable and it is inspect that is

239
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,850
and then they exist this is not the first

240
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,670
job that deals with trying the

241
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,679
bittorrent protocol to boot there

242
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,240
are at least four other jobs  that

243
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,679
we mention both in the thesis and in the wiki

244
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,779
that had already done experiments in this

245
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,939
sense were experiments for  ò much more

246
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,429
complex that maybe they were going to change

247
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:51,319
the peak protocol and inserting a

248
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:53,540
bittorrent client inside peak and that does not

249
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,939
become a boast about doing is what

250
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:57,410
you see here I have shown

251
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,269
qualitatively in a few dozen

252
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:01,069
lines of code indeed in that

253
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:02,509
deciding lines  of code there were also

254
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:04,939
comments it was possible to realize this stuff

255
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:07,310
the only complex thing to do here

256
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,180
seems to be the distribution of sled and super

257
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,070
stripped down as they say you see

258
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,880
I was saying the times are very interesting

259
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,140
sorry these the

260
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,360
average transmission speed and  these are the times

261
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,940
this is the boot time as a function

262
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,920
of the number of machines

263
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,520
if you notice then the classic system

264
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,170
obviously now here it seems

265
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,240
exponential probably it is not exactly

266
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,550
exponential anyway because it is not said

267
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,920
that the scale is correct however it is

268
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,410
at least linear ok at least

269
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,170
linear while in the case of the bit torrent

270
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,930
that the green line you see below and

271
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:54,110
the time is clear between 841 you change

272
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,970
m  from 41 onwards you see that between 41124 it

273
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,770
does not change very much indeed it does not change

274
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,290
practically because at a certain point you

275
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,990
get a sort of

276
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,200
collapsed homogenization of client and server so in

277
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,320
fact the server does a more or less

278
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,680
constant stuff and then if the  they fan the single

279
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,540
nodes of the network

280
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,510
these are the boot times

281
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,520
this was seals hydration from before sorry

282
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,710
these of the boot time you see that from

283
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,650
1.380 seconds to throw all three

284
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,130
classrooms

285
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,310
we went to 315 seconds for

286
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,870
each other we are 300 and  1300 ok the

287
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,030
existing works I said are cited these links

288
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:43,250
of the page where you can find practically

289
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,870
all the possible downloadable

290
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,089
imaginable there is no image of tax

291
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:49,980
but honestly

292
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,130
I did not have time to do it I was on

293
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,139
vacation and honestly I did not start

294
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:58,269
doing the  'sled image to

295
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:00,790
load also because unfortunately in

296
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,860
our case the image is a

297
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,050
tad bit customized because we have

298
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,380
a bit of weird hardware and that's okay the results are

299
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,120
very good because we have you

300
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,519
monstrously reduced boot mpi and the

301
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,670
bootstrap

302
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,990
distribution is basically

303
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,870
a fairly recent kernel distribution so for

304
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,220
good or bad it sees all the

305
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,180
possible hardware imaginable

306
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,370
there is no need to make changes to

307
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,649
existing protocols in the sense that tftp

308
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,329
has not changed the  peak and should not be

309
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:35,470
modified

310
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,980
absolutely standard stuff is used

311
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,029
all three free obviously the work

312
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:45,040
done is in turn distributed with

313
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,290
a free license what was done in the

314
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,279
case of our department is a tad bit

315
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,959
more parameterization that is at

316
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,360
this moment the script and  hard core

317
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,670
as if it were a complicated stuff the

318
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,079
script are in fact twenty lines of

319
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:01,269
code 1 the fingers and changes what

320
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:04,540
must change for a use let's say the

321
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,839
finally end probable final user must

322
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,470
do a little more but the use

323
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,089
in sila but the boe  our

324
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,120
laboratory will probably not take place in

325
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,009
production there have been tests done

326
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:20,800
at the moment because I repeat it

327
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,420
can  Unfortunately it is in my opinion if they will be

328
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,550
quite a bloodbath they plan

329
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,600
to switch to a

330
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,029
completely different architecture based on virtual

331
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:31,029
server and therefore virtual server

332
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:33,009
and desktop remote control so to

333
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:35,500
speak and so god knows what they will do

334
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,430
is therefore contin client exactly and I

335
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,120
don't know  if the fact is never for the whole university and

336
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,069
they have like eight machines with 206 gb of

337
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:51,699
ram moon all and I don't know a few

338
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:57,220
thousand thanks for the technical term was

339
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,620
what we thought too and

340
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,720
our technical support that is our

341
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,899
department

342
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,059
no for what it does  it is powerful because in

343
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:11,290
any case the network is not then the network is broken then

344
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,839
the network is really I do not know among

345
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,999
others the individual departments it may

346
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,839
not be like this but it could be the

347
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,209
[ __ ] and races all races so it is

348
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:28,018
quite enough wired that is well

349
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,489
I do not know not you  I know how to say I really don't

350
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:41,309
know how to say it is not indifferent I guess

351
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:51,429
ok ok not then you can't in the sense that

352
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:55,540
you are not obliged to just ok because we

353
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,819
in this  this moment I repeat we

354
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:01,660
mean the university technician service

355
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,970
we seem to be of different entities

356
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,679
visa university technician technical service

357
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,199
of our department me and davide me

358
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:11,319
teacher he graduate student ok to know

359
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:13,480
who the actors are who is doing

360
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,769
this migration project the

361
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:17,019
University technical service with which I

362
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,579
do not have relations so I do not know

363
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:22,709
what decisions they are making that I do not

364
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:23,829
shoot

365
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:26,529
we hope everything is fine but keep in

366
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:28,299
mind that the university hardware is

367
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:31,660
quite obsolete in general and they do not

368
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,819
plan to change the hardware  client

369
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:42,669
I mean and for what I was asking and for

370
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:43,020
what

371
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,160
I was asking if it was mandatory and certainly

372
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,930
good between coming from throwing a

373
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:55,740
microbial robot that is the analogue of

374
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,600
a bnc so to speak I mean

375
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,180
the analogue of a vnc that is sufficient

376
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,770
that as a type of non  I mentioned

377
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,690
there is a need for the stuff I use no

378
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,569
no not because it's not just to give

379
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:15,270
a metaphor I'll be able to tell you next year

380
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,790
eventual  mind what

381
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,900
the eventual bloodbath was or almost is,

382
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,599
write down all the funny things in

383
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,640
my opinion that can be done downstream of this

384
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,510
experiment in quotation marks is that then

385
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,980
we used it in a very

386
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,400
particular context agrees but it could

387
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,600
be  interesting to do some

388
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,690
experiments like doing this but this

389
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,720
the itas and letting bittorrent start and

390
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,670
then not stop it that is not going to

391
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,550
quebec and throwing another

392
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,980
machine directly but throwing it with a virtual

393
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,930
machine tele to mean a bad

394
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,370
one with a virtual machine and meanwhile leave it

395
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,180
under  lost which acts as a feeder ok

396
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,100
and this is interesting as a kind of

397
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,840
thing because at that point I have an

398
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,450
avalanche of siders that among other things

399
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,800
this system was not obliged to

400
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,000
levels all on the same network

401
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,670
we can have them on who knows where one

402
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,320
instead  than to go in pixels to load

403
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,450
the initial sled if the download

404
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,360
lead them ok 1 download it with a url or it

405
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,100
will install a launch in turn a

406
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,810
virtual mach  ine and then he plays all the

407
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,310
games he wants for purposes that it

408
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,050
could be fun to

409
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,910
experiment this genre I repeat below

410
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,780


411
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,700
I would have liked to do it in this is at the sea

412
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,230
on the beach honestly I wanted more

413
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,030
to sunbathe than

414
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,470
to start making pictures of  of the teese

415
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,290
the process you can collect

416
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,270
statistics says air a

417
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,100
quite interesting repici interface that gives you

418
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,260
all the timings the status etc.

419
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,710
for which you can develop and statistics

420
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,510
from all from all nodes and of course

421
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,310
the list of nodes you have it  in the tracker

422
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,770
to be clear, you could use it to

423
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,570
clon the but of the machines

424
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,730
instead of to boot for example

425
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,500
and whoever has it fully you can

426
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,460
invent

427
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,280
tons of stuff I will show you on the

428
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,139
fly very slow let's see if it works

429
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:23,609
yes then there would be  even the audio but

430
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,139
who

431
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:26,580
cares we did it in the dark because this

432
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,109
way you can see better the monitors that

433
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:30,690
gradually turn on this is one of the

434
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,549
classrooms  and the tav

435
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:34,109
if you see the duration of the video is

436
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:36,359
slightly greater than the boot time

437
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,739
so fair as you see the PCs that

438
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:42,330
throw in the sense that they do it first

439
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,039
obviously by the pics and then at

440
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:47,639
some point they load I go ahead and not

441
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:49,350
I'm showing you everything that doesn't give a

442
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,399
damn

443
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,769
there is a certain point I think with the

444
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:58,619
foreground in which gradually if one follows all

445
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:01,320
the machines each machine publishes

446
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,230
its status and that of the bit torrent in

447
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,409
which you can see the seed ratio

448
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:08,940
etcetera etcetera because quite

449
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,820
interesting is the last thing then I

450
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,309
let you go it was so funny it

451
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:16,109
was so funny to see the face

452
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:17,730
of our sisal win when we

453
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,580
made the total buzz because we got used to

454
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,190
half an hour and more of time when

455
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,200
we started everyone which practically is

456
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,179
as if they were turned over and over

457
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,190
and over and everything was thrown away they are left of

458
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,080
kaka and we are with great

459
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,299
satisfaction for us and for the undergraduate

460
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,029
especially the undergraduate is very good of

461
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:38,730
course the work  gold you can see it is not

462
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,289
a complicated job it was a job

463
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:44,070
of choosing certain tools

464
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,749
unfortunately he is a guy who uses a

465
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:48,749
lot of windows and for which I with

466
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,090
great satisfaction forced him to

467
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,789
do this type of work and not

468
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:55,649
where I convinced him  because I have not convinced him

469
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:58,440
but in short let's say that it sucks less

470
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,029
there you do not respect what it sucks if

471
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:05,840
previously ok if there are questions
