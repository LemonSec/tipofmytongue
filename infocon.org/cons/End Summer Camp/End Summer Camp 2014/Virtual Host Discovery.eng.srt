1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:03,149
so good morning everyone my name is

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,009
alessandro tanasi

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,269
today we will talk about how to discover

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,700
names and virtues lost a few words about me

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,480
and I deal with various projects cuckoo

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,050
sandbox for the analysis of malware malware

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,029
that a site of dynamic analysis of

8
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,849
malware sec docs  that a

9
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,510
documentation site the documents relating to

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,800
security I tour which is an

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,190
image forensics and haastrup project that we will see

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,870


13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,329
later straight to the purpose of tokyo

14
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,510
since there is little time when you want to do a

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,680
penetration test an assessment

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,629
something like that the first  what you

17
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,370
need is to know the number and

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,680
type of input to go and

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,090
check, for example, in such a

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,400
photograph how many entries then the

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,840
internet

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,560
and this is essential for you to know

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,600
that you only have at the door above the stairs

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,880
or you know that to know  that you have windows

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,119
and other doors

26
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,569
how many of you do a penetration test

27
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:28,020
ok ok the most important basic notion of

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,030
all this talk is the concept of

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,450
virtual hosting sp  it to save

30
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,569
ip what happens that you have a

31
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,700
machine a host with a beautiful

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,470
ip address 42 00 42 that it displays and of the

33
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,220
various services

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,439
you want these services you can find them in various

35
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,840
ways such as through sport scanning with in the

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,770
maps

37
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,049
and you discover that there are examples of

38
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:59,259
more http effects  you go there to check for

39
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,600
example by putting lippi in your

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,859
browser you arrive in peace installed and

41
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,318
you get this the default virtual

42
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,739
host or the virtual host the site

43
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:14,080
that is served to you if you go there

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,450
via ip but often on a machine

45
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,370
that does virtue  hosting does shared hosting

46
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,040
is not only configured the site that

47
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,319
responds to the ip of the machine

48
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,040
various other sites are configured porn site 1

49
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,890
dot com porn site 2 dot com

50
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,760
etc.

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,130
you must have the knowledge of which

52
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,079
the name of these sites to go and

53
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,610
view them correctly then

54
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,269
test the association of all these

55
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:46,390
names in blue with the IPI name is

56
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,819
called virtual host

57
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,890
ok it is an application thing because it knows  there

58
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,870
an http service can have its

59
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,239
virtual hosts which are trivially

60
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,200
called websites an ftp service can

61
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,350
also have different ones because it is lost and

62
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,690
therefore respond differently with different

63
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,540
folders different permissions

64
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,319
different ying accounts according to which the

65
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,930
name with which entries arrive  where the name

66
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,579
and the name of ns that you put in your

67
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:21,209
ftp client

68
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,370
so you when you do a penetration

69
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,989
test an assessment and in reality you are

70
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,750
given if black box only the only lippi in

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,900
you know only lippi is up to you to

72
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,190
be able to recover this  'other

73
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,599
part in blue which are the names nor

74
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,290
virtual hosts

75
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,700
ok it's clear what is born so

76
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,519
how to get from unipi that a customer sees

77
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,420
to have the most complete list possible

78
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,579
of all virtual hosts that

79
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:54,950
are there the main idea is a process  of

80
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,189
numbering made up of various steps that is

81
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:02,900
what you have and them plus this and p

82
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,430
you can put it in various processes that

83
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,120
are to make dns queries

84
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,709
use vulnerabilities that there is the macc  hina

85
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,680
in order to have a kind of list

86
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,470
of host names followed by this is a

87
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,320
machine to make a brut force of all

88
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,090
our possible amys of this world

89
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,830
sooner or later someone will answer you and you will

90
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,199
find out which one it belongs to or

91
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,330
simply use the

92
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,289
basic package of the websites  google or

93
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:36,770
use

94
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,720
some applications maybe there are certain

95
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,340
applications that if you call

96
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,610
the name of the machine in one way ok use

97
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,229
all these techniques which we then see in

98
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,960
detail but the important thing is that you understand

99
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,479
that they are different types of

100
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,389
taxonomic techniques done differently for

101
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:58,190
get a raw list of names in pure

102
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,930
p and cdp and the machine names that

103
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,030
you are going to check for example if

104
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,680
a technology vida pip dotcom you

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,710
after born on the dns made by queries and

106
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,770
ask me what ip corresponds to foo

107
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,520
dot com

108
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,870
if it tells you 1.1  .1 it is evidently

109
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,800
the information through a technique you

110
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,659
have used is wrong

111
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:26,960
if it tells you 40 20 42 the information you

112
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,909
have kept  to and good that virtual host is

113
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:32,650
valid ok so then you will go to test it

114
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,440
so you have a search process in

115
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,110
various ways that gives you a heavy list that

116
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,040
you want to be born verify

117
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,100
after this comes out the list of

118
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,170
good application names so let's start from the

119
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,130
first thing from the most

120
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,670
the enumeration of names via dns is trivial

121
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,050
because if you get there by writing to

122
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,150
people.com in the browser someone and dns has necessarily

123
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:03,510
configured various

124
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,620
techniques

125
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,920
the first one do a reverse lookup easy

126
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,000
easy

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,340
what gives you as an answer is

128
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,900
really one of the possible names

129
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,810
machine because configured on dns you

130
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,770
ask dns sorry dns ma lippi 111 what

131
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,550
name corresponds to he tells you or I do not know

132
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,850
or corresponds to aa.vv dot com for

133
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,330
example and this is a good answer

134
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,130
but on a virtual hosting of a thousand sites

135
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,750
you discover one that  maybe in the name of the

136
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,990
machine you understand that your tester has

137
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,330
very little meaning in being with

138
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,140
others so go for a bit

139
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,050
of caching try it and see s  and the

140
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,590
result that comes out is good

141
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,970
for example take the nate and next

142
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,830
and mx records of the domain that tell you who nn

143
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,100
server that the mail server will be another

144
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,940
name

145
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,120
go and check maybe the same

146
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,030
one that does all this hosting  ago

147
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,729
mail service fi name server

148
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:17,000
find out other names ok but these are

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,699
already things that must be verified try

150
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:20,900
on the nejm they would be approved a

151
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,330
transfer of bona sam server is

152
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,160
vulnerable

153
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,389
now I hope there should

154
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:29,000
be no more in 2014 but I assure you that

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,100
by car it happens to you  get the

156
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,780
complete dump of the whole ns area

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,580
then there are the srv record those

158
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,430
used for the

159
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,960
example service location to find out which one is used for

160
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,250
aabar of a domain

161
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,620
are widely used by windows for

162
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,210
example find out which is the domain

163
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,880
controller for a domain  and in recent

164
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,919
years you have seen several of these and

165
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,360
these are on the main in reality

166
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,199
he our support a lot of snoring on the

167
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,380
record there was the infinite stalls

168
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,930
eg  piously there are those who

169
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,389
give you the public key files it prevents

170
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,220
if you know that in short there is the pc a lot of

171
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,650
stuff

172
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,440
the first thing that can come while one

173
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,250
is yes ok but if me or the name configured

174
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,300
in the dns

175
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,570
I know that this client  here is the owner

176
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,130
of the people.com site

177
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,169
I just need force products

178
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,630
and I try all the possible subdomains

179
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,970
puntocom v1 v2 mail punto.com I try them

180
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,769
all

181
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:36,019
and see which ones correspond to lipica I'm

182
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:38,808
interested in this is one of the

183
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:40,759
most used techniques by the various tools  that what

184
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,729
you find around that is the stuff of

185
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:49,959
simple queries to or to for most you are

186
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:51,619
the problem with this thing is that it takes

187
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:54,589
a lot of time you make a lot of

188
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:57,769
traffic and if these are a little

189
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:58,910
awake

190
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,999
they notice it radius on the number  of

191
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,009
query that goes through the Sassaro order

192
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:07,069
they realize it immediately and honestly it is

193
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:08,420
also risky to withdraw it if you are

194
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,399
local type withdraw the disorder if needed

195
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,259
if you use a script suitable for

196
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,540
parallelism and to the detriment of the cabbage

197
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,980
badly done in s  u internet there are a

198
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,899
lot of them and risky if you really want to do such

199
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:21,739
a thing

200
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:24,529
I suggest you get a good word

201
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,860
list was found good and I

202
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,410
suggest you use those taken

203
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,420
from the statistics of the most

204
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,329
used names on the internet for example alexa

205
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:37,939
publishes a statistic  of the

206
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:39,860
most used machine names I advise you to

207
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,819
use something like this

208
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:48,369
then taken in various ways by checking

209
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:50,899
all the most common types of records

210
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:54,679
used by the business system and if

211
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,600
you wanted to do also for brut

212
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,360
forcing go to the numbering at

213
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,959
the application level, that is to see which ones

214
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,610
managed to get names out of

215
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,980
applications and it's great because there

216
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,439
are a lot of protocols and a lot

217
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:11,420
of applications that by default by

218
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,309
design simply because they work

219
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:16,189
so try to think

220
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:19,490
of smtp mail exchange how it works and they tell you

221
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,610
the booth of the  machine in the banner

222
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,470
and it is returned to you when you

223
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,100
connect to the service so maybe a

224
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,050
u  further machine name velo managed to

225
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,940
get out from here too or an

226
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,070
additional virtual host the one on which

227
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,680
the single mail service runs or

228
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,750
other velo manage to get out of here

229
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,110
after we always move to an even

230
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,829
higher level

231
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:47,079
in the detail of the

232
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,500
application implementation a  typical

233
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,019
thing nowadays most of the services

234
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:56,180
should have seemed it is true all of

235
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,410
you have followed encrypted as they are

236
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,690
done they are done through ssl

237
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,890
tls protocol which provides by design to give you

238
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:11,329
back a certificate x5 09 if

239
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:13,550
these certificates are not bad

240
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,980
that is, if they are not made by default

241
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,579
they usually have fields that contain

242
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:21,920
a stream and inside them this example of the

243
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,110
airport here in Venice

244
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,480
tells you which lost the names relative to another

245
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,120
place where you can get

246
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,560
out our even more in

247
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,630
straight up in

248
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,670
the implementation of the application leaving out the various

249
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,940
layers of protocols and you have the

250
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,070
wonderful world of how they are  tte

251
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,060
applications you have web applications that

252
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,640
give you re direkt to other sites maybe

253
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,890
on the same machine so if you want to

254
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,089
follow the king direkt you come up with

255
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:00,720
other host names

256
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,050
patton crawling of the website maybe you

257
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,610
bring out others or streams

258
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,769
of course veils pull out veins you will pull

259
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,990
out also to external sites because

260
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,629
obviously a site links to other sites

261
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:14,339
but you want as we said before the last

262
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,310
step is to check

263
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,180
take the list thanks to the verified

264
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,310
and still remember most of the

265
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,980
protocols leak the stream from

266
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,689
da sap sambonet bajos  most of the

267
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:32,730
protocols by design and tells you which

268
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,189
stream is of the machine or the stream of

269
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:38,329
the configured service

270
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:41,790
obviously who does not do it immediately for

271
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,569
free

272
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:44,639
maybe it does it if you want successful theaters

273
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,220
competition a mistake try to think for

274
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,750
example of peace

275
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,149
you want a mandate  in error and he in the

276
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:52,980
default screen below tells you

277
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,129
version together with the configured or

278
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:59,959
tells you the stream and tells you the stream

279
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,050
remembers  you these are names

280
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,079
for which it is not said that they are

281
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,449
configured in the dns I give you an example

282
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:15,839
on my website

283
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,940
I forgot to remove

284
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,759
old sites ten years ago I no longer

285
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,769
renewed the domains

286
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,380
but those sites are still present if

287
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,399
you want to call me  a web server

288
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,490
using the application one he

289
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,490
still needs the old site so do not

290
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,560
assume that the virtual hosts at

291
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,000
the application level are still

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,750
configured in the dns and this is a

293
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,089
very nice thing of

294
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,860
course you can

295
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,259
also brute forcing the rim hosts at the level

296
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,120
application if you take peace

297
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,819
of mind to do brute forcing of the cam post go over

298
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:54,790
all the lost verses with the usual

299
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,709
speech of it takes time it takes a

300
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,329
good world lists you risk drawing the

301
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:00,490
machine to make traffic to get

302
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,720
caught

303
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,069
and so on all the problems of the bruss

304
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:06,819
forcing if instead you must have

305
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:09,699
totally used

306
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:12,250
techniques and passive numbering

307
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,639
so try not to make traffic ver  I know the

308
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,670
systems of your client of our

309
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,640
target

310
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,450
and here in recent years there is really

311
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,420
indulging because it is once I don't know

312
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,270
if you remember we used bing tv with

313
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,570
dork ip glue to find all the

314
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,700
virtual hosts

315
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,250
now there is a plethora  of sites that does

316
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,740
data mining that collects data that does

317
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,470
analytics in which really this list

318
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,660
here I have jotted down the things that

319
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,400
come to mind but it takes a lot

320
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,560
try to think of all the various

321
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,920
internet sensus or internet scans of which

322
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,630
there are terabytes and  terabyte iridata weil

323
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,770
and ball certified supports open

324
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,730
services on reverse dns or all the

325
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,790
various sites and dns history such as domain

326
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,410
dools or showdown trivially or

327
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,010
some sites for malgara analysis that

328
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,830
give you information of passive dns

329
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,380
also virustotal type and it does so lately in

330
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,070
which  if you put an ip and this ep has

331
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,640
passed through its song sandbox it demonstrates

332
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,420
the passive dns data that collected so

333
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,260
here there really is a lot how to

334
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,030
do this

335
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,040
then hold on  and I realize what you will come in

336
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,730
contact with so far is the idea of how it

337
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,620
should be done of how you would do it you

338
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,750
love if if they ask you to do it

339
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,760
obviously it is not given there are

340
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,130
tours that already do it of most

341
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,709
of the tours I have seen

342
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:58,149
is that I have  used in my life most of

343
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:01,449
it sucks but really sucks there is only

344
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:03,759
a little more than small scripts made

345
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,810
by incompetents who don't even know how to

346
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,589
program there is integration for

347
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:10,660
very few of these techniques in

348
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,370
famous frameworks like I maintain

349
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,850
metasploit it or  map which, however, are

350
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,910
perhaps limited to brute forcing reverse

351
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,399
lockup are not true

352
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,509
numbering techniques that of hosts in there are

353
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:30,240
others that do more things like fears or

354
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,230
bale suite or even to racconigi they do

355
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,660
various things but for example the numbering

356
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,790
on the dns do it  with all types of

357
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,149
records, however, they do not do

358
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:47,949
everything that one can think of from

359
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:50,259
these tours there is no tool that does

360
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,630
everything you can think of

361
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,300
a tool of these that host map I

362
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,339
wrote it  o three years ago with the

363
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:59,350
aim of implementing everything that

364
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,889
34 years ago was the state of

365
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,180
the art of the numbering of names

366
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,130
and at the time I must say that it worked

367
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,750
fairly well now I have

368
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,010
not maintained it for three years so I do not know

369
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,599
even more if it works with the versions

370
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,480
of ruby that are there now the tool that

371
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,069
I recommend follows that

372
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,130
I would recommend because it is that good or bad it is a rip in

373
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,920
python of ostra and in being with which it is the

374
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,020
one that implements

375
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,640
most of the technique  and it is written in python

376
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,770
so it is good to remember it finished

377
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,730
because time is short if there are questions if

378
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,890
you have not understood anything let's

379
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,580
start over

380
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,820
yes

381
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:57,080
sure

382
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,549
yes it's true because everyone has had

383
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:08,630
a customer signed a document that

384
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,230
authorizes you to do for 300 est  however many

385
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,690
times it happens that the customers' machines

386
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,179
are not so sun they are old machines

387
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,840
configured badly and he and every day

388
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,130
lily in the gray line from the systems

389
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,289
are about to come down to total death and

390
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:32,179
stay up  only because that queen does not pass

391
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:35,990
if that day that you joined

392
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,259
penetration test there are those 200

393
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:42,649
those of our one minute more there may

394
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:45,519
be problems is the coverage

395
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,850
trivially if bad neighbor files on

396
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,970
an http server that is already loaded with her

397
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,450
because  maybe a crm turns us on a very

398
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,920
heavy thing god knows and you go there to fail

399
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,140
a two pictures second maybe this

400
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,760
comes down already if you ask him a request

401
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,170
in the browsers he takes a second to

402
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:11,190
answer you understand in theory no but you

403
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,580
do not know

404
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,380
you always have to go there with the

405
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,020
lead feet other questions of

406
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,820
course once you have found all the

407
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,940
application names that is a part

408
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,830
of the information gathering activity

409
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,559
that you know later when you have completed the

410
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,650
whole part the information gathering

411
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,320
move on to the actual testing you have

412
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,330
found that it sounds p

413
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,020
there are twenty websites veit star there

414
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,169
all but if you of that pious one is

415
00:19:57,169 --> 00:19:59,990
found only ten websites

416
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,090
the ten others you never test them and

417
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:07,029
you will never know what's on it but

418
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,149
c  sure

419
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:15,580
sure your concept is that you don't

420
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:21,339
test you have to aim for the virginity

421
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:25,539
of the mary to test one hundred

422
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:30,369
percent of the inputs obviously you

423
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:31,570
will never get there

424
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,129
because of how software is made for a lot

425
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:35,830
of reasons then tried to do the best

426
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,210
you can  at least if there are 30 sites on

427
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:40,809
a machine look for them

428
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:44,049
peck 28 also because then the

429
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,429
customer tells you sorry but how is it that the

430
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:49,059
term marked 5 the 130 take your head

431
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:53,349
there is this is a stupid

432
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:56,559
stupid stupid thing on which maybe you risk

433
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,299
the whole bets  the business because you

434
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:02,879
can be technically very good

435
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:05,979
but if you find a website on

436
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:07,869
which there is nothing you cannot find those on

437
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:09,249
which there are the world for example to

438
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:12,749
understand me amaya from mini three years ago

439
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,270
no because if your customers owe us

440
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,380
getting to the name must not be

441
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,860
hidden

442
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,320
yes but then if those are

443
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,030
private services it allows us to internal services

444
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,440
must not be exposed your problem

445
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,450
is not on the name and on the display of the

446
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,870
service

447
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,590
if you want

448
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,730
a real duty
