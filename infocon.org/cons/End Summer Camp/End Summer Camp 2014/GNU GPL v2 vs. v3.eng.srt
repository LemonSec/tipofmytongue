1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
calls I call then well I'm rick

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,389
I'm part of the forum and I just wanted to

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,790
discuss in this talk so

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,269
discuss it will not be just me

5
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:18,090
talking about the differences between the 2 the gpl

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,570
version 2 readable and gpl version 3 and

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,449
to do so obviously here is a little

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,180
austere  of what I will deal with but do not

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,920
think that it is faithful to what I

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,390
write and I am never faithful to what I

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,910
write first of all I wanted to start

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,820
with you with some questions

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,520
first of all I wanted to know if for

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,070
example between patents patents

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,820
copyright are the same thing in your opinion

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,260
because  they are different

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,370
would you know me answer

18
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,970
ah ok yes but it does not count as an answer it does not

19
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,989
count as a respect

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,490
I foresee the author to foresee the peak

21
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,240
becomes so also the patent I am alone it is

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,360
only a legislative thing that is not an

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:40,970
invented right but then I can say

24
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:47,899
congenital behavior among the  various states

25
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,240
then I'm sorry to disappoint you but it has been

26
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,790
standardized for several years then

27
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,200
first of all if copyright is

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,729
patent  or both start from a legal basis

29
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:03,890


30
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,380
, copyright is not not covered

31
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,639
by the law otherwise we certainly are not innate

32
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,500
in the sense that it arises when you conceive

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,260
the work but it is not in place in the sense that

34
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,200
in this sense in the sense  who has the

35
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,850
copyright in theory would not

36
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,450
need a registration for now

37
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,340
something different to say that in the act you save

38
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,730
but I need to create a work is already

39
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,190
protected by copyright

40
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,140
the patent must be registered but it is another

41
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,220
procedure protect the  same thing both of

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,330
them protect an idea but

43
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:57,019
copyright protects it no

44
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,350
both have paternity protects the as

45
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,040
tool less prime the form of your idea

46
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,010
the patent protects the industry lita

47
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,830
of your exact idea

48
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,880


49
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,280
are transferable  two of the two rights

50
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,220
are not transferable the moral rights are

51
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,700
transferable the patrimonial rights

52
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,220
tell me tell me but it is done on purpose

53
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:33,920
this wrong of to provoke

54
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,290
the moral right is not transferable in any case if

55
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,510
you are always recognized as the father of the

56
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,840
your work

57
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,110
no no it's not like this because in any case we

58
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:50,360
have implemented the latest regulations it may

59
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,510
then be on the various states I don't

60
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,020
know how to tell you

61
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,460
in Italy or in the United States the

62
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,340
moral right is always with the author

63
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,560
so much so even in patents  so much

64
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,270
so that you cannot change s.to

65
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,150
extend in the united states the owner

66
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,190
of the patent el applicants the one who to the

67
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,840
patrimonial rights you can not

68
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,079
get them at the moment of the registration

69
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,870
of the patent there is at the moment write me

70
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,880
of the viscous extension at the moment

71
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,770
registration with the European patent office

72
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,610


73
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,330
only afterwards, therefore the link between moral rights is very strong,

74
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,490
so the

75
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,650
United States and Italy are

76
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,780
always yours moral rights are not trainable they

77
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,950
are not transferable

78
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,320
no patrimonial do us what

79
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,070
you prefer best of  who is it that

80
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,570
defines the author as the inventor but can

81
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,780
you tell me there is a rule a paragraph that

82
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,090
tells me who the inventor is who is that

83
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,530
gives me a definition of author or

84
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,780
inventor  and go go go

85
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,070
it has nothing to do not

86
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,530
rightly for the word but always a

87
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,820
patent for something that we do not

88
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,159
care exactly today

89
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,710
there is something that is said who aiel who is

90
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,840
the inventor that the author an article of

91
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,510
law one  sentence something

92
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,349
according to you there may be

93
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,100
no someone who defines who the car is

94
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,400
the concept of author or inventor

95
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,060
I tell you no there is no law does not

96
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,000
establish who is the author the inventor if he

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,490
does not give a certain definition he declares

98
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,890
author the inventor what he can do

99
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,720
we have already seen what it is in this framework

100
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,480
what is the license according to you we have

101
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,520
seen that there is an inventor who has

102
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,980
rights who has rights that are to

103
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,020
start ideas that are protected

104
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,840
or  with the patent with the copyright

105
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,690
the license how you get into all this

106
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,050
game

107
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:18,740
exactly is the use exactly is a no

108
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,860
to mess up here there is samuele here

109
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,530
thanks I loaded the countdown damn it

110
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,860
but terrible that a misery if I

111
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,510
put the chick  pia while pole then

112
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:37,120
give  po then the license license for use

113
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,950
establishes how you can use my

114
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,430
work

115
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,410
and what exactly you think is a

116
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,560
contract copyright patent what they

117
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,980
are instead

118
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,120
you are complicating too much

119
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,600
what are the property

120
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,800
titles essentially property titles

121
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,770
copyright  from the law, however, the

122
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,700
form of ownership the patent is a

123
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,600
form of ownership encoded in an act

124
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,450
that is then approved as it is

125
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,000
approved etc. it is good

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,919
here is what we are talking about it

127
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,720
made me a small mental map of

128
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,840
what our

129
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,310
reference  we have the inventor is the one who

130
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,620
generates the creative work to the

131
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,080
invention what this are his title

132
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,260
deeds who gives them to these titles

133
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,180
industrial property code copyright law

134
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,950


135
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,130
this is ipr intellectual property

136
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,979
rights are all and  two

137
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,120
industrial property rights

138
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,850
are ok for them, however if we talk about the

139
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,680
so-called digital right management, the rights management

140
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,380
system of  gitali

141
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,070
and on both of them

142
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,550
then we talk about industrial property

143
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,760
we are in this field here we are talking

144
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,610
about copyright we are in this field

145
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,130
here ok these protect an idea in

146
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,860
its realization the exclusivity of the

147
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,780
patrimonial rights linked to its

148
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,510
use in its production

149
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,770
these  these the diffusion

150
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,789
obviously simplifying it all

151
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:33,380
night much more but simplifying it

152
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:40,440
let's say the diffusion of a work ok and

153
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,450
the license agreement and as an action on the

154
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,930
right the invitation as I make

155
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,650
others enjoy payment or for free

156
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,839
his problems

157
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,330
here are these tough this take  at least

158
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,030
three four minutes mystical body to mechanical body

159
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,870


160
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:05,510
then if I sell you a book

161
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,600
ok what happened

162
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:15,519
what I passed to you but

163
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,820
also the work but there is but now I

164
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,300
ask you another question to understand I pass you a

165
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,820
cd with a  operating system a

166
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,980
proprietary cd that I paid does it to you we do

167
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,240
not see what is lawful or

168
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,480
illegal I do not pass it to you

169
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,060
no it is lawful to pass you cd with the system

170
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,190
or  perative you can install it on your

171
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,880
computer that operating system takes away

172
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,390
the theory no it cannot install however the

173
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:51,210
cd that exclusions no no forget it

174
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,560
you are getting too specific

175
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,710
we stay more than minutes so I have to

176
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,690
cut and these are important to

177
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,540
understand the differences that  I am there I

178
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,170
pass you a cd ok the ownership of the seal

179
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,470
italo past or not of the cd

180
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,070
physical support exactly the mechanical body I

181
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,040
pass it through the property the

182
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,470
mystical body is not necessarily passed in the

183
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,700
case of the book that also passed the

184
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,730
mystical body yes it  you can read yes but

185
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,360
because there is a law that says that the

186
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,220
patrimonial rights there is a law in

187
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,610
the ritual text that the patrimonial rights

188
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,470
on the work are exhausted in the first

189
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,150
sale within the

190
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,400
community territory are you could light

191
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:47,140
so the program  no but why not

192
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,090
because the property that is because it is a

193
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:52,120
license I pass you I sell you a

194
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,860
property Chile has acquired

195
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,280
illegally and it is all

196
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,220
yours  program no because the license and

197
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,720
remains the center I have not passed you the

198
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,640
ownership of a program

199
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,070
and know immediately by

200
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,839
simplifying to bodies you always buy

201
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,970
the mechanical body never the mystical

202
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,580
body mystical body for example in the book I have it

203
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,779
with trip in quotation marks only because it

204
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,550
c  'it is a law that says that after

205
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,230
you can affect it well this is a bit

206
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,870
because when the gpl was born but

207
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,670
I think you all know it better

208
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:35,990
than me 89 for the case is max m salman

209
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,459
had changed the emak code  he knows,

210
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,050
however, is but it was then sold by

211
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,070
goslin from uni press which then had

212
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,520
closed it anyway and therefore was

213
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,860
forced to rewrite the code is

214
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,120
in fact it was released without

215
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,550
restrictions and had involved a

216
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,410
change in the distribution of this

217
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,060
software of the license d  I use it and I

218
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:06,440
have been a bit imprecise here comes out 2

219
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,240
and finally comes out born in 2005

220
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,670
remember that there are 14 years of

221
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:19,350
difference and we see it exactly and

222
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,750
we see it so we know g  ià what

223
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,450
the gpl establishes the freedoms to

224
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,010
modify receive and distribute the

225
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,100
code recognize the copyright they

226
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,779
recognize it so much so that in the gpl

227
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,550
version 2 of the preamble it is written that

228
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,380
only thanks to this license you can

229
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,610
make that software if there was no

230
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,660
license

231
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,220
all rights reserved by default you

232
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,740
pass with all rights reserved

233
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,820
the definition of rights for

234
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,910
the user in a positive way

235
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,970
is not like in the license that you who are

236
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,529
written in the copyright that I

237
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:52,290
believe you can not do this if  not etc

238
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,880
no you can do this this and this

239
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,440
in these ways you have to redistribute it in

240
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,550
this other way you can configure

241
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,709
economic aspects but let's go

242
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:07,459
here for a moment la3 la3

243
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,660
first of all it is an alice there is the

244
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,310
so-called transaction and identity

245
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,580
or when you take a

246
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,130
company asset which includes LPG assets the

247
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,570
license remains ok case it is but the

248
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,010
situation of the piece of furniture that has

249
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,520
arisen with the 9

250
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,980
article 11 is patentability quest  o it is

251
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,980
a very very very stringent article

252
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,690
in the sense that while in ii it was

253
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,020
simply said you can patent but if you

254
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,750
patent your distribution must

255
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,250
be compliant with gpl version 2

256
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,710
so beyond this it is also said it must

257
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,960
be variety all over the world

258
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,530
impossible not exclusive there  it can be

259
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:06,640
free from royalties it can cost us and must

260
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,350
guarantee the possibility to create use

261
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,240
sell offer for sale import and

262
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,490
modify programs containing

263
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,760
the taxpayer version but

264
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,410
remember the true virality of

265
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,560
the gpl license so if I am a start

266
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,910
up or a patent now gpl nobody  for

267
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,400
example I will never buy a software

268
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,370
protected by the gpl version 3 x which necessarily

269
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,410
forced to take this poo

270
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,470
by premising that the first is

271
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,340
unattainable

272
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,930
I have worked many years in companies that

273
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,050
patent noe and exchange patents to

274
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,260
live and realize the first point the

275
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,790
others  they are very very difficult to

276
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,870
make

277
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,730
in the act pra because they just are

278
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,060
string  however, let's go further on the

279
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,350
mtp we will then talk about the tive case that

280
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,070
was the case according to which the

281
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,120
problem of the license version 3 broke out I estimate

282
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,280
what was active was a device

283
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,540
that whose software released in gplv2 open

284
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,400
completely open you could write

285
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,050
do prevent etc.

286
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,780
put them inside tivo tv did not

287
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,210
make you work it did not work because

288
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,790
because there were the rom in which

289
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,240
there were digital signatures of

290
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,780


291
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,940
approved programs inside your digital signature was not

292
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,740
within that the system did not

293
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,280
go  this is a limitation but

294
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,290
we talked before about the

295
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,110
mechanical body of the mystical body

296
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,490
let's reflect there is not a moment here on

297
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,150
the active case

298
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,930
I think

299
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,439
how to do it

300
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:03,039
sure

301
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,380
exactly you if you are able the sip

302
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,240
of the digital signatures you can really

303
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,960
remove it exactly is the property

304
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,700
exactly  however, such a clause

305
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,520
can put in crisis so much so that it is

306
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,390
a user product for a consumer market and

307
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,450
for a consumer market for merc  ato

308
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,950
business in fact the business market

309
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:33,410
is in fact excluded because in any case

310
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,920
equipment that requires a

311
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,330
certain certification they say how

312
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,090
I can not put my signatures my

313
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,270
signatures

314
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,399
I certify this asset and I

315
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,070
charge not so much on the license as

316
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,040
precisely on the fact that I  I certify

317
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,290
and therefore only the

318
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,399
concept of user product was created we have 33

319
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,450
seconds fast

320
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,510
so

321
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:18,369
then in that case it depends on

322
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,369
welding the chip for in that case there

323
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:23,740
is unfair competition to another

324
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,319
thing because you exploit a sea you resell

325
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,760
that brand branded as a branded joint

326
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,860
sorry without the chip but

327
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,890
you exploit the name of others

328
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:43,980
as a user exactly by a user you can

329
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,950
obviously if it is not protected by a patent

330
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,309
you can copy how the matrix is made

331
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:54,760
redo it if you exclude certain things put

332
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,890
others sell your grandmother this  this

333
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,419
you can do big is not covered by

334
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:01,200
patent and not using

335
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,490
the name and yes or even the form factor then

336
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:14,380
it depends on there it depends a lot on the

337
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,909
protection that exactly depends on these

338
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:22,480
things here but in theory if there

339
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,850
is no other

340
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,770
industrial property or intellectual property title

341
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,690
that blocks you

342
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,120
yes why not so much given the ownership of

343
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:38,220
that asset and your software  no okay yes

344
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:49,010
there are other questions

345
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,310
yes yes to stay talked to sodium

346
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,409
already little

347
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:02,589
I know

348
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,760
no

349
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,400
while jumping I can not say

350
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,530
if the pressing key math to have

351
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:22,580
players is actually the fact that

352
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,720
on theside of the

353
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,040
mysteries

354
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,850


355
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,080
we are the hardware

356
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,620
these  you leave united

357
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,950
no

358
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,130
one thing that I with xavi

359
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,260
exactly is a risk that you accept

360
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,909
that is when you go to take that asset

361
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:52,850
you know what it is going to face knows the risk that you

362
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,590
run not to have for example another

363
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,360
encrypted backup somewhere else

364
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,740
this is  another matter

365
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,840
the information then it is a different matter

366
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,928


367
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,700
that the problem brothers mercatone

368
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:26,110
not between you and the producer could also

369
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,169
have done a course to the producer and the

370
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:34,269
producer  has not informed you about the

371
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:35,889
concept of the internet and using the

372
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:38,740
internet to use the forums to

373
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,750
bother anyway also for

374
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,490
people to come various hack meetings

375
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,649
etc. it also serves to inform themselves to

376
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:45,940
understand

377
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,220
the case of fraudulent information can happen

378
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,389
however I

379
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,130
am both that it does me

380
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,149
how it does

381
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:04,210
this if the manufacturer does not know it

382
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,909
specifies but it is something else it does not fall

383
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:09,489
under the copyright does not fall within the

384
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:11,259
patentability it falls within the

385
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:15,129
customer information if it is a consumer market

386
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:19,570
if it is the business market it

387
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,119
is always necessary to the information but

388
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,429
we are talking to a professional

389
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:27,219
while in the consumer market to talk

390
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,809
as if there was a fool ahead of the times

391
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,249
so be very

392
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:32,609
clear

393
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,900
vital ppm

394
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,650
if

395
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,700
but the point is

396
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,370
cisco

397
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,130
one thing I had

398
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:03,890
if the sam producer published he

399
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,020
still explained what  makes its

400
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,880
product to the so-called datasheets more

401
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,730
does not have to tell you in the sense that it is you who afterwards

402
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,500
have to evaluate whether that product  to

403
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,190
that is, you have freedom of choice in the things you

404
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,560
understand and also in

405
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,610
the information if the information is not adequate,

406
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,930
the counter with the manufacturer will occur for a

407
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,840
certain reason then it is not done but it is a

408
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,420
different kettle of fish

409
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,190
but in theory you could do it if

410
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,660
he sold you one thing for another the

411
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,520
scam exists and is criminally prosecuted

412
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:44,230
understood but not

413
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,930
if I had to be a healthy kitchen

414
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:02,899
if something happens they will not let us

415
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,980
remain

416
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,650
a trace

417
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,610
but you

418
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,430
but knowing it you can choose

419
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,180
this

420
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,190
by doing the first alcohol tests

421
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:31,409
me  I know that that

422
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,330
card

423
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,180
gentlemen I have to stop you just enough is

424
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,210
enough
