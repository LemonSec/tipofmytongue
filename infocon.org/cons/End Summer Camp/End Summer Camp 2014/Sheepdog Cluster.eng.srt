1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
ok you all have experience some more some

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,899
less those virtual machines there is

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,309
no one who does not know what virtual machines are

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,139


5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,900
he ends ok very well he

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,109
saved me a bit of introductions so

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,660
first of all before explaining

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,850
what sheepdog is, I'll explain what it is not  chic

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,050
dog

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,320
we start from a pc or a server where

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,199
we run virtual machines

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,760
until our pc goes well in short

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,140
we have a disk if it breaks patience if it

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,320
is a server that we have on

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,129
customer data etc.

16
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,590
we must avoid that in case of failure

17
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,180
of a  disk let's talk about the data obviously

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,350
then what do

19
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,110
we do we put the disks in raid and this gives us

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,950
a bit of fault tolerance then however

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,600
what happens in a computer

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,280
other components can also break the hard

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,110
disks we know therefore to be a little more

24
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,059
delicate but we could fish

25
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,910
network the ram is worse than the whole

26
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,140
motherboard then what happens that maybe I

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,260
have a motherboard failure or my

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,430
laughs

29
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,400
maybe with controller and  I have to

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,439
physically move everything to

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,780
another motherboard you need another motherboard and restarting

32
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,040
it is not something that you do in five

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,759
minutes or if the backups of the day

34
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:21,990
before

35
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,180
do the backup stories put everything back on its

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,530
feet and go on

37
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,280
in short, we talk to each other like  they

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,020
say however however we have a time

39
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,470
of from a high in case of

40
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:41,280
hardware failure well another

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,170
solution is to say ok it

42
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,939
would be nice to be able to launch a

43
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,829
virtual machine on any server

44
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,930
instead currently we have said

45
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,060
relegated bound on those  disks that

46
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,680
are on to save them

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,240
then I could move them for example on the

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,860
nose a shared folder

49
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,189
simplifying in this way

50
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,250
simply a server dies I

51
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,259
start the machine the same

52
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,329
virtual machine so much the disk is shared by

53
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,399
another machine and my service

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,090
restarts practically instantly

55
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,030
time to simply start

56
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,190
it then this is a good solution

57
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,260
what the problem is anyway if i

58
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,099
s  i breaks the nas i'm all over again all

59
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,019
my front end servers become

60
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,660
useless so in my mind before i

61
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,340
stopped a server and i had those

62
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,810
virtual machines stopped now i

63
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,420
stop the storage or all the machines

64
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,870
stopped then how to do it right yes it does me the

65
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,870
redundancy among the nas which then will not be a

66
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:45,079
strange little smarter machine and therefore

67
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,880
a greater redundancy comes into play

68
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,700
and this picture is made for

69
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,620
example with rb of which a tool

70
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,579
that works well caused or in the company

71
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,660
that among other things we have  used for

72
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,819
example on quad core servers with 4gb

73
00:02:58,819 --> 00:02:59,390
of ram

74
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,480
we had two etc. it happened that

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,329
the motherboard broke one day I would have

76
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:07,819
died that act became primary

77
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:10,220
everything continued to work so I

78
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,329
can assure you that a good product

79
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:13,879
works but we have  two quad

80
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,100
core servers with a total of 8 gb say normal

81
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,150
that you turn your thumbs so there is a

82
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,680
hardware waste in this just

83
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,150
here they start talking about cig dog this

84
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,000
is the structure that we can  ò come to

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,760
mind this here on a slide among other things

86
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,290
I found on the official website they

87
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,359
used those monitors there to represent

88
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:37,400
the virtual machines they are not beautiful but in

89
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,380
any case they are virtual machines they are not

90
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,290
displays and we have a structure that

91
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,500
you can see equal to the difference

92
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,230
of  this where we have de salvo of the front

93
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,109
end and of the storage here each server does

94
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:53,480
the same thing it does both as a storage and as

95
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,440
a front end servant

96
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,260
what it means that the data is

97
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,480
simultaneously on all the servers and

98
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,639
the virtual machine can be launched

99
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,099
on any one  some sarvar as much as

100
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:07,669
if we had a shared storage this

101
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:11,840
here how does it all work because

102
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,079
you think gee but it's a raw file a

103
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:17,720
file sews a vmdk file which is a file

104
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,630
how can it be distributed on multiple

105
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,649
machines

106
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,470
then usually I do the analogy  of a

107
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,570
torrent file you all

108
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,020
know it torrent file what it does takes a

109
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,320
large file it splits it into chunk and you

110
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,500
downloaded chiang da from other peers to

111
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,320
other c  computer

112
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,479
the idea is practically the same we have

113
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:44,389
a large virtual disk point file

114
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:47,539
is broken up into what are

115
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:51,229
called object in in the case of the stream

116
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,630
less thematic even in the case of dogo

117
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,000
unless they are called object but the

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,729
concept is the same and are distributed

119
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:00,430
on the various  server

120
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,490
what is the problem with this you know

121
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,470
for example if you have a torrent that has

122
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,970
not downloaded completely that is, you

123
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,220
are missing pieces of file the file you

124
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,580
cannot use it ditto if you have a

125
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,960
virtual disk of a machine

126
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,030
even a small piece remains there

127
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,740
there is no information to have the

128
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,580
virtual machine disk

129
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,340
then for each there is also for each

130
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,240
object a second copy is made and it

131
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,889
is obviously distributed not in the

132
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:29,720
same way so for example a

133
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,240
piece puts the second copy on the first node

134
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,680
I don't look at it to put

135
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,750
on the same way the goal on

136
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,280
any of the others

137
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,229
in this way one dies the first node I

138
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:41,449
however the sky information does not  I

139
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:48,310
lost it ok now I go for a moment a little more

140
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,699
in detail how

141
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:54,860
sheepdog works this

142
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,349
I did it I simplified it a bit we have

143
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:02,150
qm ok bohemian kvm which makes some

144
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,560
requests to write to disk

145
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,900
I have to write something  in the disk of

146
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,690
the virtual machine the

147
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,210
write request is intercepted instead of

148
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,159
being taken by the linux kernel it is made

149
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:15,440
directly is taken is managed

150
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,310
by the web or blog driver and is

151
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,229
passed to a software the

152
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:23,599
software sheepdog sheepdog will

153
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:28,849
take care of breaking it up

154
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:31,789
distribute it and  then to say to which mou you

155
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:34,289
look I wrote I did

156
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:37,289
and in this way we have the

157
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:38,759
redundancy we need

158
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,710
on more nodes we have another component

159
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,689
which is what you see in the center that the

160
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:46,710
cluster manager

161
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,159
the cluster manager is the guardian

162
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,619
let's say so is that  who notices you

163
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:55,649
are a node is alive and dead sheepdog of

164
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:59,249
passion does not when it does we have

165
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:01,680
a cluster manager who can be Zucchi

166
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,409
for or can  to be choir singh there are

167
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,300
also others but these are the two

168
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,379
that are used the most that notify for

169
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:19,680
example if this dies the cluster

170
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,839
manager who runs on these here

171
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,839
notices it alerts them and they take

172
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,449
actions what does it mean if this had

173
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,589
we do  fake 50gb of small pieces

174
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:33,270
tells him look the one of the is no longer

175
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,999
active there are 50 gb of small pieces he

176
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:38,159
asks that they are missing then the others

177
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,629
begin to replicate each other

178
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:41,550
in such a way that there are always at least

179
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:49,199
two copies of each piece this is

180
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,689
a scheme of  what I have just

181
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:54,120
explained to you this precisely the

182
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,819
representation of a file where the

183
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,589
risk of the virtual machine is

184
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:04,589
divided into blocks of four megs each

185
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,670
square

186
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:11,380
would be this this let's say

187
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,310
square examples show me the parts

188
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,410
that are really written this is

189
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,450
this second today  this and more

190
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,480
this is a cross there is one where

191
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,940
there are no written parts where

192
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,800
we simply have a part of the disc that is not

193
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,650
allocated sheepdog crafty enough of

194
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,720
that there I am not going to lease the

195
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,299
space I do not know if you have experience when

196
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,070
you do unallocated allocated disks

197
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,750
you can make a disk even from three ground

198
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,750
on a disk of 500 yes yes

199
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,090
virtual space 3 tare  as long as

200
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,770
physically there is no write 3 land of

201
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,870
data you are not filling that space

202
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,320
there and therefore this is my list of

203
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:00,070
objects I have three and it shows that the

204
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,640
block

205
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,270
the block device is represented

206
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:10,450
in this way here by myself  I said

207
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,020
for simplicity the speech of two copies

208
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,110
ok because they are easier to understand but if

209
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,340
we have 50 machines, a hundred machines

210
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,960
can happen that more than one machine dies

211
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,770


212
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,890
in the same period of time, like an hour

213
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,870
from each other or even two hours  one

214
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,300
from the other

215
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,190
if it happens I do not miss it

216
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,960
I miss too much data I can no

217
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,630
longer get information and therefore the

218
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,960
cluster should stop

219
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,280
then what happens may decide to

220
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,560
increase the redundancy I say ok for each

221
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,690
piece  o don't make me two copies hungry the

222
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,780
three families four families 5 what

223
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,240
I decide obviously the more the redundancy increases the

224
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,900
lower the performances

225
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,550
because it takes longer to write

226
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,520
describes more things it takes longer and

227
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,980
the default redundancy

228
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,290
when you do a sheepdog cluster is  of three

229
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,110
couples that for me is already quite

230
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,460
high are three copies it

231
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,040
means that at least 3 sarvar can

232
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,420
die one with five men at

233
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,380
any time

234
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,170
nor can a second die so much

235
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,579
Sardinian parons burst this what

236
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,029
it also means sibello but it also takes me

237
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:27,160
away a lot  space in short if we think of

238
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,110
a gathering that eats me an entire disk

239
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,290
this would be a raid 1 plus 1 hopefully

240
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,120
used sum so it takes away a lot of

241
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,510
space then they thought they

242
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,970
added quite recently it seems to me

243
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,550
nine months in short not a lot is a

244
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,639
new feature that is called  he was on his

245
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,980
shield man that slide you see little

246
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:56,769
you can see better these two here are red

247
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:01,209
you can hardly see here on the monitor they hang

248
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,269
one of  these blocks

249
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:07,600
ok which is four mega and if you

250
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,350
tell me for example these 4 mag amelie dvd

251
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,709
in four then you make me 4 pieces from

252
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:17,740
one emili scattered on four

253
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,170
different machines obviously at that moment it says

254
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,699
a machine dies or I pass all

255
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:24,760
my data  but I tell him then you make me

256
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,130
two more pieces of redundancy and you put me

257
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,570
on two other servers those neely pieces

258
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,230
of redundancy allow me to

259
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,820
lose even two nodes

260
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,860
at the same time example just

261
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,740
these two or all the information one

262
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,730
of these recovery from one of these here

263
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,140
however  in this way I use much less

264
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,430
space and I can how to say I can

265
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,360
decide this level of

266
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,600
redundancy is not necessarily 4 and 2 it can

267
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:05,440
be 8 and 18 and 38 thought of c5 so

268
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,470
this maybe a little specific but if

269
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,569
it is not a very thing  very interesting

270
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:14,440
because a raid 6 is exactly

271
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,519
equivalent to a raid 6

272
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,209
if instead we do for example 2 and 1 it is

273
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:21,069
the equivalent of a radi 5

274
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:23,170
but I repeat we do it more widely  or

275
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:23,840
we have

276
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,260
100 machines I could decide to do 8 and

277
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,230
38 and 5 in short, very interesting this

278
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,970
thing well let's go on

279
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,060
here it is practically the same scheme as

280
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,310
before with some more details

281
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,080
above you see represented the cluster

282
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,430
manager called coro sync here we have

283
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,950
represented the virtual machines  to the

284
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,960
processes, however, they write

285
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,610
these have intercepted it from what is

286
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,880
called gateway in the specific

287
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,160
language of sip dog the gateway

288
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,180
speaks to the other sheepdog servants and

289
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,640
distributes them the olive data to take

290
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:13,160
they need fair there is all this is

291
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,390
a web command that  launch a normal file let's

292
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,790
call it so that it is nothing more

293
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,070
than a cook file at 2 could be

294
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,830
medicated

295
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,480
the syntax changes very little I

296
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,030
just have to say sheepdog colon and the name

297
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,970
of yesterday's tv v is not a file that you

298
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,240
see you can manage it  see the list of

299
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,460
disks I created and via a

300
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,900
command that we will soon see as good

301
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,390
as starting the sheepdog daemon

302
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,460
once  installed I can launch it even

303
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,220
without arguments and he goes to use a

304
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,560
default directory but the best thing in

305
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,030
fact I say fundamental is to

306
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,660
launch the command giving the dough a

307
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,420
mount point so that we have

308
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,300
a device dedicated to the city at least one

309
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,040
device

310
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,510
this instead  it is a more real example

311
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,640
where we have the daemon that is

312
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,230
launched that the enne option used

313
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,980
to increase performance uses the

314
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,800
first folder for metadata and this

315
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,060
instead is a hand point touch a

316
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,040
separate device then here I

317
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,540
refer to a cluster manager  which is

318
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,580
different from the sync chorus I tell him which

319
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,010
nodes actually have to

320
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,210
communicate with each other which are the

321
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,670
guardians in quotation marks and over all

322
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,560
here I said ok I have my sarno there is a

323
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,400
network card

324
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,490
dedicated to the sheepdog input output traffic

325
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,600
what does it want  say I receive data

326
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,360
over the network on a virtual machine no

327
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,280
they pass me through an interface that

328
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,770
has a bridge and are written to

329
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,100
disk when I  a node stops

330
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,330
in short, something happens

331
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,520
the missing data is replicated

332
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,130
so it means that there is a

333
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,690
data passage between the nodes and this can

334
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,940
slow me down the virtual machines gives us back

335
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,030
a dedicated network interface

336
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,010
here is that all this data passage does not work

337
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,720
to affect the

338
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,250
performance of the virtual machines less than

339
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,320
you can black on a

340
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,150
separate switch so I do not even go to clean

341
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,850
the network traffic of the dl of the whole

342
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,230
network of my data center

343
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,590
here before I was telling you for example to

344
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,370
see the dvd that is the disks

345
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,380
I have in my cluster I use this command

346
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,730
here dog means dog vdi list and it is

347
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,170
quite intuitive it is not that the front

348
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,260
dog withheld tina or not a bbb dopu of

349
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,440
liszt dog cluster info for example it gives me

350
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,420
information on cluster dog cluster

351
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:52,340
format from  only it makes me redundant with

352
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,100
the three couples you use this belt you

353
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,590
say you use the reasons me dvd

354
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,370
pieces in two

355
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,500
you make me one of redundancy which is

356
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,670
the equivalent of a ra  id 5 dog we

357
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,710
beautiful shows how many nodes there

358
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,210
are they also tell me their

359
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,750
ip address this is how I create a

360
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,960
virgin woody so I start from a cluster

361
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,310
I want to create an

362
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,690
empty virtual machine disk new this command here

363
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,600
that even this intuitive

364
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,070
does not  they are a thousand and one dashes to be used by

365
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,300
woody straight to erase a disc it is

366
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,590
very interesting thing

367
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,780
I can make snapshots to make more

368
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,690
dvd snapshots at different times

369
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,600
then there is another string but I

370
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,570
save money and from we play we talk a little

371
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,390
more about the dc9 features

372
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,880
well in the meantime it is a free free

373
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,550


374
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:56,430
software project open source is hosted on github

375
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,649
its features are auto

376
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,360
disconnect of disks when there is

377
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,010
an error

378
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,540
what does this mean for us we can

379
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,099
work without having a hardware raid controller

380
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,189
we can not even need it

381
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:09,990
use mini media to make me a king of

382
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,010
software

383
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,380
I give him the devices dough when a

384
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,449
device starts giving the accused terror

385
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:18,540
he unhooks it from the dal  cluster and

386
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,349
replicates missing copies authors

387
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,420
balancing data

388
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,069
dies me the nodule automatically

389
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,510
replicates the data to me those that have been

390
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,120
lost on that world there authors

391
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,660
web ship connection for any

392
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,730
reason for a moment

393
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,450
what happens that mou is no longer able to

394
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,640
talk to the demon ship because the

395
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,929
machine is busy with

396
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:47,490
anything whatever as soon as they manage to

397
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,370
communicate again with each other as if

398
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,170
nothing had happened and he continues

399
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,970
while the previous versions what

400
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,280
happened the machine was used and

401
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,210
you had to kill it kill it and relaunch

402
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,860
it it happened to me  recent among other things that

403
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,590
for a switch problem it is one of the nodes

404
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,030
but top time it was released from the others

405
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:12,870
by itself then it came back and continued

406
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,059
to work in short without even

407
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,419
needing my intervention was

408
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,280
snapshot plus roll back for easy

409
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,809
snapshots can  go back also the

410
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,880
state of the snapshot incremental backups

411
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,080
we have our virtual ones

412
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,520
here there is a snapshot or  days untied

413
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,710
tomorrow move the backup

414
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,200
of the entire virtual disk example 50gb

415
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,750
between yesterday and today have changed into gb of

416
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,970
data faces incremental backups you

417
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,169
put me on 1 gb of data

418
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:43,140
I can then do the complete restore

419
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,220
of the file made initially I add

420
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,429
the increase  and I'm okay so without

421
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,580
putting away the whole make backups

422
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,700
at cluster level every time

423
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,860
this is convenient if instead of copying

424
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,290
12 risks of skins the virtual brands

425
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,490
I want to do it of the entire cluster

426
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,220
plus it does it in a clever way

427
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,150
using deduplication and therefore space  it

428
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,040
takes up less space deduplication means

429
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,390
that for example on the same object it is

430
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,340
used several times it is just one mind away

431
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,490
several times you put it only once and

432
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,080
then re-uses it when I want to make

433
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,490
stories to support excavations that non-

434
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,060
standard very used level

435
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,740
redundancy as explained above can be

436
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,530
decided by the administrator if I

437
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,660
need more space for more servers

438
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,460
just add them and he

439
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,320
automatically s  Iri data balances or

440
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,210
new machines available to

441
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,380
launch virtual machines this email

442
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,860
received this morning integrated today

443
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,940
in the slides because now we have seen

444
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,530
let's say a little finished the technical part I

445
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,180
talk to you a little more about the history

446
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,950
of the project of the current state of those

447
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,880
who follow it  of those who do not follow the

448
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,750
founder let's say that the project a

449
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,470
few months that does not follow him anymore and there is

450
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,180
another muntain and then I asked

451
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,100
him please to give me some information

452
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,600
because I intend to make a

453
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,840
wikipedia page and I asked him why

454
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,600
the project was born and he answers me

455
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,370
because oh well if the oo.ss based as in

456
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,150
parma twas and take them and stage the time

457
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,710
practically there was no software

458
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,940
that did this open stuff

459
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,250
then his company started to

460
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,510
develop

461
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:39,280
it I don't know if  do you know or for star chef chef

462
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,800
he will make us do the same thing as sheepdog

463
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,110
are two parallel projects

464
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,550
initially I had also tried a little

465
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,170
chat I did not find myself so well

466
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,610
at  now or a little more this

467
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,360
project is perhaps a little more mature I have to

468
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,680
say this but I have not tried it very

469
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,330
much so I do not put it so it can

470
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:05,440
certainly be

471
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,950
a platform

472
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,890
here this is I have not tried it that

473
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:27,500
much  so you know maybe you

474
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,370
do not know or for the fs it is a file system

475
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,629
this thing you are talking about

476
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:49,499
90

477
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,750
I did not know this there is another

478
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,870
that now the name blue star escapes me

479
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,100
a rooster fs

480
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,810
here are anyway this is not  it is a

481
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,060
file system rif he was born to do

482
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,520
abstraction of a block device for

483
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:21,240
poems then in reality we are there to put it

484
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,240
with iss cases you can also use it with

485
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,880
another kernel module that was

486
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,910
created a few months ago which should

487
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,410
be a bit  more performing this cases

488
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,840
but the concept is the same you have a daemon

489
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:42,050
is an attack client

490
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,570
you will practically feel it in devices cases

491
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,830
you mount it

492
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:51,030
then there is the nbd one which therefore has

493
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,560
holes then mount for example a

494
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,850
spoon but then mount a  disk dog and

495
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,930
then there is also ship ss instead of using

496
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,610
a liti syntax mount one of the

497
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,800
partitions of the virtual disk what

498
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,710
you want it was still a little bit so I don't

499
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,460
spend more than many words on it

500
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,990
then I asked him but it was your project

501
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,820
or a commissioned project

502
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,650
from your company he replied that

503
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,900
the company he commissioned is called

504
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:26,520
ntt lab to ask but why

505
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,110
did you start creating this new

506
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,080
storage solution he says that rb point

507
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,480
of excess were not at the beginning

508
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,320
too the first people involved in the

509
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,870
project were he  that pumpkin kazutaka

510
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,710
morita and tomonori that is what

511
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,380
should be the current maintainer of the

512
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,880
target iss case and oh well then he tells me about the

513
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,190
pun practically the name

514
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,650
of the project that sheepdog where the sheep

515
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,800
are the

516
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,890
servers and then there is the dog that  that of the command

517
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,640
that what the minister

518
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:11,090
here are the references the excursion page well

519
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,390
surely where you find everything everything here

520
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,920
there is the whole project there is the wiki I

521
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,470
know  there is no documentation there is the

522
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:23,840
source code there is the master branch master which

523
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,730
in my opinion can be seen a bit like

524
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,810
the beta ok the patches and you find them there but

525
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,140
they may not have been tested and then there is

526
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,700
the version instead  stable that

527
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,400
downloaded it in tar.gz format and the stable

528
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,260
in short, like all stable not

529
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,060
new things, new things are not put

530
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,410
in the strip, however, bugfixes are brought back

531
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,520
and then there is instead

532
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,070
sheepdog turkey project point jorge è

533
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,100
a showcase site so it's not so much

534
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,080
aimed at programmers it's under

535
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,790
development

536
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,620
I'm trying to get some

537
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,910
stuff on it but there is already a

538
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,120
sheepdog manual I wrote it is quite

539
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,280
complete just in the manual there is no one

540
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,520
heart spoke of the redundancy

541
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,690
was circus of but the only thing missing is

542
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,860
fundamental the mailing lists there are two

543
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,460
developers and user I always write on the

544
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,170
user so the developer also read it

545
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,670
so and then yes of that other that

546
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:32,150
of the developers this or that  of

547
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,680
which I am  o I am mainly involved

548
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,210
in the project I am not a programmer

549
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,900
I know a little bit about it but not that much

550
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,850
testing testing and bagarella reporting

551
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,300
that is very important and I have

552
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,260
found it in short or that it is but all

553
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,790
projects when in short they are always

554
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,850
development cheaters then we have

555
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,990
tried in mind in a production environment,

556
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,600
not an example, we

557
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,070
ran the virtual machines of the

558
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,680
customers upstairs, just loaded giga and

559
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,360
giga of data every night and see

560
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,240
how it behaved then we

561
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,830
put stress in an environment just after

562
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,650


563
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,770
not being  simple test in two fi test on 5

564
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,860
gigabytes by rob suggested several

565
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,730
features

566
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,370
two stupid examples when he launches vi do

567
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,640
cluster format tac he did it

568
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,020
independently if the class was

569
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,620
populated no maybe a tired one writes from the

570
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,510
cluster format speaks everything in a second

571
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,360
without even giving the  confirmation in ten

572
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,350
minutes but made peace and a mass

573
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,110
another example recently added is

574
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,720
the woody l  ocking so there is a

575
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,320
virtual machine is using a disk on one node

576
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,880
a virtual machine on another node

577
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,640
cannot use it same disk

578
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,370
until recently yes and this was spitting on you the

579
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,340
disk they put vdi locking and I

580
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,380
realized that however if  the woody was

581
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,660
blocked he could still do v he says that

582
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,670
a kind of spelling which should not have

583
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,430
been done and I reported it and they

584
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,760
also fixed what I then did

585
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,750
two parallel projects one is called

586
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,320
due to a simple beige writes that

587
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,020
I download i  midi sources compiles and

588
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,560
helps me to configure it without knowing much

589
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,330
about the configuration

590
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,640
files syntax of the configuration files and

591
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,450
then another vm design here that

592
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,460
instead of launching a handwritten or

593
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,420
practically a

594
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,280
complete virtual machine configuration file I

595
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,080
start this machine not  I tell

596
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,420
him where he manages to get it started on

597
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,550
any node, for example, he checks

598
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,530
if there are the necessary resources and

599
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,540
maybe he also shows me the  good and 5

600
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,560
therefore a parallel thing that integrates

601
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:56,370
with sheepdog this is a criticism that

602
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,010
I can make to the project now is that

603
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,590
precisely if you go see you not

604
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:04,650
as developers or expert users but

605
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,650
one who does not know anything goes to see the

606
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,960
page of  gita bank did not immediately have

607
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,690
an idea of what the project is, how it

608
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,410
works, what its qualities are

609
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,050
and so I would like to try to give

610
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,690
this information more easily for

611
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,280
non-expert users and this translates

612
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,800
into the creation of the site

613
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,300
we have seen  first sheepdog between up to

614
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,220
project point org

615
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,800
I would like to collect information it can

616
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,060
be a useful thing to create a

617
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,250
foundation because sincerely you always

618
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,810
hear about the mozilla foundation

619
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,550
of the free software foundation of the

620
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,060
peace fondation they are organizations

621
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,700
that carry out their software

622
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,810
then I would be curious to understand if  it is also

623
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,880
possible to create a foundation

624
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,160
for this project and how to

625
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,470
look for maintainers to create the

626
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,850
pa  cchi packages of the various

627
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:03,460
distributions fedora percent on debian

628
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,360
media is already boom to

629
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,710
etc. integration in cloud meaning that it is very

630
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:12,550
used integration of prox mox that

631
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,950
we have already done in part but

632
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,550
only as fiscal targets

633
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,580
the real site just mentioned

634
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,570
update publication of

635
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,550
documentation so far  I created a

636
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,180
manual and added a small article on the

637
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,060
wiki and in my opinion it is a very useful thing

638
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,430
then if the creation of screencasts then

639
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:38,440
a video where you practically show us

640
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,050
what you do specifically is by no means

641
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,330
just a presentation that

642
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,060
shows just how  a cluster is initialised

643
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,460
and as a virtual machine is born

644
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,380
it enrolls in something it

645
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,370
is relaunched elsewhere

646
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,499
the wikipedia page that I told you

647
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,710
before,

648
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,610
here I thank you and if

649
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,070
someone wants to help me in

650
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,220
collecting this information knows

651
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,389
people who  I'm a

652
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:15,519
package maintainer or who knows other people

653
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,769
they know if they give me some counts

654
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:23,110
I would be very grateful to you and last thing

655
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,480
this is my test cluster are two

656
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,019
very nice hp mini servers that

657
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:32,409
carry small drawers and then

658
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:34,119
instead these here are

659
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:37,720
monthly coupons so on the fly with some intel atom and

660
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,049
two gigabit network cards are

661
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:44,350
processors  low consumption but to

662
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,059
do my tests on more than enough

663
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,990
questions

664
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:00,410
the traffic to sell

665
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:03,040
thanks

666
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,770
depends on the level of redundancy you

667
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:16,150
use then keep in mind that when you

668
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,590
write something you

669
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,510
describe a part of the local it prevents a

670
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,520
part from sending it to others

671
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,110
wishing it could still have  a node

672
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,970
that is that your only what it means

673
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,210
without disks that everything that writes

674
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,970
it sends it to the network on the others in this

675
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,290
example takes this example because it is

676
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,630
easier to understand your channel is that

677
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,780
of the network card so a gigabit

678
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,110
if you do  two copies perons write

679
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,250
your write speed is

680
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,640
halved so it's a gigabit divided by two

681
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,430
if you make three copies it's a gigabit divided between

682
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,730
then  go on 30 mag per second on the

683
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,760
contrary never on 50 60 megabytes per

684
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,060
second instead with node it is normal with

685
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,330
sata disks equal impact even aci more

686
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,210
because it is a userspace process so they

687
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,280
impact a little more but I have

688
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,900
then seen values reach  between 80

689
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,140
90 megs per second and with powerful machines it

690
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,060
can go even further

691
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,960
I speak with two copies so it can

692
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,250
vary a lot but good here do not

693
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,290
forget the hyphen n option for the

694
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:26,710
senses do not use with the option there he does not

695
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,990
use any type of  cache not even the

696
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,670
disk cache so as long as

697
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,630
it has not written on the metal it does not say ok

698
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,850
I am done it is a little yes used nfs

699
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,130
essentially the sync option is to be

700
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,080
shot in the mood and very slow

701
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,870
of a virtual disk you ask me a good

702
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,590
question

703
00:32:51,590 --> 00:33:00,260
though  I think we are talking about petabytes also I

704
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,810
have seen that they were talking about a thousand

705
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,110
knots

706
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,930
these things I do not know how to answer you in case

707
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:20,260
apples sign and I investigate this on

708
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,030
this question here that may be

709
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,629
interesting

710
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,790
companions

711
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,440
yes an

712
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:47,429
integer  rface you say yes this was born it was

713
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:49,710
born just for openstack but

714
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,360
personally there is still no hand

715
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,340
for stark so I can't tell you but

716
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,570
this point has other features

717
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,399
that is not even mentioned precisely

718
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:02,399
that it supports the openstack amazon protocols

719
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,799
I recommend you go  to

720
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:14,040
read on the site it should be a

721
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,040
great openstack cool but staying one

722
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,929
level a little further back also prox

723
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:23,520
mox a very nice distribution eh

724
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,949
already it is already in short he fully gr

725
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:29,310
with the excavations but you can do here on

726
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,069
which juice on this need here me

727
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:34,168
at work I created the vm

728
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:35,609
clip because in fact I had broken my

729
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:37,619
balls to do so many times if it

730
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,540
sticks to launch the scripts here or

731
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,460
to see the good and remind me of the

732
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,109
channel the display on which the

733
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:44,760
virtual machine

734
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,750
is  created that little cliche

735
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,679
in short, quick to do these jobs

736
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,659
I have not tried it on hundreds of no

737
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,300
hundreds of nodes but I think you

738
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,790
try it on 5 6 nodes it was fine

739
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,430
probably up to about ten 20 nodes

740
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,410
go then it is also convenient that

741
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,619
just technically but there where

742
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:10,190
the developers are asked to

743
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:22,830
share a file share a know

744
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:28,250
that there is multi paties cases if it was ok

745
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,610
but that is another thing that is you have

746
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,930
two virtual macrì that need

747
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,529
a shared story

748
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:52,349
ah I understand I understand what the question is

749
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:55,900
for example a template machine and

750
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,819
above it is above that I want to launch

751
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:00,150
more instances

752
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,760
of this I can't answer you I

753
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,490
can't tell you this I can't tell you this  for

754
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,490
example I created my windows windows 7

755
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:25,550
or configured it with a web server

756
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,599
whatever I want I take a

757
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,250
snapshot I make the clones of the snap

758
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,670
shot the anci the virtual machines

759
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,570
as long as they do not start to write

760
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,849
has not taken up any more space

761
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:38,220
not  now I have not replicated the disk n times

762
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,369
yes I know if this thing can be useful

763
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:43,619
but let's talk about that

764
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:52,910
thing there else ok thanks
