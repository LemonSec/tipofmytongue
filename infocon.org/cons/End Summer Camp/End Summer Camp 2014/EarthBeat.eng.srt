1
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:06,240
well hello everyone i am aias someone

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,429
saw me yesterday i am also part

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,050
of the space of gorizia are the guys

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,840
who work there and today i will introduce you

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,580
a little what we have done one of the

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,350
projects that we have done that

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,420
we have also brought  at the mega fair in

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,460
rome and it's called and it's a seismometer

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,810
let's start let's start a little from the beginning

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,590
because one wonders why then

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,820
our goal was to create a

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,610
simple but still interesting project capable

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,800
of catching people's attention a little in

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,919


15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,090
order to be  even a minimum useful

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,309
maybe a minimum interesting

17
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,690
the idea that there was a

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,850
seismograph yes because a seismograph

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,149
because a basic seismograph is a

20
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,860
rather simple thing is a mechanism for

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,160
simple theft there is a move that oscillates

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,120
there is a  way of measuring these

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,719
oscillations

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,320
everything here is then complicated and

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,369
perfected but let's say the

26
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,240
basic concept is this then what is a seismometer

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,090
or a seismograph practically it is a measuring

28
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,130
instrument  sura that measures the

29
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,960
displacement of the ground in a

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,970
precise direction because in a precise direction

31
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,540
because there are more types of seismic waves

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,960
and we are interested in knowing what kind of

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,530
seismic wave we are measuring those

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,939
mechanical ones that are the

35
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,820
old generation let's say physically measure the

36
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,890
displacement of the ground  the

37
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,430


38
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,869
electronic ones are instead the speed of

39
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,460
displacement or the acceleration of

40
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,990
displacement of displacement

41
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,909
the eti also accelerometers which however

42
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:42,960
have nothing to do with the

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,119
accelerometers we have in our

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,890
devices as like all things

45
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,880
seismographs resonate are a

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,710
simple model  it is the same as that of a rlc

47
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,310
i.e. a

48
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,100
damped oscillation but you have to

49
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,390
be careful of the

50
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,040
resonant frequency the resonance frequency is the

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,210
one that gives you then sets where the

52
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,550
waves will be more amplified for that

53
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,260
when you see seismographs that have

54
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,540
long arms and for  have

55
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,090
low and resonant frequencies and therefore resonate

56
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,819
better to incoming waves  or let's start

57
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,650
with a history climb the seismograph

58
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,300
is nothing new it was invented

59
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,880
by a chinese astronomer zhang gang

60
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,030
in 20 100 years before 2100 years ago

61
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,350
the modern one was invented very

62
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,260
recently compared to two thousand years

63
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,319
ago in 1892 which is always mechanical

64
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,299
while the electric electromagnetic one

65
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:45,310
was invented at the beginning of the

66
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,230
last century by a Russian prince

67
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,390
let's talk a little about seismic waves I state

68
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,000
that it is not my field I am

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,370
a physicist but I can talk a little

70
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,989
about seismic waves there are more types

71
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:01,090
as you can see on  the pin da esse

72
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,850
lover haley the waves pls are the most

73
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,130
common ones which are pressure

74
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,500
waves and share waves

75
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,530
let's talk about them let's see them in detail they

76
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,090
are volume waves so they don't travel

77
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,290
on the surface they can't travel

78
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,630
even inside the earth let's say the

79
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,319
waves p are oscillations

80
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,970
in this sense along the

81
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,450
wave propagation if we look for example

82
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,709
here we see a little bit practically

83
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,750
the  'wave propagates so these are

84
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,700
the compression fronts and here there is an

85
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,160
extension while the s wave that you can

86
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,010
see here are oscillations say

87
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,840
perpendicular to the direction of

88
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,590
propagation so either vertically or

89
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,150
horizontally or any combination

90
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,750
of the two obviously leon  of the

91
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,209
rayleigh log waves are well we can

92
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,079
see them here they are of ground roll the rae

93
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,269
lee are therefore practically the ground

94
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,160
that makes a movement so they are both

95
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,540
surface waves but then they

96
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,980
propagate only on the

97
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,250
earth's surface let's say

98
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,560
then a hard disk let's talk about it

99
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,200
can be  it may seem a bit

100
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,420
so silly thing to do but thinking about it for a

101
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,840
moment a hard disk and in the end a

102
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,950
very precise tool because in short,

103
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,630
to move to move destiny and I

104
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,250
would search for all the data it

105
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,430
needs a very very precise drive

106
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,140
so it can also be a  very good

107
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,960
measuring system to its bearings which

108
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,450
are very precise maximum friction without

109
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,220
problems very little magnets  try with the

110
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,620
coil inside to drive them

111
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,110
precisely check

112
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,060
our idea of using them

113
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,980
practically in the opposite way, that is,

114
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,460
using the actuator as a sensor and

115
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,080
then measuring the induced current to

116
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,000
the coil instead of supplying

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,300
current by doing the first trivial tests with

118
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,860
a copy silos  we have seen that the

119
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,980
signal that comes out is quite

120
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,730
strong enough we are talking about 50 60 thousand times peak to

121
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,700
peak and therefore we decided to go

122
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,230
ahead

123
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,250
so we fixed an

124
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,780
inertial mass to the actuator arm of

125
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,570
the heads we measure the induced current at the

126
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,280
ends of the coil in the moment  in which the

127
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,490
inertial mass moves or I pepper more

128
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,710
precisely the whole world that

129
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,180
moves around the inertial mass which

130
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,300
tends to be stationary we measure a

131
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,120
current because the arm moves the

132
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,590
magnetic field changes then we measure

133
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,570
an induced current we made a

134
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,960
shield  for the first prototype that does

135
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,420
nothing more than a second low pass

136
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,850
filter  from second order to filter

137
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,770
the high frequencies that are unwanted

138
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,660
in the field

139
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,740
of seismometers to let's say let's amplify

140
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,770
a bit let's do the appropriate byas for

141
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,500
sampling with a wine obviously

142
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,020
10-bit sampling is a great

143
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,240
depth but for a prototype it

144
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,210
worked fine and then  we do

145
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,450
nothing but send us the

146
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,760
packaged commands let's say to the computer and

147
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,110
then unpack it with a script in

148
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,370
python that we did using

149
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,130
math rock tv and in a couple

150
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,980
this was a but a beautiful experience

151
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,930
also because it was the first

152
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,550
contact a bit  more serious with python

153
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,640
than ours of our people we say

154
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,800
and it is absurd how much packets of with a

155
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,990
pair and matt lipsey facilitate the work

156
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,040
with contacts also beautiful heavy

157
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,340
sft in real time live without big

158
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,850
problems and this is the emoticon process

159
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,160
we had  as you can see here is

160
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,480
the shift in real time and here there

161
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,250
is no spectrum on this but there is

162
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,230
the practical acceleration  nte derived

163
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,970
by making the derivative of the signal

164
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,160
then then we presented this first prototype

165
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,080
to the maker faire

166
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,800
we also won them a best maker award

167
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,540
and therefore we liked it very much

168
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,400
they had decided to think about it a little

169
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,700
longer because ours was the first

170
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,200
prototype it was a serious problem to

171
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,640
set the working point that is the

172
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,260
point around which the head then oscillated

173
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,720
we used rubber bands

174
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,610
obviously this thing here is unthinkable

175
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,070
for a measuring instrument and

176
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,020
therefore we decided to explore

177
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,600
the various options that  we had

178
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,540
the various possible options to overcome

179
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,120
this problem of elastic

180
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,710
damping with springs damping in

181
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,540
oil magnetic landslides but

182
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,490
we did not like all this very much because

183
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,550
it was not really something they did not recycle

184
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,930
enough things see this was a

185
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,420
project that was designed

186
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,340
above all to demonstrate  also to the

187
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,740
people that maybe things have disk and it will

188
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,700
break

189
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,470
if you throw it  you throw it away and if not then

190
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,860
I do the seismograph so the

191
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,660
big idea was to use the

192
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,060
optical module of a cd player and here I imagine

193
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,040
a reaction similar to that of using

194
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,240
a hard disk for a seismograph [ __ ] ok no

195
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,000
not so truth not  it is so it is not so

196
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,370
absurd because the optical module

197
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,080
obviously needs to know if the

198
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,960
laser is focused on the cd let's say I

199
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,640
don't know if you know how the

200
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,200
reading principle works practically there is a

201
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,300
laser beam that is reflected or not from

202
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,280
the rigid surface  but since the traces are

203
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,630
very very thin

204
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,500
I am talking about

205
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,860
6 micrometers 8 micrometers thickness of

206
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,330
a trace the laser point must be

207
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,490
rather fine otherwise I will

208
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,730
also read the neighboring traces and therefore there is a

209
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,210
signal that comes out of the pic that we say

210
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,979
the module that  then takes care of reading the

211
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,370
data and what the incoming laser reads

212
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,090
let's say that it is called a focus

213
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:46,230
error is practically

214
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,440
proportional to the distance between the

215
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,220
lens and a surface that reflects  tte therefore

216
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,630
our idea was was to

217
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,740
use this is precisely this

218
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,300
signal

219
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,460
obviously the documentation on the fact

220
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,430
diode integrated circuit is practically

221
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,990
absent because it is a part that is

222
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,450
developed only for enterprise

223
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,660
let's say and therefore has no marking

224
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,350
nothing

225
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,260
the only one the  the only thing was to count the

226
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,150
number of pins and look for all the datasheets

227
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,860
of all bayern photos that could be

228
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,390
found on the internet and

229
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,240
first of all sift through the number of pins and then

230
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,800
try to guess the usual

231
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,940
reverse engineering techniques

232
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,089
guess the limitation to ground

233
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,040
proceed from there in fact  at the end we have

234
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,650
burned a lot so how does

235
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,320
the focus error focus I was here there will be

236
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,250
the only formula it was good a

237
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,770
focus I was practically inserting a

238
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,110
lens and walked tico in the return of the

239
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,420
laser let's say an astigmatic lens is inserted

240
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,700
this stigmatic lens a

241
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,180
it distorts the point which

242
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,620
normally horrified the laser round around

243
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,110
the laser leaves however

244
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,380
let's say a cylinder reflects on it tightens arrives

245
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,810
the cd reflects down it widens again and then

246
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,510
there is this astigmatic lens

247
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,400
that tightens it from one side or the other

248
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,440
I hope you do not see you do not see

249
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,720
anything

250
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,540
so what do we do  we make 44

251
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,510
detectors 4 photodiodes placed in a square in the

252
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,089
shape of a window, let's say

253
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:23,519
and then we measure the difference between the two

254
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,220
between the two diagonals let's say and this

255
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,870
difference will be precisely the focus I am mistaken

256
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,269
because when the lens is perfectly in

257
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:32,399
focus the signal and return to circulate

258
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,050
on the 4  and then goes to

259
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,480
symmetrically affect the four out of four

260
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,029
photodiodes while you are out of focus on one

261
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:42,360
side or the other yes yes yes

262
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,410
practically squeezes on one side or the other

263
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:53,160
so making a break up creating a

264
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,930
seismometer can be quite easy

265
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,660
the little room  expensive that in the end

266
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,149
counting the first prototype

267
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:03,930
we made it with about a

268
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,790
little less than a hundred euros because

269
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,809
we decided to choose

270
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:12,749
amplifiers  a little nicer gold you learn a

271
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:15,089
lot because even working on it I

272
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,829
learned really a lot

273
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:18,990
starting from python ending with reverse

274
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,269
engineering photodiodes and therefore it can

275
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:22,949
be something that then can very well

276
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:26,660
be proposed also to schools

277
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,249
going back a little I see that I have

278
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:32,040
been a little bit  too fast I can

279
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,399
also explain the future steps a little better,

280
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,139
let's say about the second prototype that

281
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,839
we intend to present also

282
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,839
at this year's maker faire in rome

283
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,579
practically ours our goal in

284
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,429
this case is to use a bid there is an

285
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:51,249
integrative derivative proportional controller

286
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:54,879
to then drive a mass in such a

287
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,529
way that it always remains stationary

288
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:59,229
let's say and therefore in the moment in which

289
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:01,919
the wave arrives our inertial mass

290
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,359
tends to move the hard disk lever a little

291
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,529
and therefore we compensate by

292
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,549
actively piloting this time

293
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:15,459
using the arm as  actuator

294
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,039
and no longer as a sensor by piloting it a little by

295
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,600
moving it a little forward

296
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,889
or  Obviously the signal we

297
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:24,459
use to drive it will then be the

298
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:26,949
seismic signal that we are going

299
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:28,749
to detect for this reason we have already

300
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,509
started to do some tests

301
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:32,679
using the rep italia that maybe

302
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,089
someone knows ever heard

303
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:38,049
of the udc italia is not just backup  it is

304
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,259
a beautiful circuit that allows you

305
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:46,119
to 4 4 2 inputs two outputs ago but you

306
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:50,109
ca125 and always per second so it

307
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:51,639
allows you to make the outbreak

308
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,159
both already generated by the functions and by

309
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,279
point pid

310
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,670
many other applications that it is a

311
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,199
commercial product to  we were

312
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:05,490
there they arrested it well I ended up even

313
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,180
so

314
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,730
if, however, if you have any questions I am

315
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:19,370
happy to answer you yes yes

316
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,280
no practically what you see is

317
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,310
a non-rome chip practically

318
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,300
transparent which is about 5 x 5 mm large

319
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,080
of the photodiodes you can't see them

320
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,330
actually they are made there are four

321
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,730
so arranged in a window and then two

322
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,970
large ones above and below but they are four

323
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,740
separate photodiodes yes even if not

324
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,580
you see them let's say

325
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,740
how it is

326
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,149
if they are physically arranged like this at 41

327
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,040
24 squares yes and then two

328
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,779
large rectangles that are used for the tracking error

329
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,310
which is the other error that is used to

330
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,140
drive the lens not because the lens at

331
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,029
two to two degrees of  freedom

332
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:12,190
one is inside out let's say to adjust

333
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,170
to adjust the focus error and one is

334
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,390
back and forth to adjust tracking

335
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,060
error i.e. the other difference let's say no

336
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,690
exact it is but yes you can't practically

337
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,149
you can't see with the naked eye and I

338
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:26,540
also tried to

339
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,290
look at them  under the area is very small

340
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,360
gentlemen and sins under a microscope maybe

341
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,040
something can see maybe something

342
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,570
that we must however we do not have

343
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,940
easy access to microscopes a little

344
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,180
bit heavier ones that have a little more good

345
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,360
but yes no then in the pd let's say no  there is

346
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,070
only photodiode but there is also mara

347
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,100
identified buffer buffer riba

348
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,980
that

349
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,690
I took a signal initially so

350
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:00,750
not not institute other questions I did not

351
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,600
bring anything unfortunately because the

352
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,570
second protot  hypo still a little fragile

353
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,800
better not to touch it because they

354
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:16,290
are all unraveled no for now there is

355
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,300
still no fixed interaction

356
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,190
because we want to complete the

357
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,230
second prototype because the first does not

358
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,720
even make sense to sample sides because it

359
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,540
is not not calibrated no second in the  moment in

360
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,820
which even if you calibrate it in the moment in which

361
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,320
the temperature changes for a moment a

362
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,670
moment the humidity the rubber bands do not

363
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,889
respond in the same way

364
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:37,260
so you will basically stay so it's

365
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,050
only for now it's just let's say you can

366
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,279
see here you can see the  waveform

367
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,500
however does not mean anything we say no a

368
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,510
physical meaning

369
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,010
this however is something that we are

370
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,329
trying to rectify with version

371
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:50,339
2 we say with port type 2

372
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,630
we are talking with the ng vin that

373
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,459
the national body of geophysics and

374
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,110
volcanology that have  a research center in

375
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,620
Udine and they said that

376
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,690
if we want they can stay there for a

377
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,850
moment the vibrating table and then

378
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,770
even think of calibrating it and qu  then to

379
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,500
use it then in one we thought of

380
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,850
integrating it into a weather

381
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,980
station that is actually always active which is a

382
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,330
very interesting thing and it is something

383
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,490
that can be replicated now I

384
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,790
can show even then these that

385
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,730
our wiki here we talk about the first

386
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,290
prototype that  there are a minimum of

387
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,530
images as you can see then

388
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,280
we have to write something very little

389
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,890
ok if you go to our vichy that wiki

390
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,230
point to point org with the h at the beginning

391
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,670
you can see among the arbi 21 projects with

392
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,140
lots of images and lots of video and

393
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,370
if you want to conclude with a flourish you

394
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,500
have to give my big big face that I'll

395
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,550
tell you a few things

396
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,969
let's see if

397
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,760
yes this stuff for example shows

398
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,530
here it is this is the optical module

399
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,199
this is the reflective surface and

400
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,419
these are these are

401
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:18,250
our our circuits

402
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,099
signal acquisition nodes this is the part of this

403
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,569
is a part of hard disk and cut and

404
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,459
this is the actuator let's say of the

405
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:30,400
head and then practically this here

406
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,530
what you see here is the circuit that then

407
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,570
drives the head and

408
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,280
actually moves it this instead the rep

409
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:42,039
italia that works as a pid and therefore

410
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,630
in the moment in which it has more a little bit

411
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,490
true immediately but a variation well

412
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,740
I finish 25 seconds before

413
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,400
if you have other questions

414
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,880
yes yes yes I heard about it as

415
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,350
then to trace unfortunately trace

416
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,700
earthquakes

417
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,900
practically a trick that you can do

418
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,390
is to count the difference in the

419
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,710
arrival times of the arrival times of the

420
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,100
pds waves however them precisely to one to a ray

421
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,550
of seeing at least two or three

422
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,320
ideally 33 seismographs to then see

423
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,820
invent the point yes it is possible

424
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,180
but it is much more i.e. in the end it makes much

425
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,190
more sense to rely on a network such as the

426
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,220


427
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,930
Italian amateur seismometer seismometer network that

428
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,440
there is already there and therefore they do

429
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,030
also data acquisition precisely with

430
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,670
serious seismographs let's say those bought

431
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,670
let's say let's also start talking with them

432
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,590
for a possible collaboration and then in the

433
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:53,230
future we will see after the whereabouts  rò maker faire

434
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,400
other questions

435
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,149
well thanks for your attention
