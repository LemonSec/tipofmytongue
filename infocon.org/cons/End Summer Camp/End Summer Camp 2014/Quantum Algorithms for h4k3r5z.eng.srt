1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
first thing try not to start a

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,220
quote

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,870
and the fathers of quantum computers

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,940
designed as quantum to simulate

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,280
a physical reality that with our

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,169
classical computers we can not

7
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:16,340
do efficiently

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,400
so this was all to

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,220
simulate reality then I can say for the

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,810
supply chain  and I put it at the beginning in the

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,640
meantime what is cool and then because it reminds me a

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,739
lot of those stories I

13
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:37,780
read in books where they told me about

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,520
huge mine trains and they were

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,070
only computers with a

16
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,809
lousy processor and with very few ram and

17
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:47,769
this computer

18
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:50,320
ok there is  a bit of a diatribe because

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,089
it is not yet known if it is quantum

20
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:55,300
really a few months ago the polytechnic

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,510
of zurich a paper explaining this here

22
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,940
in our opinion it is not quantum but on

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,410
this thing here we are investing a

24
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,610
lot

25
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,270
google nasa is another company of

26
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,660
military things  I didn't know how to pronounce it thanks

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,810
ok or in any case it interested her to do

28
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,130
machine learning

29
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,229
artificial intelligence on these things  and later

30
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:21,850
we will see from the complexity theory side

31
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,940
this what it means because

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,229
up to this thing here for us at

33
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:31,720
security because we are interested in

34
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,429
the shore factoring algorithm

35
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:36,340
because if we can build a

36
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,869
quantum computer we can

37
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:39,819
catalyze the cryptography that

38
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,170
we can  to destroy the cryptography

39
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,679
that we hope now certainly

40
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:46,360
google wants to make machine the

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,179
results of salt and above all ethical

42
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:52,530
for science per se because

43
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,340
especially in complexity theory

44
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,560
we are discovering new classes of

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,630
complexity therefore a purely

46
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,190
beautiful thing from a theoretical point of view  ok

47
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,770
this has yes instead yes ok then this

48
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,580
is the premise is purely classical it

49
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,610
was discovered in 75 allows us to

50
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,250
reduce the problem of factoring a

51
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,310
number into its factors in the search

52
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,530
for the order of a

53
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,580
random number a on a group  module n what is

54
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,550
the order of a number on a group

55
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,069
let's see you can see

56
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:37,040
then what it is  the theoretical part the

57
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,900
practical example really easy easy

58
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,459
if we take this one we move it

59
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:46,310
to the left this is a remarkable product it

60
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,280
is a binomial we can read it that

61
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,480
product this product is equal to zero it

62
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,790
means that there are some ducks too

63
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,269
we can divide  this year is

64
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,980
the practical example and if we want to

65
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,669
break it down by prime factors 187 we take

66
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:09,470
the number at random by 20 30 22

67
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,910
the module group of 180 78 because 32

68
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:21,360
to the euro to an ok then we make 32

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,270
to the fourth plus l by 32 the fourth minus

70
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,540
equal to zero is fine for us because because

71
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,209
the exponent is even and we can do it

72
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:37,410
this is 68 this 66 and llc of 187

73
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,050
with 68 planes c

74
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,900
the murder of 187 with 66 and 17 and 17 times

75
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,200
11 from 187

76
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,870
so it is easy  this the

77
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,920
funny thing is that there is a certain provoli

78
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,080
pack that the exponent is even

79
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,790
the inscription always depends on the

80
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:09,060
cai number it was ok I started to

81
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,349
see which unit of information

82
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,510
name but of a quantum computer that

83
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,048
like everyone do it is the  kiwi ed  it is

84
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,108
simply a point in the surface

85
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:23,490
of this sphere then usually there is the

86
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,050
comparison with the seat cat which can

87
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,860
be both alive and dead but this comparison is a bit of a

88
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,930
fallacy because

89
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,030
there is another degree of freedom more that

90
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,639
is  the whole equator is so good that

91
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,070
when it detects it, observe the value of the

92
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,860
cube it we will never be able to read the

93
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,169
point on the sphere

94
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:48,289
we will only read the 0 1

95
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:51,750
so when we go to see the gap it is

96
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,030
alive or dead before being alive and

97
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,710
dead in the same  time

98
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,520
ok is what

99
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,900
you have in mind as a model

100
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,060
when you grow up concludes that

101
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,639
funny thing is that this sphere becomes

102
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,210
a lot more however you can

103
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,919
always see it as a composition of

104
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,039
small spheres in the case of dimension 1

105
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:16,169
the qubit and the sphere

106
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:17,699
this is the story of block respond

107
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,430
as representation with more dimensions

108
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,460
and a little more difficult to see the thing

109
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:29,909
ok exact how lean and also in

110
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,379
quantum mechanics we use the

111
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:34,380
rotation brach  and simply these

112
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,930
are vectors we are not interested in seeing

113
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:44,490
much more yes exact there is the other which is

114
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,130
the conjugated transposed one which is that

115
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,319
line these are colonie readers

116
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,360
ok this is the type slide and

117
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,770
technical definition the qubit is a

118
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,870
vector in the  space in two dimensions

119
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,520
suu kyi the important thing to say is that

120
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,710
they must keep this property

121
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:12,779
has given coefficients must be from

122
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,050
a1 for emilian pmi those that

123
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,119
foo the probability

124
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,199
in reality this is not a

125
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,659
very bad sentence it is false but there is in  game

126
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:23,639
of probability on this thing here and

127
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,589
the base of our vector space

128
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:27,599
are these two vectors here that are

129
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,239
orthogonal you know if you make the

130
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:33,269
true product but this is the

131
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:36,349
two-dimensional representation which is a bit ugly but

132
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:40,409
it is also done like this and you see  that here it is zero

133
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:42,809
and more does nothing it says of two this

134
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:44,399
vector buys it I go to lasino it can

135
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,829
be at 50 per cent euro at 50 per

136
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:51,559
cent 0 on topics it would be the equator

137
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,679
then we said  what is the kit

138
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:57,360
was let's talk about how to evolve this

139
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,419
chivu it is true that you are trying to make

140
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,639
an algorithm to elaborate something to

141
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,749
me the computation

142
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,920
we have the paul matrix which

143
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,980
technically are the basis of the space

144
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,150
to the matrices associated with the vector it

145
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,730
simply means that  I thought to do

146
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,550
what the hell we want we can do

147
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,560
the classical computation with this

148
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,500
electrical or we solve the problems

149
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,300
that we are able to solve with

150
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,670
our computers

151
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,960
this thing here we have to live it as

152
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,690
the equivalent of the gate and not me is a

153
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,280
quantum circuit you do so this is

154
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,780
the qubit this would be the passage of

155
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,030
time and this blog with which it has a

156
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,450
particular elevating matrix because

157
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,200
as it is written p1 is where it would come

158
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,700
for others in milan it means that they

159
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,040
are rotations

160
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,990
ok and it can be a rotation because

161
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,370
quantum mechanics must be

162
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,419
reversible  and this modeling

163
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,890
and evolution of state with

164
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,270
rotations allows us to do this

165
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,350
what here

166
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:11,130
ok the factoring problem

167
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,419
classically we know how to do it very

168
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:17,919
well these praises of the

169
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,490
factoring problem is something exponential

170
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,710
so for large numbers such as

171
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,520
those used for ps it is a bit difficult to

172
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,840
do factoring the

173
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,570
quantum algorithm of shock has made shore  in

174
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,429
94 instead or dn to the third therefore

175
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,349
polynomial this design of the type

176
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:43,849
of complexity classes that

177
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:46,670
we have and we suspect that you say

178
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,759
sends you from horror accounts lung to

179
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:52,550
then problems rooming time for the

180
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,410
world championship

181
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,440
at arbitrary precision contained

182
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,639
in the list all the problems that

183
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,170
we already know how to resolve in time then

184
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,940
venial but they also have something more

185
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,949
ok in the drawing that I did

186
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:09,220
in my opinion indeed I was a little better

187
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,079
because you can see that the short ones the most

188
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,420
complete are those that are yes mp that

189
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,199
mpa

190
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:17,120
the plants are those really a

191
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,110
a lot a lot difficult explained just like that it

192
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,030
was bad ok the fact

193
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,520
is now inside btp but why us

194
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,620
commendable example of c  how to do

195
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,100
the shore algorithm in fact we

196
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,010
do not know yet if not stein di pp the

197
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,500
problem is that it is difficult to prove

198
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,680
that something cannot be done and that

199
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,960
the lower complexity limit of a

200
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,120
problem is safe

201
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,480
so it is still an open problem and it is

202
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,880
very  curious

203
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,880
because if it is shown that factoring is

204
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,720
not pp then we have a

205
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,080
problem that is cmp and it is about pil and

206
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,520
therefore we have shown that walking

207
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,920
towards dell p so this thing of

208
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,530
quantum computers can also be seen

209
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,540
as Sardinia attack this

210
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,060
problem  fi versus np ok the

211
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,400
technical slide but it means this is very

212
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,280
bad but do not pay attention to what is

213
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:40,420
written here this is a circuit for two

214
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,260
close it takes the walk to hurt

215
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,810
that it is that really powerful instrument

216
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,810
of quantum vegetation

217
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,580
and it is a  po what allows us to

218
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,440
do factoring and to read the

219
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,390
result but Monday is

220
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,910
in the phase

221
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:06,070
for example we want to write

222
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,660
the number 300 as phase each in binary this

223
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,399
nu  mero is nailed in the river

224
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,269
lockheed hit as in the first qubit 0 and a

225
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:20,740
lumino and in the second it is only 0 40 the

226
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,339
x1 x2 fair only 0 of blake it is

227
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,140
therefore this circuit

228
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,540
that with this gate lager the classic

229
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,750
to the decimal digit voilà 7 album

230
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,020
this is  the rotation but it

231
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,660
practically subtracts or on the other chivu then

232
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,040
the country of xda and loeb and y so

233
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,600
we have something that allows us to

234
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,800
take our reader

235
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,950
as a phase of our kybits going from

236
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,149
the other side of these circuits

237
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:59,250
at least in the phase these  things ok

238
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,390
maybe this spare weber washed ask me questions

239
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,810
in stand 2

240
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,750
but lady of everything and weed

241
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,350
this writing here this is called

242
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,370
periodic state it is true we have an

243
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,930
assignee income is worth zero

244
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:26,540
now he lives it seems ppr is the group

245
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,850
the order of the group what they are

246
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,880
trying and realizing that by a

247
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,500
miracle and if she and things like that

248
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,740
made us think about our qst

249
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,240
quantum file transform

250
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,770
we somehow manage to  la gerrard

251
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:47,120
and that's what I was looking for her and

252
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,040
this is the circuit that does what they

253
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,680
are looking for right to live that

254
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,600
talk about the gates of the ghetto lacquer now

255
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,310
paolo particular thing now

256
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,910
also takes us the judgment neither 0 and 0 and I think

257
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,170
for position a  50 and 50 in saying that

258
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,430
we end up and let's go to read

259
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,600
we have fifty percent

260
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,199
and percent to read the variety companies

261
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:19,560
if we then I llc companies and he liked to

262
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,120
think for this we ask the

263
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,980
possible we do not make

264
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,670
these foods

265
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,610
a man that weighs  very well so

266
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,490
average the n because the first plus 30 euro

267
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,860
the second can be true when I

268
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,610
have to read we can read 00

269
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:46,120
all of them and 10 taken and ata careful

270
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,920
so this serves as a sort of

271
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,720
input for this second part when

272
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,339
this second part  here simply

273
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:58,519
good evening turn too well known everything

274
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,700
better

275
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,410
ok we can do it

276
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,690
that second gate yen this one

277
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,220
brings us the states of this kind

278
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
so we have in the first the first part

279
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,170
of the  director all possible to start

280
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,320
at n yes second record this

281
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,540
was here the value of our

282
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,880
function is that you

283
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,540
always give us raised to k

284
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,200
so it would be

285
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,510
because the name is calculated in parallel

286
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:46,020
for all but the 10 mln could not be

287
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,710
read

288
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,340
we see what  there would be numbers that

289
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,410
repeat

290
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,930
I will call you supreme and register 32 sin

291
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,760
second say yes if on the first second and

292
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,130
we see that after the pain dr the values

293
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,980
of yes that the director can because there is

294
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,830
a new 32 only 89 that corresponds to the

295
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,570
bio and  as I discovered he chose us he

296
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,810
spent this summer inside the church

297
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,180
we somehow

298
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,449


299
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,980
manage no and manage to maintain once we give

300
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,990
r apply what we have seen

301
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,060
we break down the aims the

302
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:40,920
factors this ok

303
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:50,940
I would say the streets one thing now we

304
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:57,449
talked about  condition there is also a

305
00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:59,300
part of quantum information

306
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:05,699
for example rite to develop algorithms

307
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,440
and resistant to

308
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,450
how many there are all fairy tales are

309
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,630
doing mental door

310
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,550
quantum information and

311
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,780
look at it went into crisis from one part

312
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,620
of the world to the other in time

313
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,600
then sorry because you are thinking about

314
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,370
what I have to explain with this

315
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:36,640
then it is bob alice to these

316
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:46,199
chemists that we can exploit at 0

317
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,810
alice bobby cole

318
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,689
is intact and  bund that now your father

319
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,080
simply those two you throw away and have

320
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,750
already been close to each other

321
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,280
like Pirelli in itself and the other group b

322
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,839
by passing through these two behind the

323
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,380
foods that the 2 cs of the code and making the

324
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,869
measurement according to a sensational trafficking

325
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,000
anyone

326
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,250
for 600 thousand 00 all

327
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,590
four combinations we see that in whoever

328
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,810
calls him b arrives the value that goes to

329
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,570
win of the gdp and you tell us

330
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,110
and this speed is the advertising

331
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,180
right here to the whole seriously undermine the

332
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,330
results of the misia bob

333
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,840
but the beautiful thing that it says  that they

334
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,180
can give us what I want because the

335
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,990
judgment is Sicily yes I would say complex

336
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,270
so doing it for yuki of a very

337
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,300
long Greek head exceeds the

338
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,730
value of divin  a comedy in there

339
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,830
however by sending only two I send a

340
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,940
beautiful thing to eboli

341
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,860
then oh well you can read an event because in

342
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,290
the evening if the tsarina has it but

343
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:23,810
there was ect to do the calculations it would be said

344
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,940
that a bobo arrives at the other gall bladder

345
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:40,400
what it foresees there is the theme is

346
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,090
[ __ ] but it is only the uses of

347
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,800
quantum mechanical tools

348
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,100
to do it agricultural it succeeds or I

349
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,290
took them final

350
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,370
and the militias

351
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,010
come back to me there if I

352
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,299
wanted to prove that it did

353
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:01,730
as a theme

354
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,409
if you want to see it after mine  our village

355
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,130


356
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,960
there is the pgt site it would point everything but it

357
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,179
has to be done and it is free in

358
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:13,640
software that against the policy

359
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,250
inside your wife and children emails arrive

360
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,600
no cipher that sends in reply

361
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,440
then in misery encrypted mail

362
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:38,630
enough this is only good question

363
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,300
for  secure asymmetric cryptography things

364
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,500
for the crimes that rsa

365
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,050
tip the prelate of the discrete rhythm with

366
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:51,800
kuchar and their quietly for

367
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,910
the pd typography in calais simm  ethical n

368
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,530
I know but I think we

369
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,580
are beyond the devils some grip that

370
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,130
allows you to put a sort of root

371
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,770
to the complexity of the more complete problems m

372
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,030
those that grow

373
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,860
exponentially puts us to the expedient

374
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,870
one fact two basically that it is already

375
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:24,150
something very useful I don't know  if he lives

376
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,790
immersed I know that they have managed to

377
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:30,740
factor the number of grandeur to 148

378
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,890
the soul that the short nor to 512gb but the

379
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,440
problem is that they cannot do

380
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,780
it efficiently if the mind works to

381
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,950
optimize something they do

382
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:58,400
not know what it is  one thing enough they keep

383
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:24,769
well without magnetic and silwan test tube and

384
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:27,859
lots of people private to happy stable

385
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:31,779
but what he wrote there venia

386
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:34,479
english about this thing said that

387
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,589
when you are tried so many people

388
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:38,029
fail tt different way

389
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:40,459
the level is 700 the most stable

390
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:55,639
through  exact a certain but exact

391
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:58,369
exact but that be useful for the

392
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:09,769
computation no but then it's me then the

393
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:16,269
problem south enters the law that

394
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:57,860
uses what is the electrical field  romagnetic and you

395
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,260
modify the electromagnetic field with

396
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:14,840
zero remains physical and for this you need

397
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,010
all the very low temperature

398
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,220
is always saved to enter it perhaps also the

399
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:35,010
photo somewhere this the photo

400
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,830
that is this is the arm of a man who

401
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,490
is so behind it

402
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,370
can be

403
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,270
ok

404
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,820
yes  yes then

405
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:34,880
well we are first in my opinion it was that

406
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,770
lie

407
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,680
well

408
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,730
in my book elisa the explanation is

409
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,850
correct explain to you the one that hung

410
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,980
from the definition trust countries the language

411
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,770
of goethe to whom we will give it

412
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,890
but what really intuitive

413
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,430
seeing the rotations of the subtractions

414
00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:00,060
because on the side of the xv  which was the kim

415
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,410
value of the cd because it was something that

416
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,790
was not there pious one prefers in one's

417
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:09,120
own 0 1 on the other side p wrote

418
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,650
that value of that combination of

419
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,230
judgments term 00 for he wrote it in

420
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,480
phase that vanelli writes it for fouls of

421
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,700
the hyper one hopes gigantic with the

422
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,580
combination of several phases of the

423
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,800
small kybit so it is urgent melilli for

424
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,750
substantially giant equator
