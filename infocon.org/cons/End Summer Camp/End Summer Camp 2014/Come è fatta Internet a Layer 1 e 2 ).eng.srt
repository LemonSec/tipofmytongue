1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
let's start with a small

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,109
slide introduction for this talk that I had to

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,240
prepare the afternoon but for me

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,330
its just to download a little guilty

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,040
we have been busy preparing the

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,320
talk tomorrow night which is definitely more

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,330
interesting than this some of

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,070
you have already seen  out while

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,170
I was setting up I would say that the premises are

10
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,460
correct so I would say that this talk

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,840
and we make it become a real talk

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,579
maybe we put on a bit

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,160
of discussion even starting from

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,469
what to be but see what

15
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,100
we talk about it

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,170
that comes from a  very rich in

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,960
numbers rookie national mailing lists

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,670
asked how icaro who mailing list of

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,219
how internet is made and level one at

20
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,730
level 2 its I try to say something

21
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,890
so if a little introduction about this

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,399
who I am

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,300
is fine who are many they only remind me

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,800
for the country  the o in any case for

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,239
the grills anyway the

26
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,069
high voltage experiments for us I do not only do

27
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:05,659
what

28
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:09,720
michele nick of hcv I deal with a  a

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,600
lot of years of telecommunications so

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,790
the spaces for everything behind it

31
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,360


32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,500
and then let's say that level 1 level 2

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,409
of the internet are however all in all

34
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,100
quite known let's see for a moment

35
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,150
the real cases we usually turn

36
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,549
on the giant computer we have an ip if  the

37
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,420
ex ip of archi works and we go on the

38
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,509
internet well if them ms of arca and it

39
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,500
works what is in between tello on pc and

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,689
the machine we want to reach

41
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,360
there is a lot of stuff surely

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,950
we are not going to talk about routing because

43
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,960
why c  'it's a talk tomorrow if I

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,899
remember correctly that it deals with

45
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:57,329
peeling in Italy so all the

46
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,810
part behind the

47
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,630
for three let's see for a moment level

48
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,710
1 level 2

49
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,350
let's take the case of the esc here because

50
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,930
because there is some  many cases ten years ago

51
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,910
polimenti the physical means that were going to be

52
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:15,670
used were two radios sorry copper

53
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,550
some fiber scattered here now

54
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,519
surely the last few years there is also the

55
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,500
radio world starting here from the former that

56
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,930
sure  mind and we have a radio release

57
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,080
what does this mean it means that

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,299
level 1 just basic level there is

59
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:34,510
no physical medium so a cable or a

60
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,480
fiber that interconnects us between our

61
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,690
first router which in this case is here

62
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,370
in the house and the  rest of the

63
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,170
internet

64
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,730
the time you send to see many things

65
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,849
of the clarification our computer

66
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:50,080
interconnects via radio to the first access

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,910
point sport connects via cable to

68
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,920
router and so on but let's

69
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,769
focus for a moment on what

70
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:58,030
concerns the internet part is true  and

71
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,060
its substance the current day what is it

72
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,880
that we have of possible means of

73
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,530
transmission copper fiber radio

74
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,609
indicatively as maximum maximum

75
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,519
technologies present copper we all know it

76
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,640
is the classic telecom twisted pair of

77
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,890
60 years ago it is probably always the one

78
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,420
that has never been changed that reaches us up

79
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,750
to  inside the house and that arrives

80
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,639
directly or indirectly in the

81
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,829
telecom center after we also see

82
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:32,470
these details free optical which is not that

83
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,359
lla that usually sees you

84
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:37,090
the operator who limits the price tag to 20

85
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,549
euros per month fibrotic home that in any case

86
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,069
a transmission medium and no longer based on

87
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:44,560
a transmission of current those

88
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,359
electrical signals bis the optical signals

89
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:50,560
the third means that you go to see is the

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,650
radio therefore

91
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,660
electrical signal transmission systems, however, always a

92
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,030
physical medium but using letters as

93
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,540
a transmission medium, copper is certainly a

94
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,489
system that has been used since the

95
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:05,830
beginning because for good or bad a

96
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,569
twisted pair at the time all if we had them at

97
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:10,569
home on a good or bad twisted pair  but even

98
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,280
with the technologies of the time an

99
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,470
analog modem ran more or less

100
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,380
quietly and therefore of a thousand and 200

101
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,440
bps upwards, then with the various violations,

102
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,940
however, it was possible to pass in

103
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,729
analogue all in all a considerable amount

104
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,840
of  information and

105
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,430
therefore

106
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,650
the first to be used is certainly the

107
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,680
one most in use because it is used because it is

108
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,200
a physical medium and copper.  ommato is

109
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,169
wanted if we went from twenty years ago

110
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:43,600
to say an order of magnitude where on

111
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
a twisted pair it was possible to do one thousand and

112
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,720
200 bps 14 4 28 and 8 up to the

113
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,200
present day in which all in all first with

114
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,110
the hdsl then with the  adsl

115
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,020
then now with levi dsl it is possible to

116
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,390
pass all in all even over

117
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,640
clearly limited distances in 100

118
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,940
mega not full duplex a 120 medica

119
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,940
is there without problems so the copper

120
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,180
currently certainly one of the most

121
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,880
to give me back to give it back then remember

122
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,480
a little more  more a little more it

123
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,730
remembers rai1 of definitely

124
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,020
transmissive means all the most

125
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,680
popular

126
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,240
states what we can

127
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,950
usually pass on copper and where it begins and

128
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,780
where it ends our branches that we have

129
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,020
at home until months ago because we are

130
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,240
blocking the months years for a year  maximum

131
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,160
two for the lucky ones,

132
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,560
the copper started from our home socket and

133
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,230
reached an exchange

134
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,080
usually located under the house on the

135
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,550
road to the cellar on the

136
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,830
main street venia for n  once the twisted pair

137
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,290
on multi-copy multi-copy arrived at the

138
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,010
telecom exchange and there was

139
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,610
the slam on the stairs usually dsl seems in

140
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,320
analogue clearly the various

141
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,750
perimeters in the case but now what has

142
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,120
changed has changed that now in the

143
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,220
last few months we see that they are opening

144
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,990
the  city of half Italy for

145
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,080
this reason they are moving the slam

146
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,450
or our twisted pair that previously

147
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,430
started from the casino

148
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,220
serafini centrale telecom without any

149
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:25,790
further inter modulation now

150
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,890
the central no longer ends because if you see

151
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,320
reality veil why under the only one

152
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,820
bring one here too though  I did not have time to

153
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,960
go and retrieve it

154
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,890
if you see now of the telecom columns

155
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,170
the street ones of the patch weapon

156
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,340
have been modified

157
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,650
because before it is the classic

158
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,730
warm gray cabinet so all couples

159
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,640
oxidized quarrels who looks at them there it was like

160
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,240
crying

161
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,580
what did the  cute

162
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,270
telecom men first as foreplay and

163
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,130
metal clad thing put him  in a beautiful

164
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,840
metal locker with the key it is a

165
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,830
little safer not much seemed to have

166
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,460
ended there

167
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,800
then after a few weeks I changed the

168
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,170
cabinet back to another mini telecom I know

169
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,570
if you have ever followed the work and

170
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,350
did it removed the lid

171
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,650
in the photo above red with what

172
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,870
inside there is simply an

173
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,240
ADSL2 slam because because the

174
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,520
fundamental problem of our ADSL lines

175
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,100
is the distance the degradation of the

176
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,410
copper cable what does it mean it means that if we

177
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,390
have our five kilometers, we

178
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,050
double the central  adsl dsl

179
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,120
two what we want we forget that to

180
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,330
make it work with fair values

181
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,740


182
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,890
therefore dsl vdsl2 has been introduced

183
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,950
what does it mean why I have to take 5 km

184
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,290
of cable from home to Islam put a

185
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,420
single control unit terminate all lines

186
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,920
quite clearly  counterproductive

187
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,610
then let's

188
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,200
say this cap over the

189
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,440
wardrobes let's go put islam

190
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,960
usually vdsl vdsl2 adsl2 those are

191
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,570
putting you down  lecom in Italy I think

192
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,430
it means that the five

193
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,800
kilometers of cable that we had before between

194
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,410
our house and the plant have become

195
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,150
in the best cases a few hundred

196
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,680
meters in the worst cases under 1 km

197
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,150
therefore the termination collection point

198
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,390
at level two

199
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,810
substantially of the  our adsl the cases

200
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,720
more become to the

201
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,099
operator's telecom center with islam here we are

202
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,110
connected but it has become the hero

203
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,719
May in the street where the

204
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,960
copper flow is collected is converted

205
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,719
through Islam into fiber and from that part

206
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,550
to level 3 and  so we no

207
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,580
longer care about our purpose

208
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,000
this the case in itself this is

209
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,160
what usually comes to you as optical fiber

210
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,110
type fiber arrived and fastweb

211
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,910
telecom fiber arrived those in

212
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,160
vogue perhaps signs and for all it is

213
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,040
fiber us stanley lady dance

214
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,780
they tell you a bit of partial truth

215
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,190
clearly because the fiber doesn't even

216
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,160
bring it into the house the fiber on the

217
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,030
patch cabinet and the speeds that

218
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,500
you still have.  I can ensure they are however

219
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,510
comparable to those of fiber because

220
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,160
because they start earlier

221
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,780
we have more determination in the

222
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,180
central well it is limited to the

223
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,340
first patch cabinet under the house

224
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,200
this is the first physical medium so

225
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,710
copper that we have

226
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,510
further means available that we are talking about

227
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,180
what they are  not free optic fiber optic

228
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,810
even here we can have thousands of tp

229
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,160
because all in broadly the three

230
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,380
main types of optic fibers

231
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,020
we can use for our

232
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,020
domestic release however corporate

233
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,740
which are on the ftth fiber then fiber

234
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,740
to the home then the classic

235
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,440
ethernet fiber  that ethernet is brought

236
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,570
clearly means that there is a protocol it is

237
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,850
certainly better in the media converter

238
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,950
that is brought from home to their

239
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,160
patch cabinet it can be the

240
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,710
sdh fiber therefore clearly

241
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,050
part of an ldh therefore also been on

242
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:23,430
a cdm and third type that  is

243
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,430
developing in the latter period is the

244
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,510
cos  iddetta passive optical shores

245
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,060
what is seen what changes for two

246
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:39,300
technologies sdh ftt home and passive sdh

247
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,560
certainly is a ring

248
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,170
this to say in a short time and with the

249
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,600
bari formations a shared ring

250
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,570
compute entes where through a dm

251
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,730
therefore to too much multiplexer I am going to

252
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,710
add  or subtract then pull me

253
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,930
out insert my stream on

254
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:00,090
the entire stream sdh ftth instead fiber to

255
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,090
the home is a fiber point point then

256
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,250
part of my media converter comes

257
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,470
another media converter an optical router

258
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,070
located in central and the password

259
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,680
they are starting  even those is going

260
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,780
to put it down to ice lately some

261
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,410
areas is a na'vi and a half because it is not a

262
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,230
sbh ring it is a multipoint fiber

263
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,720
because because it usually starts at a

264
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,180
central apparatus it arrives at an

265
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,120
optical divider so clearly

266
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,310
nothing active just at  passive level

267
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,310
my fiber which divided into 8 16 24 fibers

268
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,300
that go there in the various apartments

269
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,000
, perfectly optical analog type  so

270
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,060
nothing active and what does this mean

271
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:53,260
what does it mean exact very good what

272
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,640
does this mean this means yes

273
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,290
I can do things also nice because

274
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,089
clearly what comes to me

275
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:00,010
also reaches all the others and

276
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,160
vice versa

277
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,459
exact

278
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:08,890
see good good at all  points of

279
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,220
view therefore clearly clearly in

280
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,810
your condominium and then go and see

281
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,820
everything that the others do

282
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,040
clearly after the apparatus you have the

283
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,600
two maybe makes you pass only yours but

284
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,130
as good as the paper rapper cards

285
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,140
so that is not the

286
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,029
problem in the least  then they will see we have seen

287
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:32,100
fiber optic

288
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,500
the last means of transmission

289
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,940
we are going to talk about now very

290
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,220
quickly and what is

291
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,180


292
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,360
radio typology here as well as for radio as for

293
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,470
copper as for fiber also in radio to

294
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,050
a whole series  of sub categories into

295
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,660
which it can be divided because because you have

296
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,730
radio transmissions it means everything means

297
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,330
nothing radio protocols that exist

298
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,790
there are but do not end

299
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,480
surely the internet releases via radio

300
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,760
that we can only have with two

301
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,080
main characteristics

302
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,779
to begin with invades

303
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:12,459
a shared free bandwidth

304
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,079
this is a big discriminant of the

305
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,450
connections that can take us

306
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,610
home via radio what does it mean

307
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,529
free band van der core free band and

308
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:23,140
therefore shared  wanda fired

309
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,450
but in the centered means that I am going to

310
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,250
buy from the purchase of the

311
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,290
advisors I terminate

312
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,339


313
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:32,470
the use of a certain frequency

314
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,320
assigned exclusively to me by the ministry of communications what

315
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,520
does that band mean and if the

316
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,680
milan interferences have disturbances and

317
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,550
I can only communicate

318
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,959
with my repeaters without

319
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,120
interference from other operators

320
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,550
shared band or therefore free band

321
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,220
means like the classic hiperlan that is

322
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,430
used means that the

323
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,649
frequency band can be used without a

324
00:13:57,649 --> 00:13:59,240
dedicated license

325
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,279
you pay a small concession and

326
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,140
that that bank is therefore not subject

327
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,540
protection against disturbances is not subject to

328
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,490
a requirement the possibility of issuing

329
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,829
links and guarantees and it is clearly I

330
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:16,160
cannot guarantee something that I can

331
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,660
not even get so

332
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,910
permanently bands fired for

333
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,390
example then max and famous wavemax

334
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,829
workers garko and a half must be

335
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:26,630
fired so I  that I do not have the

336
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,339
wimax license I put an antenna on

337
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:31,040
the irregular wimax band holders that

338
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,769
license can call the purpose if I do not know

339
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:36,320
if it is still called that and make me

340
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,140
clearly switch off of surbo

341
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,370
shared band hiperlan 5 giga hertz or various

342
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:47,300
here 5 17 24 giger has no potential

343
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,089
disturbances and therefore in the face of a course it is

344
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,209
certainly minor also offers

345
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:57,020
minor guarantees sorry so these two

346
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,420
main types of lilacs that you rai and

347
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,910
we can have what is underneath us

348
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,680
after we can talk about it for hours

349
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,899
let's say that underneath it is

350
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:08,860
difficult to condense everything however

351
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,860
tell me

352
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,810
mainly  from the part of transport

353
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,220
from

354
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,399
the user to the telephone operator

355
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,050
such as of  these technologies because in

356
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,880
fact many are the same technologies

357
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,279
then they are actually used even they are

358
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,420
also used by the telephone operator

359
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,019
to make the transport to the backbone

360
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,120
or in any case to the internet exchange of other

361
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,070
telephone operators so to go

362
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,720
just to understand the internet in itself not

363
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,100
only what is offered to the operator

364
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:44,430
as the technology used is good or bad

365
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,010
technologies that we can

366
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:50,160
use are roughly those twenty

367
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,079
years ago when we were talking about the way to give

368
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,540
the odyssey dbs there is the classic

369
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,519
supine way the branches for calling it and

370
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,170
exchanging it  that to do was tied up

371
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,970
put down

372
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,070
nothing more now clearly things

373
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,970
are a bit evolved main bacon

374
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,680
inevitably seen also the growing

375
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,680
amount of data there is no escaping only

376
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,470
optical fiber optical fiber that can also be

377
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,380
there of any type ftth  usually the

378
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,810
maximums are not used rightly the

379
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,760
main types are what are the

380
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,000
sdh so on a ring or if I have a

381
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,950
fiber  mine dedicated to that point I can

382
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,910
do with it what I want

383
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,890
now we are also moving on the

384
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,170
roofs understand long distance and allows

385
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,410
on fiber with all the economic pros and cons

386
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,910
reliability etc. but

387
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,370
always direction more ethernet on

388
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,980
fiber maybe in dvd then me with more

389
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,899
long fedun the mall and optimizing the

390
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,610
length of the use of fiber and

391
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,980
among the operators in any case certainly

392
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,350
the most used means of optical fiber

393
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,440
where the possibility of having

394
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,800
optical fiber because Italy unfortunately which

395
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,750
unfortunately fortunately depends on

396
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,670
the optical fiber point of view

397
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,230
yes, however, there is not so much where it is that it

398
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,599
depends on the operators right for

399
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,459
some infracom names you know where

400
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:09,780
the motorway is so if you have a

401
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,640
motorway with a toll booth you know if

402
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,250
infracom optical fiber but there is a road

403
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,640
main state road we know in retelit

404
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,230
if it is a

405
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,900
provincial and state road after all if

406
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,189
you will be there that allows there is also

407
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:27,119
interoute well there but optical because

408
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,270
maybe they are abroad where in reality

409
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,340
there is the fiber here on the Trieste but

410
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,890
clearly at a distance for optics it

411
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,200
cannot be used so even there you come

412
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,840
back to things on radio links

413
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,760
radio links clearly of various types

414
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,070
what it means various types

415
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,720
certainly not  goes to use a

416
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,600
free bandwidth if I have to make a backbone transport link

417
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,700
between operators those

418
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,140
usually do the bridge in

419
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,620
licensed band and allows you to export the 500

420
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,480
mega in gb 2 gb that devices I put up

421
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,429
to where up to usually a

422
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:04,500
fiber collection point  because it goes round and round

423
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,160
there you get there transport in three

424
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,890
operators unless it is in quarries of

425
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,809
a remote place like fiber optics

426
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:16,770
there are no big things if you have

427
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,299
any questions about this production

428
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,610
maybe just to comment a little

429
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,290
willingly otherwise  we are almost at the

430
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,700
end of the time

431
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:41,570
yes instead then it works way yes flat

432
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,539
fiber depends by now we get far beyond

433
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,760
that is the basic singlemode fiber without

434
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,019
large that is  the one we have to

435
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:50,240
buy also shop just for

436
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,330
absurdity with the sfp to acts of longer

437
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,429
distance in cisco from 500 euros we are

438
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:58,760
talking about absurd figures at 70 km 90

439
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,889
km without particular problems

440
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,649
gigabit or that you can clearly see

441
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:05,870
other countries equipment your question is  how

442
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,610
does those oceanic fibers work that of

443
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,669
kilometers on a pc and so many hundred there are

444
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:13,100
now not even the laptop connected

445
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,279
however we go to see those fibers

446
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,200
in section we see that every tot kg but

447
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,059
that there are protuberances inserted

448
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,130
in the fiber what are those just for

449
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,059
even they are  of repeaters of repeaters

450
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:27,919
that is the optical signal arrives is

451
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,779
regenerated and the

452
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:31,880
excessive repeater is highlighted as they are

453
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,889
powered and funny if you want to

454
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:35,600
get lost you deserve to see really

455
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,690
funny because I am fed one

456
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,669
on one side the hogwash

457
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:42,710
the continuous current power supply is supplied one on

458
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,169
one side and the  on the other hand, therefore

459
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:46,760
positive on one side of the fiber and

460
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,980
negative on the other  tro side of the fiber with

461
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,990
tensions now I do not remember anyway

462
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,510
in the order of kilovolts because

463
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,690
clearly in order to be able to make me

464
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,860
thousands and thousands of kilometers

465
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,690
of fission we are still very

466
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,340
interesting because we were born to see it and there is

467
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,740
a generator connected in the part with

468
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,690
negative masses  of the high that positive to

469
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,789
mass on the other side of the planet and uses

470
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,519
the fiber to feed the motorcycles

471
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,899
so it is fun to go and see no

472
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:17,179
if they will obviously be federal if

473
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:18,320
some xvi read even the under

474
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,600
have fun there is someone who has done the

475
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,700
power over  ethernet not having optical fiber

476
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,210


477
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,789
here on the one hand they are rack cabinets with

478
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:28,820
optical transmitters of a type between

479
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,190
kilowatts and 4 kilowatts another part

480
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,970
together series of photo photodiodes that

481
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,010
therefore receive input or between

482
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,380
kilowatts and output today

483
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,260
weighs 6 watts just to optimize

484
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:46,150
efficiency here too 9 there

485
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,430
are also usually coaxial cables that

486
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:55,030
power veils of the genre I don't know

487
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,830
if you think it is a  optical level at the level

488
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,590
of sipi let's say I think it is only at an

489
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,750
optical level but you know I don't think they go to make

490
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:09,000
any is yes I think so

491
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,890
do the lieutenant also because with a hundred

492
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,700
of those in the middle

493
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:21,610
yes

494
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,010
to 36 animals

495
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,550
yes

496
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,420
all

497
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:38,740
therefore more beautiful yes exact let's say

498
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,310
who looks at his differences says that

499
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,880
we are a little over time also and

500
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,080
let's say that copper has a big

501
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,110
problem branches out a

502
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,140
disgusting passband very low

503
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,830
optical fiber

504
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,530
a much higher passband what

505
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,720
does his fibrotic mean me in dvd m

506
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,730
so with various wavelengths I

507
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,680
can pass up to depends at the end it

508
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,000
also seems 16 total flows of 10

509
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,270
giga it seems to me therefore if not 16 however

510
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,910
there was not

511
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:25,750
exact however we tell you that the

512
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,520
fiber being an optical thing  very

513
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,700
company opacification clearly therefore

514
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,830
the fiber that I extend now is not lite

515
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,540
in 50 years has the same

516
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,160
optical international level that now

517
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,650
surely now I do not remember it

518
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,320
seems to me c  i is an

519
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,540
average stupid variable attenuation of 3 db x km for ten

520
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,660
years which are not few 3d

521
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,300
it means that after ten years a

522
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,050
half mi fiber will halve

523
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,890
its transmission capacity is fine but

524
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,620
if so we are  well beyond the exact time
