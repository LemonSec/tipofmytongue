1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,179
good morning to my grandmother and fabio the

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:06,569
radio mater evo acronym after three locations z because he

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,630
did not know for these two techniques the

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,920
next 3 talks are he wants to fouls

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,310
I will do them all so I had to calm three

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,779
times in a row

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,490
if not to have the person but the

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,460
block will come  do it here the person himself

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,970
is a friend of mine who served there they arrive

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,469
block I make him do everything

11
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,020
we will see today about the brothers who are the

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,989
first the program we see here that is

13
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,719
quere test those heads a program that is

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,469
used exclusively to keep the logo

15
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,090
during  the competitions

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,590
I don't know for those who know how

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,859
the competitions between doma torio work but in essence

18
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:57,120
you have to make as many connections as possible

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,199
and depending on the rules there are

20
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,949
multipliers in some cases for example in

21
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:06,600
some contexts there is a multiplier

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,790
for each country made so if  I

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,070
connect Italy then that I read a

24
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,590
Swiss are two connections 2

25
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,580
multipliers 2 by 244 points and it goes

26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,930
on so it seemed simple thing in

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,909
reality to for  manage a contest and you

28
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,159
get to quite high levels

29
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,200
I give an example there can be six

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,899
stations at the same time where there are one

31
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:32,159
can go on transmission at a given

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,470
moment then there must be a system

33
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,390
that blocks the transmission of the other

34
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,310
devices while another is transmitting

35
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,190
and things of this type can, however,

36
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,630
link that one has already done on one

37
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,979
station cannot be done by

38
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,840
another on another station it is

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,350
a whole series of problems because the

40
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,020
database is unique in reality we have

41
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,729
applied on each machine then

42
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,110
system  able to replicate the

43
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,299
database are in the machine and is able

44
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,969
to manage the booking on the database

45
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,429
so in case there are two occupants which is

46
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,690
impossible from a technical point of view

47
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,979
but even if there were two connections

48
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,770
on the same

49
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,010
system it succeeds only before it is marked

50
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,410
not  the second

51
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,290
the software is the fact that an Italian who

52
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,810
also lives in Mestre for which he is

53
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,650
one hundred percent Italian the

54
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,570
first thing he asks is  the name of the

55
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:37,080
contest that we can put it then there is

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,170
obligatorily the name we put

57
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,570
mine is the name of the contest and we

58
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,300
take one at random in each competition there

59
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,460
are the various categories we do not choose the

60
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,350
single operator category it

61
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,960
means that only one person operates  on

62
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,630
that radu and safe for the earth

63
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,100
assisted by saying that it is a single

64
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,990
operator but assisted by the cluster the

65
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,750
clusters a system whereby each person

66
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,340
can indicate the connection that they have

67
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,720
done this ends up on an

68
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,430
internet server of which

69
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,900
everyone is shot  the others who are

70
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,580
listening

71
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,870
everyone sees the connection that another made

72
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,950


73
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,880
in that case

74
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,860
is assisted because I can see the

75
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,150
connection that another made

76
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,940


77
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,920


78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,230
advantage

79
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,540
now a separate category many

80
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,910
single operators have denied them I would say

81
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,380
that there is a single broadcast but there

82
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,190
are more people

83
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,140
keep in mind that most  and the

84
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,360
tasks range from 24 to 48

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,320
consecutive hours for which 48 hours a single

86
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,040
person usually I have arrived 32

87
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,900
naturally reconcile with the spaces

88
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,410
to rest on the 48 one usually

89
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,710
bern be more one person if

90
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,750
there is multi operator single simulate

91
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,850
transmitter  two transmitters one

92
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,100
last the ultimative team say that it can

93
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,359
have how many transmitters all

94
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,390
are the calls 7 are six technically

95
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:23,479
from 3 to 6 maximum I am alone

96
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:36,599
then the band we do all the

97
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:39,629
power I am of course depending

98
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:50,339
on the power of the apparatus this

99
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:53,249
second  screen can select

100
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:55,499
with basic things the first is the radio

101
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:58,559
if I connect the radio via serial I

102
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:00,989
am able to automatically

103
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:02,519
control anger what happens if I

104
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,439
have a band passed from the frequency

105
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,539
mantra automatically the ocse as one

106
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,729
of the functions assign the frequency

107
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,889
some factors links it

108
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,019
automatically takes the frequency in two to

109
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:14,729
follow manually each time an  give

110
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,819
the network to make the change and as I said

111
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:22,169
before if there are more log machines it is

112
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:24,059
possible to that galli network for which the

113
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:25,829
database and you have a duplicate between the

114
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:28,559
machines double food for those who do not

115
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:31,169
know the bite

116
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:33,089
would seem a protocol is a

117
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:34,729
transmission system no longer used instead

118
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,559
very used for transmissions also

119
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:41,099
because it is the first digital system that

120
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:43,079
was used ever there is the first

121
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,550
transmission ever it was

122
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,069
digital because the mors is digital in

123
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:48,989
every sense and is the only one

124
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:52,379
digital system that is received and coded

125
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:57,360
by the brain and not by systems this

126
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,329
instead is for the bk a system to

127
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:03,839
transmit the call without using the

128
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,699
voice yes how you have to call to

129
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,529
say for someone to answer it

130
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,169
could be a pain in the ass to

131
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,539
call for 48  hours

132
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,829
this allows you to save your

133
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:15,599
call on the sound card of the

134
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:17,610
hard disk is a europe that having

135
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,589
lost 1 jul automatically makes the

136
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:21,509
call but ten transmission  and calls

137
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:24,419
when someone picks you up when someone

138
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,519
answers you automatically

139
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,159
you answer then a relaxing pole from this

140
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:32,869
point for those who make an extinction account

141
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,860
this link below allows you to

142
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,300
change the filters of the

143
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,890
transmission note for these you switch from one

144
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,930
bank to another goes  to insert or

145
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,360
deactivate filters to

146
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,930
modify others this is useful for the multi

147
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,080
multi but because if the 7 transmitters and

148
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,970
transmit on each trivial you can

149
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,830
have disturbances 1 that other then

150
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,510
automatically this goes to insert

151
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,630
filters to reduce greatly attenuate

152
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,180
the disturbances  that there can be done

153
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,660
this part the flywheel the program

154
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,450
essentially consists of a screen where

155
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,140
the man is able to call himself from two

156
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:27,430
screens which in essence are the

157
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,450
control of not even TV on air that

158
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,860
made me a context is generated in

159
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,720
log files  these guys all together

160
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,640
and already a number of names that

161
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,710
are all put on a database for

162
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,479
which they are ascribed  or my active I am

163
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,630
sorry I have chosen as the same

164
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:02,330
the American at the santos with against this

165
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,470
contest

166
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,630
South Americans of that promised limit can be connected to the

167
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,870
people who American Canadian

168
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,050
then I wrote name o three k2

169
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,410
automatically I could the names

170
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,660
that come closest  to that name

171
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,670
and all those that contain to 3 kg and

172
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,070
already lost

173
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,220
there are disturbances from which I can skim

174
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,040
which name I heard I get

175
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,780
closer to what I think the last

176
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,400
goal let's take the example that has three

177
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,840
k the eight matically I write at 3 k

178
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,150
listen for a moment is forced to listen to it

179
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,520
again and by pressing the space due it

180
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,540
already automatically sets the parameter 2

181
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,880
also a context must be

182
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,500
passed usually parameters that must be

183
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,770
confirmed its log files then the race

184
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,510
for which these parameters are passed

185
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,000
the side of the connection in  this case

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,100
you pass the let's call them the province for

187
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,360
which the province of the

188
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,940
connection or the state did not pass, sorry that

189
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,040
ab  we connected

190
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,160
on the other numerical side did

191
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,710
this in the first mile it is

192
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:24,070
automatically on the

193
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,930
next screens that we see here we can

194
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,140
now see the connections are few

195
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,120
but here we will see after ten connections

196
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,700
the average of these works that

197
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,440
connection money so how much the

198
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,300
connections are now  easy how many

199
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,360
points are now doing also able to

200
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,580
make a game for which we see in the hours

201
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,720
the links that have been copied

202
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,270
the interesting thing

203
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,530
about this but sorry you see that pia

204
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,490
pennsylvania so at the state the

205
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,980
interesting thing is that in which some

206
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,700
windows we see  that the

207
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,110
multiplier this and multiplier

208
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,540
and we have already said it at this moment

209
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,450
is worth connected we are missing in all the

210
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,740
other frequencies what you see here

211
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,090
are thrown frequencies that are

212
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,510
used to make the races so in

213
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,460
this case with this link

214
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,170
moment in 40  meters is not duplicated is a

215
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,880
multiplier and we made three points

216
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,460
by entering  the names po at a time k1

217
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,220
this is another one that I forced

218
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,740
in fact it is delivered to me with a

219
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,470
multiplier and to the second question but

220
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,250
it is not multiplied and we go on

221
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,660
film end of the race the race

222
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,140
will be frozen log file that sent to the

223
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:06,740
committee  who manages the race will

224
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,120
then draw up the rankings the organ formed which

225
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,360
is called cabrillo this format is

226
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,100
inserted on a pc where it checks

227
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,710
and crosses the data of a

228
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,870
connection with another if I have

229
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,600
connected k1 and chase them at that time

230
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,980
Absolute then as you can see the

231
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,990
log file menu has also marked then it will go to

232
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,540
see if you do not log of k1 and Chinese

233
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,520
ste and if it has sent it if that

234
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,790
link exists also be connected the

235
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,620
callsign and all the rest of the world

236
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,030
has not connected with  the reason there is

237
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,160
something that the web because it could

238
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,540
be that it has marked it wrong

239
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,340
because on the only one the world that has

240
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,470
connected that tends to

241
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,030
most keep it combines well

242
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,790
but you  they report it as the only

243
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,860
connection in the world so with a

244
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,810
crusader all these data are removed

245
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,360
this erroneous that happens and

246
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,230
automatically off the score up

247
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,800
to the ranking

248
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:28,279
I said before that it was possible to

249
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,509
connect to a cluster from on this

250
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:32,329
is not connected to the internet

251
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:34,319
but this window is possible

252
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:38,399
also connect plates and through the

253
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,839
internet and tell him look that it is one of

254
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,209
these there are various sites that give

255
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:47,759
clustering you can

256
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,790
automatically select me in the

257
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:58,740
cluster window I see on this window I can

258
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,660
go and filter what interests me

259
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,930
for example if you are only looking for

260
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,259
someone the band  of the twenty meters

261
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:10,230
I only had the callsigns of people

262
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,189
who know on that frequency

263
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,880
so it can be useful and double clicking

264
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,920
on the call sign automatically sets

265
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,070
the person to connect the

266
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,649
excuse the device automatically on that

267
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:36,019
frequency other in reality a set of

268
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:37,940
options  this program that I am not here

269
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,630
to explain to you except

270
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,750
in the public administration  they are explained but let's see

271
00:13:53,750 --> 00:14:01,970
if there are also commands for

272
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,470
example I said before that it is possible to

273
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,350
make a call automatically

274
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,850
this call can be automatically

275
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,490
paid manually that is I press f1 and

276
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,910
he but the transmission makes the call

277
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,650
but every time you have to press are  I

278
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,990
can if such with the command and kidnapped

279
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,970
that I write here writes to republic

280
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,400
a window appears michele how many

281
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:22,940
seconds

282
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,240
I usually put 4 seconds the veil ok

283
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,740
at that point he begins to make a

284
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,960
call and every 4 seconds he does it again

285
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,670
automatically

286
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,680
until I in  direction not for me if

287
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,090
I hear someone I press it

288
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,150
goes out automatically the reception stops

289
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,620
sorry the board stops and I can

290
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,060
make the connection eboli that you were

291
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,950
award ceremony resume it makes the call

292
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:47,139
every 4 seconds so there are all 17

293
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:48,699
uplifting or if I write

294
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:51,220
the frequency directly of course

295
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,189
the apparatus which has always been connected the cat

296
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:56,859
writes the frequency 14200 brings me the

297
00:14:56,859 --> 00:15:00,220
parade operationally at 14200 not only

298
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,929
approx  mbiare banda writes it directly into

299
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:04,299
milk file

300
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:06,879
there is a series of commands that can be used

301
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:11,470
on this entry where it is possible to

302
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:24,569
select and modify some

303
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,199
functions I can also send

304
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,449
messages elsewhere I am here

305
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:33,429
I make a connection I am  on the band

306
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:34,660
of 40

307
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,339
and here there is another one on the band of winds

308
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:39,429
is a multiplier for me on 20 because

309
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:42,309
I realize that I don't have it here

310
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,889
so the one didn't open I need it I

311
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:46,689
tell him on 20

312
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:48,759
meters I tell him to the correspondent look that

313
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,399
then move on 20 meters

314
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,709
and he sends him a message to

315
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:55,600
the other I tell him look that on the 20 meters that

316
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,339
this person will arrive or he can

317
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:59,290
also force the radio to him I

318
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,970
automatically put the radio of that person on the

319
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,439
right frequency to call the person

320
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:07,860
I do not have  put video however to give you an idea

321
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,629
of how it works possibly wood

322
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:12,639
where there is the standa a stop arrives the

323
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,529
video of what happens during a contest

324
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:17,079
of certain levels just 48 hours there

325
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:19,809
will be 16 20 lost  ne who work

326
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:23,559
continuously on 45 radios various

327
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,619
connections

328
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:28,149
if there are as gathered the time if there

329
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:30,569
are questions

330
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,980
to those who asked on saturday his name is paolo the

331
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,720
k3 acqua r

332
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,760
and he is from mestre so from the ari section

333
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,750
of mestre

334
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,750
everything here is free freeware that you can

335
