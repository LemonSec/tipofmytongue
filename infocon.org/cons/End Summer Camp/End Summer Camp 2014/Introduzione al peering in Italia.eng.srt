1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,780
we will quickly explain

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,639
we will see what peering is what it

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,269
means how the networks parts of the internet

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,379
exchange traffic and then we will see

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,539
how the traffic exchange between

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,420
Italian networks

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,490
is organized internet is a set of

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,050
independent networks without any particular

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,289
formal or substantial coordination for

10
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,500
everything about routing, that is,

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,890
the exchange of information on the

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,960
directions that the traffic must take,

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,770
you will find the other, as there is no one

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,640
higher than the others that coordinates

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,700
this, there must be

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,079
typically bilateral agreements between the

17
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,010
networks so that a network of ca all  'other

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,820
for which one entity

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,270
tells the other for which networks in the sense of pp wants to

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,060
receive traffic to do this

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,270
technically is the bgp protocol is used

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,979
the border gateway protocol version 4

23
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:20,100
with which the border routers say

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,909
the one  the other on my side there are

25
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,150
these re pp I can receive in traffic

26
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,270
the other side can decide

27
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,369
okay I accept I accept that you m  i say

28
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,600
that these networks are on the other side

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,950
eventually then i will send you the traffic

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,759
which are subsequent decisions there are

31
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,590
different possible types of

32
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,630
interconnection per second depending

33
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,710
on the relationship between

34
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,479
the entity in question for example I

35
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,510
can have a customer who pays me

36
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,990
because  take away its traffic

37
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,790
stop of the internet that is trivially

38
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,919
a square any

39
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,230
ADSL access connection etc.

40
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,410
but also in general practically

41
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,000
any operator must have one

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,790
possibly more suppliers what

43
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,610
is called transit i.e. forward

44
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,370
their traffic to the rest of the internet

45
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,100
transit providers provide

46
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,970
this service their customers

47
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,470
where this chain ends

48
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,170
transit supplier customer may have

49
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,440
other transit providers in turn at the

50
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,590
top of the pyramid there are 12 15 networks

51
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,700
that are called taiwan that

52
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,060
exchange traffic entirely pre of them

53
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,500
without  have none without using

54
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,480
any other network to reach and

55
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,829
others

56
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:11,920
this is called peering and exists both

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,880
at the upper level

58
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,760
of the traffic pyramid, but also at

59
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,310
the lower levels, two networks can

60
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,959
agree to ensure that the

61
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:28,299
traffic between them does not pass through a

62
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:31,000
transit provider but through a

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,540
direct interconnection  this traffic

64
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,970
can be exchanged for free

65
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,940
or in exchange for money as

66
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,000
appropriate, peering is an agreement that

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,140
governs both from a

68
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,299
technical and a commercial point of view

69
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:50,140


70
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,620
if there is an exchange of money which

71
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,890
traffic is exchanged between two networks  it is

72
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,799
precisely a bilateral relationship because it

73
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,169
concerns two networks that exchange

74
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,299
traffic exclusively between

75
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:07,630
themselves and that of their customers does not

76
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,750
replace transit to the rest

77
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,310
of the world

78
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,199
because it concerns traffic

79
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:17,798
to the other network and their customers not

80
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:20,220
to the rest  of the internet in general

81
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,120
can be either an informal agreement cc is

82
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,960
met and it is said well let's exchange

83
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,780
traffic  or or it can be governed

84
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,150
by a contract that is in some cases also

85
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,389
extremely complicated for example the

86
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:39,880
dozen or so Thai air one

87
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,320
between them have extremely strict peering contracts

88
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,880


89
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,760
also because each tries to avoid

90
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,860
that its competitor is in

91
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,139
some way an advantage and  there may

92
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,199
be clauses such as for example

93
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,180
we have to exchange traffic in

94
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,540
four continents in seven of these

95
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,780
nine cities on circuits of certain

96
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,240
dimensions that will always be maintained

97
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,790
with a certain percentage of

98
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,660
free capacity and so on

99
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,810
instead generally between the

100
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,380
smaller networks  no

101
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,210
formalities of this kind are necessary simply

102
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,949
we agree to exchange

103
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,000
traffic at present from an economic point of view

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,509
the peering can be either sepia while or for a

105
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:32,320
fee

106
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,260
in the case of peering settlement free

107
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,110
it is decided that both parties

108
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,260
agree they agree on the fact  that it is

109
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,320
currently useful to exchange

110
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,570
traffic so I don't think  It is not necessary

111
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,990
for one party to compensate the other

112
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,200
otherwise if one of the two parties

113
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,820
deems it does not have a particular

114
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,040
advantage in establishing a

115
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,100
direct connection with another network

116
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,680
then it will decide that if this other network

117
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,510
wants to have a direct inter connection

118
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,410
with it

119
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,030
always to exchange  your

120
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,620
traffic can be paid for from a technical point of

121
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,230
view there are basically

122
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,590
two large categories of interconnections

123
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,970
there is public peering in which

124
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,450


125
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,240
all interested parties are not internet

126
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,200
exchanges arriving with their own circuits

127
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,110
and connecting to the

128
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,830
internet exchange switches where c  'it is more or less

129
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,190
than an ethernet network in which your

130
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,640
routers are connected to each other

131
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,710
speak bgp not necessarily everyone

132
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,670
speaks to everyone

133
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,160
this is a platform that allows you to

134
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,940
meet

135
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,020
each other and then decide with whom you want to

136
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,420
talk the alternative is the  pierre in

137
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,440
private you take a

138
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,170
direct circuit between two locations of the two

139
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,140
entities  à that they exchange traffic and in

140
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,420
this regard only they are not

141
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,110
lost there who participate in this

142
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,710
one choose one the other solution

143
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,230
mainly according to

144
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:28,420
technical reasons for for quantities of data

145
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,810
let's say relatively small

146
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,370
it is not convenient to

147
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,520
create a new each for

148
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,160
direct connection instead  you see an inter in the

149
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,360
backstage there is no particular

150
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,840
relationship between trucks in public and private and

151
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,610
paid peering per night

152
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,030
these cases can be

153
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,210
easily mixed in various combinations

154
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,150
because you are peering there are excellent

155
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,850
technical reasons for peering with

156
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,830
a  'other network

157
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,070
meanwhile the local traffic from one city to

158
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,640
another from one nation to another

159
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,180
remains local does not make long routes

160
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,660
this means that the traffic between the

161
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,390
two networks will have a lower latency which a

162
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,760
useful thing for many applications

163
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,920
we think gaming holl did tera  but in

164
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,560
general it is also a useful thing for

165
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,180
web traffic

166
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,210
at this point and we know the latency

167
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,419
of the of a conne  ssion affects in a

168
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,870
certain way the speed with which

169
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,510
the web page finally arrives in the

170
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,320
browser so there are some entities

171
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,900
I cite for a trivial example google who

172
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,670
want to get as close as possible to

173
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,740
those who visit their sites in order to

174
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,420
offer the best

175
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,480
possible performance  It is also interesting to note that as

176
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,480
long as the local local traffic lives in

177
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,670
other jurisdictions,

178
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,520
if the traffic to get from my

179
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,670
network to another network maybe goes around

180
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,010
Germany for the United Kingdom

181
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,070
for France as it can sometimes happen

182
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,050
unfortunately it means that with

183
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,750
traffic  by train to another country where

184
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,050
perhaps it can be intercepted according

185
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,880
to the laws in force in that

186
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,290
country but not only if my traffic between

187
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,680
me and another network, even if it does not leave me out of

188
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,760
Italy, is conveyed by a

189
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,290
third carrier

190
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,149
which however has  based in another country

191
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:51,660
this company will be regardless of

192
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,339
what the Italian laws are it will

193
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,009
also be subject to the laws of that other

194
00:09:56,009 --> 00:10:00,079
country it is useful ten  It is always present

195
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:03,269
from a technical point of view,

196
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,009
however, it is a good idea to invite

197
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,440
your traffic to pass through the networks of

198
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,490
others

199
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,839
this allows greater

200
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,279
reliability

201
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,160
there are fewer points in the chain

202
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,290
that can break which can

203
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,699
cause problems

204
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:26,370
direct traffic on occasions of

205
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:31,319
generally there will be this then it

206
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:34,079
also allows greater control over tg remakes

207
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:34,829
the traffic

208
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:37,170
I could decide that my traffic

209
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,480
to a certain network suits me more

210
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,490
that I take a certain path

211
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,889
within my network of its network that

212
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:45,810
another in this way I know  exactly

213
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,829
since it is only the two of us who does ciro

214
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:52,800
and I can decide it in case of problems

215
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,240
since it is always me and the other network it

216
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,480
will be much easier to investigate there

217
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,540
because we can talk to each other directly in the

218
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,160
meantime we know that there is no one in

219
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,560
between when there is  is someone in between I

220
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,569
assure you that it can also be very

221
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:12,990
complicated to investigate an

222
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,660
end to end connectivity problem

223
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,990
everyone must ini  to put in the

224
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,269
field technicians of their own

225
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:24,779
transit provider who will have to convince themselves that

226
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,720
there is a problem that does not depend on

227
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,420
their customers but perhaps depends on

228
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,550
their own network or on the network of another

229
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,139
transit supplier with whom they

230
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:36,870
turn to which I will not be able to speak

231
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,649
directly  since they are not their customers,

232
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,000
this risks making them

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,170
waste a lot of time the public pirin is

234
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,560
very convenient because it arrives at the internet

235
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,930
exchange I pay

236
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,250
what is the cost per sun is a member in

237
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,070
italy in the internet exchange are all

238
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,740
consortia that are substantially if

239
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,830
without purpose  for practical purposes

240
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,630
and the consortia to the GDP

241
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,339
in general are all non-

242
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,160
profit and may have different corporate forms

243
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,080
but the practical effect this

244
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,649
each member is and affects the

245
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,390
decisions that

246
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,330
regarding the organization after having

247
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,660
paid I carry the  my cable is connected

248
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,260
to the switch to the switches depending on the dl

249
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,450
of how big the network of the inter  net

250
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,120
exchange more or less redundant and I am

251
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,709
ready to exchange traffic with

252
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,410
anyone who wants to exchange it with me and

253
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,570
convenient because in this way I do not have to

254
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,910
organize to bring on the circuit

255
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,920
to each of the other networks with which

256
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,830
I want to exchange traffic and it is also

257
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,029
cheaper in the

258
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:01,260
meantime it allows me  to save a thousand

259
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,110
two thousand euros of network port for

260
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,209
each circuit with which I should reach

261
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:08,010
the other operators

262
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,860
instead I only need one port or more

263
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,570
depending on what my

264
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,170
dimensions are and then it also allows me to

265
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,110
size my circuit with which it

266
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,750
arrives  to the exchange on the basis of

267
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,670
what the overall traffic peaks will be,

268
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,250
however, kit of the networks that

269
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,640
I see between me and them while instead if I

270
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,890
arrive with an independent circuit

271
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,110
towards each independent network

272
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,120
I will have to provide

273
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,920
additional capacity on each of these

274
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,209
circuits in order to cope with the

275
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:45,720
sudden and unexpected traffic peaks and

276
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,260
this starts to add up with a lot of

277
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,680
space b  go that I have to leave free

278
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,880
for possible future eventualities on the other

279
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,370
hand if instead with a network I exchange

280
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,660
so much so much traffic then it

281
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,690
can be economically and

282
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,720
technically convenient a direct interconnection

283
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,360
are things that are evaluated according to

284
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,200
the needs of each among the

285
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,240
advantages of peeling  we do not think it

286
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,710
contains economic

287
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,350
this because the costs of transit from

288
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,160
2000 onwards have really collapsed in

289
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:34,030
2000 has revalued a to the cost of living

290
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,050
as a megabit per month which is the unit

291
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,370
of measurement of the cost of the internet band

292
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,610
that is a megabit for the duration  purchased

293
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,960
for the duration of a month it

294
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,450
cost 2,500 3,000 euros now always

295
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,440
a mega biped traffic for a month

296
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,500
costs me between 50 cents a euro and a half

297
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,210
so

298
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,410
the cost varies depending on how

299
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,030
much capacity I undertake to buy

300
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,000
these from my supplier  pairs of

301
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,490
values are respectively the prices of

302
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,540
a gigabit of 10 gigabit traffic

303
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,610
then there is also a certain variability per

304
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,620
second  and in supplier to the other of

305
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,290
its quality and other issues which

306
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,810
market is it clearly costs me less to

307
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,510
buy band in Milan than to buy it in

308
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,000
Palermo where my supplier has to

309
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,770
arrive with longer circuits where

310
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,350
maybe it will have much less market for which

311
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,750
less economies of scale and so  on the

312
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,800
other hand, the cost of peering is lower

313
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,350
than the cost of transit which is one of the

314
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,470
reasons why peering is done, however, these

315
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,090
are truly

316
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,240
negligible savings for a small network

317
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,940


318
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,710


319
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,210
.

320
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,360
this is not why people do

321
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,530
peering do peering for the reasons we

322
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,810
have seen before

323
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,490
improves the quality of traffic

324
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,820
allows you to better control it allows you

325
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,800
to intervene more easily in

326
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,600
case of

327
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,790
problems there are three main internet exchanges in Italy

328
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,030
I am a mix of Milan that even the

329
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,570
oldest na mix of Rome and Topix of

330
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,600
Turin later present because in Turin

331
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,580
also in all the other provinces  and in

332
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,840
Piedmont there is a ring of fibers

333
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,880
provided by the Piedmont region that

334
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,160
interconnects the various offices in this

335
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,380
way possible to connect in

336
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,230
different points this is used by

337
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,700
many local operators that make wifi and

338
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,140
operators of a specific area that

339
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,240
have their presence only there

340
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,620
this  it is very convenient because it

341
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,600
allows him to interconnect without

342
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,340
going directly with a

343
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,490
dedicated circuit in turin as well as in milan

344
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,860
other exchanges are tix di firenze

345
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,410
at the headquarters of the tuscan region of

346
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,040
six in padua from mix of in bari mi knapp

347
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,230
that the exchange is alternative of  milan

348
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,990
managed by me and a mix of palermo that

349
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,060
none of you probably know

350
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,920
because as soon as you arrive I don't even

351
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,819
think there are already active networks the first three

352
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,609
altogether between them

353
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,260
before the beginning of the summer they did

354
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:31,240
250 gb of traffic others is negligible

355
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,080
in  comparison 250 gb

356
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,010
said between us there are not many

357
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,830
compared with the large European

358
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,740
markets where there is a traffic exchange  both

359
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,770
national and international

360
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,680
beck x9 priest rabbit hamsik a

361
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,539
little less

362
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:56,879
links two once linz and hamsik 5 6

363
00:17:56,879 --> 00:18:01,710
years ago they played the first

364
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,919
place then there was a big

365
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,019
slowdown of the internet in london

366
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,090
trivially because the space was run out and

367
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,489
docklands it  space the current until

368
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:13,200
new data centers have been built

369
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,940
in these s inge a lot of

370
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,489
traffic is exchanged because not only

371
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:22,950
national traffic is exchanged but there are also

372
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,889
many foreign networks that arrive

373
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:28,019
there to exchange traffic with other

374
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,599
foreign networks for example the company for

375
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,999
whose work has a connection to

376
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:36,179
hamsik the kinks but a lot of traffic

377
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,609
because many networks arrive from eastern

378
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:43,259
europe from russia also links arrive

379
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:47,159
many networks in down tubes they arrive

380
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,259
rapidly to the middle east also from the

381
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:52,200
united states also in the italians

382
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,669
some foreign networks arrive

383
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:56,220
however for how  the internet market works and

384
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,279
in europe they come to italy to

385
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,769
exchange traffic with non italian networks

386
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:04,369
to exchange it among themselves for evidently geographical reasons they

387
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:06,179


388
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,979
prefer to exchange it in more central places

389
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:10,259


390
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:12,239
there are also private pierins in italy

391
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:15,749
however mainly for the

392
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:18,950
largest operators in telecom italia

393
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,679
assures me surely because

394
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,019
he has a direct knowledge of it peering with

395
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:29,429
wind and fastweb and batteries  xvi netter wind

396
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:32,279
and fastweb have private peering between

397
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:32,669
them

398
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:35,279
google has private peering with

399
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,410
practically all

400
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,430
medium-large access networks

401
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,830
including the race to say they

402
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,780
are not necessarily symmetrical if you

403
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,790
try to make sure that one side can and

404
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,120
the other this that is  this means that

405
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,770
the traffic does not know how to say together it passes from

406
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:52,950
there

407
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,900
but in another direction I will do another

408
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,060
round maybe for a transit

409
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,150
this can be trivially due to configuration errors out-

410
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,190
of-

411
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,900
date configurations that need to be

412
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,570
revised with the evolution of each

413
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,330
network  but also for reasons of capacity if

414
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,690
I know that on a certain circuit I am a

415
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,500
risk of saturation then in the time

416
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,690
it takes me to be able to organize

417
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,330
the upgrade make sure to take away the

418
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,860
traffic send it to another part

419
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,110
in Italy also missing in all the

420
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,000
Italian networks they exchange traffic for

421
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,700
theirs there are cases in which

422
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,740
for example,

423
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,040
mobile operators in particular are not seen directly I do not know

424
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,050
why but they do not exchange traffic

425
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,270
three of them probably do not

426
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,480
consider it useful because mobile

427
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,670
phones for what is the state

428
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,400
of mobile technology rarely make

429
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,630
traffic between them

430
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,400
so for example  I saw that

431
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,760
vodafone and three see each other through their

432
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,590
respective transits in this case it

433
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,360
seems to me to be level 3 also fiscal Italy

434
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,090
not peering with some of these

435
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,960
operators fishing Italy up to two years

436
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,440
ago had a very

437
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,390
restrictive peering policy in the sense  who practice

438
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,490
was peering with no one because it had

439
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,180
become at some point 12 15 years ago

440
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,810
part of pi skal international a

441
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,540
gl network  very large obale with a

442
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,250
very restrictive peering policy

443
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,740
so he had closed all peering

444
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,650
with practically all the Italian networks

445
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,170
after which no one for a decade

446
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,210
has ever bought him transit again because

447
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,950
everyone is tied to his finger this

448
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,460
thing but these things happen  the

449
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,000
networks

450
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,510
i small ve while instead for a year and a

451
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,030
half now it has started

452
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,490
to ping again because a few years ago

453
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,040
tiscali international had been sold

454
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,100
it changed its name 3 4 times in the meantime

455
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,960
now an independent network that no

456
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,880
longer has anything to do with either  on

457
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,860
the

458
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,510
other hand, the smaller tensions networks

459
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,940
are well connected with one another,

460
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,460
even three pure france

461
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,980
change namex and mix is generally because

462
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,080
a presence in piedmont always

463
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,450
topix too because a presence in

464
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,100
piedmont topix is extremely useful

465
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,770
because a platform that is used

466
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:34,890
for how is a platform that is

467
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,450
used both for peering but also to

468
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,940
sell transit because co  However it is not

469
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,060
forbidden two networks can meet

470
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,820
on the topix switch platform

471
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,160
and decide that one provides transit to the

472
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,230
other and then last July

473
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,930
telecom italia has very few

474
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,580
interconnections with the other Italian networks

475
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,150


476
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:02,030
this due to their decision to

477
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,410
close most of them.  of these

478
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:08,220
interconnections on the basis of

479
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,720
unclear criteria never

480
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,960
explicitly defined but which were

481
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,970
explained to us by our sales representative because

482
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,890
we had 4 interconnections with

483
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,420
telecom italia at the time of exchanging

484
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,300
stories at this point they decided to

485
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,820
want to exchange traffic only between

486
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,540
networks that  they can be like them who

487
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,110
have many customers intended as

488
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:41,910
ADSL customers access networks and

489
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:47,310
brunini practical similarly an ADSL and

490
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:51,870
asymmetric a provider that has

491
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:56,280
substantially ADSL customers or in

492
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,890
general circuits in which upload and

493
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,910
download do not have the same ability to

494
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,760
consequence it will have asymmetric traffic q towards the outside of

495
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,480
its network

496
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,390
his already to think that this

497
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,679
criterion perhaps has some problems

498
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,870
all in a more rapid way means that

499
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,750
for telecom it intends to

500
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,750
peer only with the large

501
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,270
access operators substantially only with those

502
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,240
with whom it already did private peering in

503
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,650
fact the decision had also been made

504
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,410
to disconnect from the

505
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:38,520
internet exchange the problem after they

506
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,410
noticed that they cannot disconnect

507
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,030
from the internet exchanges because in Italy

508
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,510
there is something managed by agcom and

509
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,160
the ugo bordoni foundation which is called

510
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,840
internet measure

511
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,760
you connect to the downloaded site a

512
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,010
program that measures how well the

513
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,500
your dsl works how much bandwidth asia

514
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,490
problems etc.

515
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:00,300
this program connects to the food servers

516
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,990


517
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,570
that are in the internet exchanges for which

518
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,730
those who actually remained in the

519
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,950
internet exchanges exchanging

520
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,170
traffic with practically no one but

521
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,880
their initial idea was to have only

522
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,620
private full just for the  their new

523
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,530
peers have said they want  only

524
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,020
private pirin and only paid peering

525
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,760
obviously not free if you are not

526
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,890
part of that small group of companies that

527
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,650
we have discussed and it is interesting to note

528
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:35,190
that the peering costs that have been

529
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,250
proposed for this product are

530
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,370
greater than what it would cost to

531
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,920
buy transit, i.e. access to  the whole

532
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,470
internet instead of just

533
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,450
telecom italia customers by telecom

534
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,820
italia sparkle which is the

535
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,320
international network the backbone

536
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,030
of telecom italia's international the year one

537
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,530
is also interesting that this

538
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,040
price is actually won because trying

539
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,440
to discuss the issue with  the

540
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,210
telecom salesmen

541
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,970
are so eager to sell the

542
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:13,020
product that they give it to you that they

543
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,120
give it means at no cost but it

544
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,280
means I will give you a

545
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,170
corresponding discount on another thing you

546
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,360
buy me that a very common thing in

547
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,600
negotiations with telecom italia I have to say

548
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,690
in  anyway we don't know exactly

549
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,210
which networks

550
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,700
qualify for pe  ering set while with

551
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,610
telecom italia national that the

552
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,460
assistant tone 269 because they

553
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,500
never published them they never explained

554
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,620
it clearly

555
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,840
telecom italia a2 tone system note

556
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,660
system is a concept that defines a

557
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,420
group of ruperts who have a common

558
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,130
routine policy  this is the

559
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,250
definition more in practice in this

560
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,400
case telecom italia 2 ott non system x

561
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,040
269 that the national network what was

562
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,710
once called in for business and 6 7

563
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,380
6 2 which is

564
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,210
international network for telecom italia

565
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,820
sparkle which is a suit go a

566
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,820
huge very important backbone

567
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,440
that covers the whole world has a

568
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,300
particular penetration in

569
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,620
latin america and towards the middle east and beyond

570
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,960
itself in the interconnections not for

571
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,510
national telecom italia there are

572
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,000
certainly for private individuals with wind and

573
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,700
fastweb who were here and ynet who were

574
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,250
already those

575
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,380
I know that there is an interconnection with

576
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,960
vodafone which from my analysis I believe

577
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,870
is a peer and in private

578
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:51,140
there are peering on the  masti standing at

579
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,580
namex there is the one congar immediately the

580
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,250
telecom executives thought they were

581
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,840
proposing paid peering also

582
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,050
agar I would have liked to be present

583
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,210
when they proposed me then

584
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,950
someone I think he pointed

585
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,260
out that they would not receive a

586
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,030
positive response  so they didn't even

587
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:14,210
try and then with the part of bp

588
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:17,780
which was the former dawn with suspicion that they are

589
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,390
still in question because sooner or later he

590
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,490
has to end up defending himself with the part of

591
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,380
bp that was the former inept so for now

592
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,120
they have the sand a  instead it has always

593
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,250
had full and private and therefore that

594
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,230
they have left things so waiting

595
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,860
for technical developments and then telecom italia

596
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,630
some networks and of

597
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,390
significant size that are their customers are

598
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:43,670
their customers even historically not in the

599
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:47,630
sense that they use them to

600
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,910
interconnect as  transit to

601
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,280
reach the rest of the world but

602
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,960
who give him money for this

603
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,210
interconnection ciampi and privately

604
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,810
infracom and aruba I know for sure  that

605
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,150
there is a relationship of this kind

606
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,010
interoute

607
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,100
no one is quite convinced and even

608
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,500
tiscali italia instead telecom italia

609
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,690
sparkle has a rather particular peering policy,

610
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,400


611
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,040
meanwhile it is a very restrictive policy

612
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,810
which is completely normal for a

613
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:23,570
one by one suit tends to peer with

614
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,510
very few networks  very large in

615
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:29,480
their size or a little less

616
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,080
but telecom italia sparkle does not peer

617
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,590
in italy online than ever then

618
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,930
historically no then napapijri that

619
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,210
italian corep because that knew and

620
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,030
telecom italia national has always done

621
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,940
very little peering in italy for

622
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,310
their strategic decision  that I was

623
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,130
told in these terms I do not want to

624
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,110
give access to the Italian market to these

625
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,120
other networks I want them to take a

626
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,790
longer tour passing by me this because

627
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,820
there is an interconnection between telecom

628
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,620
italia national for the like italia

629
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,570
sparkle which is in milan

630
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,870
if  a customer of telecom italia sparkle

631
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,570
from palermo there are several are

632
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,190
that  them who arrive on their

633
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,350
submarine cables from the middle east

634
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:19,450
interconnect wants to receive them and wants to

635
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,300
send receive send traffic with a

636
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,060
national telecom italia customer in

637
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,120
rome in southern italy everywhere in italy

638
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,010
in any case their traffic passes through

639
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,960
milan because this is their only

640
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,300
interconnection once there was a

641
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,270
rome but then for their internal reasons that

642
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,750
do not create completely even their

643
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,350
staff had been turned off so what

644
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,390
are the interconnections between telecom

645
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,580
italia sparkle and other suppliers of

646
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,180
tailleur lunches or have similar in italy

647
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,520
c '  it is gpp the ex pinete xing bellico in teak

648
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,100
skal international ex di scalia changed

649
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,240
not the masters over the years in milan

650
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,180
but he has a problem there are four for 10

651
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,540
gigabits the circuits and are full they are

652
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,220
full for about two years abundant

653
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,730
telecom italia cannot

654
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,390
has  refused for a long time

655
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,220
to upgrade they continued to

656
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,260
open their interconnections

657
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,130
all over the world

658
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,020
in Italy but no to me  lano did not

659
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,470
talk about it until one

660
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,630
of the tinet commercials told me this and I have no doubt

661
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:35,100
that it is true they asked for a certain

662
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,380
amount to be able to upgrade the

663
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,720
Italian interconnections a certain

664
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,230
disproportionate amount that was not

665
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,900
accepted as far as I know  in fact

666
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,870
traffic stages 3 cpp and telecom italia

667
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,600
passes through milan part passes through

668
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,350
frankfurt part part passes through paris

669
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:59,340
lpp level 3 are two new entries and the

670
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,740
ppi arrived last year on the italian market

671
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,600


672
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,070

673
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,190
a npp connectivity provider  it is the

00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,320
Japanese telco also this is a

675
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,740


676
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,220
very important suit one entered the market

677
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,070
or and after a while it was able to activate a

678
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,880
bearing with telecom italia because

679
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,240
for reasons of reciprocity it works like this

680
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,640
ndp to give peering to telecom italia

681
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,370
sparkle and in other parts of the world it was

682
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,860
able  expect to have peering

683
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,200
with telecom italia sparkle and also on

684
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,040
the Italian level trick market and instead

685
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,929
also their US supplier in

686
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:42,390
extremely important place that is in italy

687
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:47,010
in thaksin pre about it did not have a peering

688
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:50,040
with telecom italia and in italy while

689
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,870
instead of course in the rest of the world they

690
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,270
are the year one they exchange traffic

691
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,480
between them except that in italy they

692
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,890
managed to have peering with with

693
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:02,610
sparkle

694
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:09,150

with the same thanks to the same

698
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:18,729
reciprocity method to make sure that to

699
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:20,590
keep their peering and in other

700
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,159
regions

701
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:22,869
telecom italia sparkle had to

702
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:25,330
agree to do pinning with them too

703
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,970
in italy then there are sprints that belen

704
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,229
wireless from telecom that are not

705
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:34,149
suppliers cuts for relevant on

706
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:36,609
the italian market but for two

707
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:39,669
historical reasons you another year peering with

708
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:41,769
telecom italia sparkle and milan but

709
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:45,970
this does not make them companies from here

710
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,489
it makes sense to go and buy  of the

711
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:51,549
transit inter instead of the big networks

712
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:53,919
extremely important with the gent global

713
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,470
crossing skins to the Swedish incumbent

714
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:01,059
from  t another Indian the year one not

715
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:03,099
years interconnections with telecom italia

716
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:05,139
and in the rest of the world not in italy

717
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:07,989
because they are not strong enough to

718
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:10,449
be able to obtain an interconnection in

719
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:16,149
italy as I said between the two networks

720
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:19,089
telecom italia national telecom itali

721
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:21,510
international there is a single

722
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,619
interconnection  I think 8 by 10

723
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:26,730
gigabit in milan

724
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:30,059
this means that all the traffic

725
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:34,089
between the outside and telecom italia national

726
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:36,940
passes from in to golf and there are

727
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,540
problems

728
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,168
as now the traffic no longer passes

729
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:44,239
through mix and namex it happened

730
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,879
so I did a little  list of

731
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,310
cases that I have personally verified but it is

732
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,649
probable that there are also others

733
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:55,429
that I have not heard about we

734
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:58,400
go from simple things like

735
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,760
packet loss in an interconnection between

736
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,310
telecom italia sparkle ntp after having

737
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,320
activated it last year  it was

738
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,710
immediately saturated and for a long

739
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,430
time I was not using their customers

740
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,860
the npp customers used other

741
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,590
routes because that one  it was that circuit was

742
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,250
full it was completely impossible to get

743
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,900
traffic through without having

744
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,320
complaints from its customers there

745
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,140
were not one but also several cases

746
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,119
of packet loss in the various

747
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,590
interconnections between telecom italia

748
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,490
sparkle

749
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:39,440
egp pp skal international a

750
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,490
rather interesting case black o l  'ing between

751
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,170
telecom italia and telecom italia sparkle

752
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,800
the direct traffic certain p did not pass

753
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,080
and that easy for us I am not a customer of

754
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,090
one or the other

755
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,280
means that I have to contact my

756
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,200
transit provider who will speak to

757
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,180
telecom italia sparkle and so on

758
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,310
alternatively  I have to tell my client that

759
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,619
maybe some servers on my network are a

760
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,140
telecom italia adsl look to

761
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,900
call 187 and explain that in this

762
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,030
point of their network the traffic no

763
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,640
longer passes see a little test if you can

764
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,280
then then let's see in the meantime I move  me too

765
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,380
because I don't expect very sincerely

766
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,940
from that side for 7 10 February

767
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,339
some

768
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:27,559
telecom italia sparkle circuits broke in ge  rmania

769
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,059
then it seems to me that the details had been

770
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:34,190
explained to me informally in retrospect and the

771
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,609
traffic between cogent which is a

772
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:39,979
very important transit provider in italy

773
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:41,989
in general of the world and telecom italia

774
00:36:41,989 --> 00:36:43,089
sparkle

775
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:46,249
I was passing through the united states like 20 years

776
00:36:46,249 --> 00:36:49,789
ago when we were all  the clients of an

777
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:52,369
ep and we all saw each other in virginia

778
00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:54,109
because there were no interconnections in

779
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:56,390
italy and in general not many in

780
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:00,619
europe other cases of congestion 11

781
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:01,910
march

782
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,729
particularly interesting and I mean

783
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:07,670
interesting in the chinese sense between couples

784
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:13,579
dpa my case and telecom italia  traffic did not

785
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:17,239
pass I had some customers

786
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:20,479
who had servers completed on my

787
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:23,900
networks of laurel ip adsl telecom and similar things

788
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,430


789
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,700
certain more were reachable certain no

790
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,039
worth explaining to the customer what is

791
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,809
happening and that it is not my fault if the

792
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:36,289
traffic does not pass other cases  of

793
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:39,979
congestion we have always noticed that

794
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:42,589
the telecom italia sparkle network does not

795
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:45,680
have all this redundancy

796
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,140
when something breaks down it can c  let

797
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,578
another circuit become saturated having

798
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:55,430
said that peering is not

799
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,729
mandatory each network decides

800
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:02,479
who it wants to peer with this is a

801
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:05,150
very important point I do not believe in the peeling

802
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,130
required by law I do not think it

803
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,160
is a good idea

804
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,920
but we must consider another

805
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,489
question of position  dominant

806
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:20,029
telecom italia has 55 per

807
00:38:20,029 --> 00:38:22,789
cent of the ADSL access market in Italy and the

808
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:25,729
like number one to have, like all

809
00:38:25,729 --> 00:38:28,249
the others, a dominant position on

810
00:38:28,249 --> 00:38:30,079
this access market position

811
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,469
certified as a guarantor for

812
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:36,489
competition, etc.

813
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,020


814
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:42,740
position among small them relevant in

815
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,720
certain other markets

816
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,270
for example it has a noteworthy amount

817
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:50,990
of colocation hosting customers but

818
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,690
not very high has a completely

819
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:58,550
negligible position in the cloud market there

820
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,800
are other companies instead of but even

821
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,910
if they may not have a

822
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:05,900
dominant position  however, they have

823
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,840
significant market shares in the hosting cloud market

824
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,400
etc.

825
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,170
this is called it is called the

826
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,060
adjacent market compared to that of

827
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,900
connectivity now if the shares of telecom

828
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,390
italia strong of its

829
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,750
dominant position in a certain market

830
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,990
cause disadvantages for its competitor

831
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,880
in an adjacent market

832
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,230
get a lawyer friend to explain

833
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,970
what it is called  this thing

834
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,130
telecom italia traffic on empire in public

835
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:41,060
the huge join we know that

836
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,160
most of the traffic what is

837
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,350
peer to peer video etc.

838
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,500
this kind of traffic does not tend

839
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,370
to be directed between an access network

840
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,890
is the kind of  and of companies with which

841
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,990
the facts of in private with google are filled in public

842
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:00,290
because youtube new

843
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,570
amounts of traffic in hands even if

844
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,730
telecom italia does not have a peer in private

845
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:09,260
with google and then traffic is exchanged

846
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,720
between the access networks  because

847
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,090
their customers use peer to peer a to

848
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:18,680
exchange debian cds around 20c from

849
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,940
vip and traffic

850
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,940
last year was is plus or minus 10

851
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,630
percent of the  traffic exchanged on the

852
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,750
internet and Italian seats of these 20

853
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,270
giga lippok hominids half were the

854
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:36,410
traffic of acam aia topix akamai has a

855
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:40,940
one-way topix node at one of the

856
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,500
consortium members

857
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,140
of the turin internet exchange that

858
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,240
moves a lot of traffic and memory was

859
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,280
particularly much towards  telecom

860
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,390
italia because telecom never wanted to

861
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,850
have the akamai servers that are cash

862
00:40:55,850 --> 00:41:00,440
that provide part of the traffic all

863
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,930
the traffic of their customers' sites

864
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,140
on national this as

865
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,970
a strategic decision in which they believe

866
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,520
very much while instead they have you on

867
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,140
the telecom network  italia sparkle

868
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,850
this means that telecom italia

869
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:17,120
national had to pay

870
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,890
telecom italia sparkle internally

871
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,270
the cost of that traffic that

872
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,950
arrived on what is their only

873
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:25,280
transit after 2 peering what

874
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,510
happened

875
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,330
telecom italia makes folds only with the

876
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,740
subjects we have seen  i am

877
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,980
reasonably sure no

878
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:39,080
one no one bought their

879
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,950
pierre product in privat  o they have

880
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:50,290
not even sold to a customer the traffic

881
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:52,850
from most of the Italian networks

882
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:56,450
out of 15 are contained servers etc. to

883
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,610
reach telecom italia in any case

884
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:01,790
pass through milan if all goes well if the bad

885
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,470
passes from abroad which is almost always

886
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,110
frankfurt or paris  where there are the

887
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,910
closest interconnections with other

888
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,390
thai air one do

889
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:15,410
you see if you think that this has

890
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,780
led to an improvement in the quality

891
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,960
of the internet network in italy

892
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,240
i feel like saying that in any case it

893
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,780
is not possible that this is ganso there

894
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,810
was globally  an improvement

895
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:34,040
on the other hand not even huge problems

896
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,020
apart from all the reliability issues

897
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,450
we have seen when there are

898
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,010
no contingent problems

899
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,110
everything works the same no

900
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,570
customer of mine has ever said and but it takes

901
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,610
15 thousand seconds more because the

902
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:50,240
traffic between us  goes to frankfurt

903
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,870
no one has ever complained on the other hand

904
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:59,120
another company I know that those who work

905
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,550
and not in a different market always of the  a

906
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,710
co hosting location but a different type of

907
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:07,100
customers in particular to many

908
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,500
gameservers on their network and

909
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,600
their customers had told me they

910
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,880
complained about this because the clamp

911
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,650
had increased that an important thing

912
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:20,600
netgaming was worth it I say  it

913
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:20,870


914
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,430
is clear that no one has earned it

915
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,530
then telecom italia has not sold

916
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:29,930
anything even if it had sold a

917
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,870
very fast account but if it had managed

918
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,450
to sell transit to half of the networks with

919
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,880
which the first peering cruise it

920
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,490
would not have returned to the costs of the circuits

921
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:43,340
and  of the equipment that he would

922
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,230
need to establish all these

923
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,900
private PRIs the same account is very

924
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,970
amicably confirmed to me

925
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:52,790
by colleagues who work for telecom

926
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,460
italia so we can be

927
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,980
quite sure of this as regards

928
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,380
the Italian networks this operation is

929
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,960
economically a loss  net for

930
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,810
telecom because he actually

931
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,820
installed some routers to the mix to

932
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,850
be able to do  private peering with other

933
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:13,090
people willing to reach them

934
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:17,360
privately not on the peering network

935
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,570
of the mix but I understand that they are

936
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,950
completely empty because all this

937
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:29,120
would need a whole other

938
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,050
presentation so we do it shortly it

939
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:36,500
has been clearly said by the managers

940
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,400
responsible for this idea that

941
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,819
they could be paid by two types

942
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:45,069
those over the top

943
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:47,140
the networks that provide services over the

944
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,930
internet have been specifically mentioned

945
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,450
however facebook akamai

946
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:58,329
is missing apple the telco historically

947
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:01,630
since these companies have appeared that

948
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:05,799
have started to make big revenues

949
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:08,200
thanks to the internet

950
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,329
nobody very envious because

951
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:12,640
the connectivity business with

952
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,279
very few margins at tiny margins you

953
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,369
know how little an ADSL pays and I

954
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:22,000
assure you that the little in the end as

955
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,950
revenue and very little remains for the

956
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:25,720
operator who provides the

957
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:31,930
service but beware of trump the revenues of

958
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:35,740
google facebook etc.  they are the

959
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:39,190
same as having  a large turnover

960
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:42,910
the turnover of the over the top is in

961
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,730
any case tiny if compared

962
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,430
worldwide with the turnover of the

963
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:50,410
telcos of the access providers

964
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,480
this means that even if the over

965
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,450
the top ix thought a lot of money

966
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,609
from their earnings

967
00:45:57,609 --> 00:46:01,450
anyway in any case they do not  they could not

968
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:04,510
significantly change the income

969
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,970
statement of telecom italia and other

970
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,190
similar subjects because this idea is not

971
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,099
that they invented it in the skin like

972
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:13,809
there are many others who have tried it

973
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:16,240
before comcast and in the united states and

974
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,240
leaders of this thing to get paid by

975
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,059
those who have content for the privilege of

976
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:24,099
showing them to their customers who

977
00:46:24,099 --> 00:46:28,059
have requested them from Italian providers you will

978
00:46:28,059 --> 00:46:29,910
work Italians in these are

979
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,950
exclusively collateral damage

980
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:36,670
were hit but the targets were very

981
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,829
different

982
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:41,890
if you download these slides then

983
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:45,430
you will see some articles some of mine and

984
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:49,270
others of others  which explain these issues in a little more

985
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:50,980
detail

986
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,920
what is behind them and their ties  ono

987
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,070
with the network neutrality no questions

988
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,379


989
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:17,220
are saturated

990
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,410
but in them because of this big

991
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:25,140
yes we are talking about 20 gigabits for

992
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:30,570
pressing 10 and we also write akamai that

993
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:32,760
a particular case that was largely

994
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,990
in topix we are talking about 2010 gigabits and

995
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,420
csen amex prizes are one  amount of traffic

996
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,170
negligible and for what is the scale of

997
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:54,720
telecom italia yes then the speech

998
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,000
you made can certainly make sense

999
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,619
but the more I can say I can say no

1000
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,650
the real reasons that have been

1001
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,420
explained in part the public in part

1002
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,520
in private are those  that I have listed

1003
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,829
those of and to try to sell not

1004
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:17,369
so much to me but to others and I

1005
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:19,260
ended up in the middle too and like me many

1006
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,240
others and peace worse for him

1007
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:35,490
no I was not clinical

1008
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,770
I certainly agree that I am not plausible  he was

1009
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:39,750
excited because there are these but there

1010
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,520
are these reasons that are much

1011
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,230
stronger in my opinion is amply

1012
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,510
sufficient to justify what

1013
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:54,660
happened said to no one there have been

1014
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,940
endless discussions among other

1015
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:00,210
Italian operators various things have been evaluated

1016
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:03,680
in the end

1017
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,440
practically its problematic stuffed areas

1018
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,720
this situation because we

1019
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,290
have seen the economic difference to give

1020
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:17,580
money to the mit sana mix to move this

1021
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,040
traffic rather than give it to my

1022
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,930
lunches because maybe in  some cases and

1023
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:25,350
telecom italia sparkle does not

1024
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:27,450
particularly move my economics so

1025
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,340
from the point of view of the price no hello

1026
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,770
strong incentive to fight against this

1027
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:35,460
from a technical point of view I

1028
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,020
have mentioned some problems but they have

1029
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,820
been annoying for my customers but

1030
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,880
if they have made a reason not customers

1031
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,859
who have left who have

1032
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,109
threatened me that they have said at least to

1033
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:51,690
be annoyed with me for this

1034
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:52,609
situation

1035
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:55,710
from the discussions I had with

1036
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:57,030
some competitors it

1037
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,070
seems that for them everything is even more

1038
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:01,500
beautiful and therefore if they have  many

1039
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,570
have not told me about the problems

1040
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,970
they also have other different relationships

1041
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:08,160
with telecom it  alia, for example, they sell

1042
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,010
adsl they are telecom italia customers for

1043
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,990
that thing there and they don't want

1044
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,810
to sue telecom italia for that

1045
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,640
considering that in any case there are not

1046
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,859
many holds apart from a cohesion of

1047
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:26,309
competition it has been evaluated to

1048
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:30,299
take legal action in general

1049
00:50:30,299 --> 00:50:33,630
something with agcm guarantor for

1050
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,299
competition on the basis of what is

1051
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:37,650
the dominant position in the

1052
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:41,369
access market for various reasons it was

1053
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:43,799
deemed not to do anything so I do

1054
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:46,289
not expect that there will be differences in the

1055
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:47,729
short term

1056
00:50:47,729 --> 00:50:50,130
maybe sooner or later someone will  fed up

1057
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,549
will buy the peering from telecom italia

1058
00:50:53,549 --> 00:50:56,759
I personally tell them I can also

1059
00:50:56,759 --> 00:50:58,920
accept the excursion we

1060
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,279
agree on what is a price that

1061
00:51:02,279 --> 00:51:05,279
suits me well active inhibit private individuals with

1062
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:07,349
telecom italia I don't make a

1063
00:51:07,349 --> 00:51:09,239
question of cost if they cost me  a

1064
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:11,849
little more than a transit semi

1065
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:14,609
solve problems I have no alternatives I

1066
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:16,109
accept the fact that I have no

1067
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:18,449
alternatives if this proves

1068
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:22,380
necessary l  o I find it annoying for various

1069
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,900
reasons but I have to take what is

1070
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,759
the most advantageous decision for my

1071
00:51:26,759 --> 00:51:27,890
customers

1072
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:30,890
I pray

1073
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,559
if there was and difficult to say because

1074
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:50,680
the network separation would affect the

1075
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,230
purpose of the services at a lower level

1076
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:55,779
than the IP transport so  at

1077
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,789
that point there would be various

1078
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:00,609
telecom italia operators, others who would buy

1079
00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:03,970
from the company that owns the

1080
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:06,250
network access to the twisted pair to the optical fiber

1081
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:09,309
on which to provide ip services

1082
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:11,410
so if telecom italia remained the

1083
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:15,190
one that is less than the physical network it is not

1084
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:17,799
obvious  that something would change even if

1085
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:19,119
in reality the matter is much more

1086
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,769
complex than we can deal with

1087
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:22,240
at the moment

1088
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,220
if telecom italia perhaps broken up into

1089
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,029
several parts maybe it would remain on the one hand

1090
00:52:27,029 --> 00:52:29,799
that the internet on the other hand the data

1091
00:52:29,799 --> 00:52:30,430
centers

1092
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,410
perhaps could review this to

1093
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,680
be incentivized  to revise

1094
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,200
this theory, however, this is unlikely

1095
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,119
because the problem is not that

1096
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,220
someone wants to sell it  space in

1097
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:48,440
your data center with the purpose of

1098
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,230
having more customers in your telecom data center

1099
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:54,049
it was declared

1100
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:57,559
by the executive the public registered by the

1101
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:00,049
executive responsible for this thing

1102
00:53:00,049 --> 00:53:02,059
we have two things to monetize

1103
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:03,589
our network our customers

1104
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:05,299
so if they are the customers the ones to be

1105
00:53:05,299 --> 00:53:09,799
monetize that those who manage the

1106
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:13,190
access network which is the only point to bring

1107
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,430
for the traffic that their customers have

1108
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,769
asked for them is the one who dictates

1109
00:53:18,769 --> 00:53:20,420
the conditions

1110
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:25,430
other questions then all thanks

1111
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:27,650
could already download the slides from

1112
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:29,980
