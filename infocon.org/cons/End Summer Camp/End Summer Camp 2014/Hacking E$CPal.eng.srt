1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:05,460
ok okay then I will try not to get

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,750
too bored since the topic

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,269
obviously does not interest you is spal in

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,460
itself but mine

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,820
indeed during the classic

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,010
press meeting that the idea of making a

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,380
payment system so funny and

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,439
to give a capture came out  the flag with an extra

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,690
gear

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,409
working on the hardware and then

11
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,950
I started to develop

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,290
a business now I'll see what

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,590
makes a secure payment system

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:51,750
magic then basically this

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,590
even if someone had tried it

16
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,989
I think the biggest difficulty

17
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,320
was in the  security obscurity that in

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,810
three days is not with an interest that is not

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,240
not high enough

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,829
does not allow to do the in-

21
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:13,740
depth analyzes and it will [ __ ] be what

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,280
we want a system that works

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,460
three days in a camp full of

24
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,270
hackers up to it and I  put at

25
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,229
instead of 7

26
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,280
a moderate resistance to

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,649
physical attacks so he must be a bit

28
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:33,240
physically robust even if it would not be so much

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,369
because there are only  two types of hackers

30
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,960
just rebus those neo clio who shoot

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,990
and open all things and nerds losers

32
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,020
like us who would have difficulty

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,840
breaking this plastic that is safe

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,259
at least from hackers

35
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:58,100
plus aiac plus lime then tiple cloning which

36
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,270
instead works on tickets

37
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,090
of the bus in Venice worked

38
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,399
for a period practically everything

39
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,140
buy the ticket according to the law you give yourself

40
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,030
inside

41
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,490
he used it the ticket rewrites the data of

42
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,280
when he bought you you could use it

43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,720
upton is talked about in the past years it is

44
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,670
now I think it is closed I'm  st

45
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,500
problem from 25 of April of this year

46
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,500
and it is and it is right so

47
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,780
that it is redundant that there is a

48
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,230
redundancy system because rightly if

49
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,070
someone does some damage trying to

50
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,920
capture the flag rightly then

51
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,140
we will have this actually being the

52
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,459
coin that someone paid

53
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,340
I don't want to end up with a lot of

54
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,200
people who have exes who don't

55
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,960
work and who can't spend

56
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,080
and therefore have to pass out  to offer

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,920
beer to everyone and above all

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,170
a double agent security is essential

59
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,550
so you do not beat innovative cyber fixing

60
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:16,650
so the plan has the basis for

61
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,950
having a functioning system is a

62
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,120
power supply a backup battery or

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,670
used nardino test pieces for

64
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,250
software management a  LCD display and

65
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,900
user interface then

66
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,780
spend a button a buzzer an RFI reader

67
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,140
of which

68
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,660
I do not remember the model but just

69
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,790
look for the arduino rings and find everything

70
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,630
there spa and a micro sd to keep a

71
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,330
database because obviously there is  it's just

72
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,069
a saying of having

73
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,709
almost decent security with an unencrypted tool its

74
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,140
fully open

75
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,020
like these bus tickets

76
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,330
but let's see how it was done inside the

77
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,459
map the memory inside this

78
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:04,240
object is

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,040
a nrf tag of  based on mi wounded

80
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,280
ultralight contains 64 bits of memory

81
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,550
divided into 16 paris with four bikes

82
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,529
each the first two pages are eight

83
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,940
bytes of a serial number for

84
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,649
pr  ogrammed in the factory and therefore not

85
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,029
modifiable

86
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,830
there are four 4-byte configuration bases

87
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,380
of which can be written but

88
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,580
no longer changed

89
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,620
so how much in the program ball which in

90
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,070
this case, however, has not used because

91
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,740
they can be useful but I preferred to

92
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,810
use from the possibility of recycling it and in

93
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,120
any case  I don't know they didn't interest me

94
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,400
they would not have been useful for my purpose

95
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,470
also because someone could have

96
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,640
gone to settle there at all and

97
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,770
invalidate all the exes and we still have

98
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,470
8 bits of useful memory that we can

99
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,700
use to put ourselves inside our

100
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,780
hills among the first  first four pages

101
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,550
were gastronomes so a

102
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,330
random reference is a smile that the

103
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,770
16 but the 03 in ascii and I actually wanted

104
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,670
to put now strange game lions then

105
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,740
movies not to play because in any case

106
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,900
in my opinion it would have given an extra

107
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,680
stimulus a gear in  more to those who wanted to

108
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,820
crack this system and so

109
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,280
we waste 44 pages just to say

110
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,889
hello and then we have the page  8

111
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,240
page 8 contains 0x 15 of the former 15 that

112
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,180
leaves the escape of the escape resca the

113
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,509
charter among other things so right for

114
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:50,370
since they are the former that we have super

115
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,310
reference antani plus 2bite in which

116
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,110
the value in which

117
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,930
the value was stored was stored  of the ex the

118
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,229
scramble value is very simple you flipped

119
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,840
us bytes then you invert the order of the

120
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,860
bits and you do an xor with the ex 1b that

121
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,930
I don't remember why he chose tricks

122
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,240
1b and in this way we could also

123
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,500
see the ex  that through

124
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,090
a mobile application that did not

125
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,270
have time to finish developing

126
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,080
and here the former were contained in two bytes

127
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,040
multiplied by one hundred by the

128
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,020
possibility of having decimals but in the

129
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,890
end in itself

130
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,620
we only used the extensions and then

131
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,180
we have a page  from 9 to 15

132
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,640
someone looked at at least from a

133
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,890
cell phone what was inside none

134
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,230
ok page from 9 to 15 contained random

135
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,170
so we have seven zero gastronomes

136
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,080
then go east and random random because

137
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,340
because that was a bit of a way yes

138
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,470
mpathetic to scam people and pretend that

139
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,230
there was a super

140
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:09,210
antani encryption at 1024 and therefore to make

141
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,220
people bang their heads a bit even if the

142
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,660
huskers were actually written on these

143
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,720
two bytes with a very simple xor already

144
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,870
so they were by the  [ __ ] bike bike

145
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,710
and 2 base ice cream plan on 64

146
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,570
bytes 2bite contained useful information

147
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,690


148
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,380
obviously then clearly it was not

149
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,600
as simple as changing the value

150
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,960
of the ex because the entire content

151
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,590
of the card was dame on sd card

152
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,750
the next time we inserted

153
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,470
our card

154
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,890
the value of all the cells

155
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,420
was compared with the relative file

156
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,740
which among other things the name of the file is

157
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,800
what comes when you insert unesco at the

158
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,129
bottom of the display and then

159
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:05,219
the contents of the file

160
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,679
contained the ticket was compared and if there was

161
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,989
any  discrepancy sounded

162
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,110
tamper alarm nothing

163
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,899
spectacular and that's pretty much

164
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,699
the only way to secure a

165
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,439
system  such a database in

166
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,050
which based on the serial number

167
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,550
we have the record how many exes that

168
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,729
are upstream and not only on the ticket

169
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,259
actually the exs on the

170
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,568
ticket are only for reference

171
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:35,309
so for the user if he wants to read them

172
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:41,279
on his own  plan b

173
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,078
I had to have a plan b obviously if

174
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:47,130
someone was [ __ ] ruining the

175
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,060
first arduino he was doing some damage

176
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,470
through the serial port of the first

177
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,589
arduino I sent out how many logs

178
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:57,630
all the

179
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,470
transaction logos and attached these these

180
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,569
logos went to another arduino  pro

181
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:06,630
mini via the serial and this

182
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,149
provided to pay and save them on

183
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:10,649
another backup sd card so if

184
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:11,910
someone had been doing it for years on the

185
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,779
main system they had an sd with everyone

186
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,209
they could blog of the transactions

187
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:20,339
could possibly reimburse ines that

188
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,199
paper those who no longer had unesco

189
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:23,819
working if things really went

190
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:29,389
tragically and this of plan b

191
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:32,990
since there was this second a  rduino

192
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,209
piloted a servo motor and an

193
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,959
alarm system the alarm system

194
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,170
was used to

195
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,740
recognize a camper in physical

196
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,529
then our ubi that at night starts

197
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:52,550
with his pickers to try to open

198
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,730
this device what would have happened

199
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,630
this I do it with a key of

200
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,649
course  with his key no I have

201
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:14,600
not engaged him I do not know if

202
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,720
the alarm is now active alarm the lock is

203
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,350
open but at this point he has come to this

204
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,540
point well looked at this object he

205
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,100
would have thought about it for a moment then I would have

206
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,320
rushed towards the fos  lavera tried

207
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,790
to throw inside without thinking

208
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,849
too much it

209
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,399
would have been useless, however, to open it

210
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:45,199
with the ok picking because there was a servo

211
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:47,839
that blocked the opening

212
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,910
regardless unless the correct card was inserted

213
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,589
and therefore I had these three cards

214
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:57,470
in my pocket  one to open one to close

215
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:02,720
and one to reload the ex then the

216
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,810
safety features, in summary, are

217
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,050
security from darkened first of all

218
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,790
double hardware lock and then res  instant

219
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,040
lock picking with a mechanical

220
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,170
padlock and electronic padlock and a human

221
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,400
firewall or

222
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,190
all the baristas were instructed not to

223
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,350
accept any card other than

224
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,400
this essence the stamp art 2 that

225
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,850
this is not there so this here

226
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,940
prevented for example someone who had

227
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,340
a card  fully programmable

228
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,530
or where it should have prevented

229
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,940
someone as a fully

230
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,680
programmable card so even with the

231
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,980
programmable serial to be able to steal

232
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,310
someone else's and use his own his card

233
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:55,280
and weaknesses someone at the dice wants to

234
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,600
try to guess some

235
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,540
weaknesses create new baits from scratch  all

236
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,690
the serials are registered upstream then

237
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,360
the system works in this way

238
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,710
sector v unesco for example there is this

239
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,860
est that this this the mob that

240
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,030
is not programmed inside the

241
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,560
machine

242
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,390
once inserted it says card not

243
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,090
recognized rightly the way  to

244
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,010
accept this card was to first

245
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,160
insert the programming card and

246
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,310
immediately  after insert the i mob and give

247
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,650
credit 10 bait now this here is an esp

248
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,370
all active

249
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,330
exact week point I am therefore

250
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,710
basind cod

251
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,880
because there are

252
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,100
this this that the code for

253
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,540
this I wrote it I finished it on Monday

254
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,070
while he was setting up the camp

255
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,950
physical attacks then take away the box

256
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,990
open the shutters where the alarm does not

257
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,510
bother or anything like that

258
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,680
and the giggles that this is because

259
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,560
there is that for human schipilliti

260
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,490
so getting drunk and stealing my cards clon

261
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,600
weapons le cards was quite difficult

262
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,610
because the  'I have always kept inside

263
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:21,920
a metal container rummaging through

264
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,750
my bag that I often left around

265
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,540
often and willingly around in my

266
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:37,190
tent in my pockets and then

267
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,110
basically unless

268
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,930
I have not lost something and

269
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,730
unless there is  there are very big bugs in the

270
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,530
code the only way to

271
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,170
force this system is social

272
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,770
engineering and indeed there was a bug in the

273
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:59,560
sense that since according to arduino the

274
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,810
first ardui  no sent the payment logs via serial to the

275
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,020
second

276
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,600
arduino when I inserted a card for example

277
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,060
klaus the first and since the motor servo

278
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,650
here they are the alarm are connected with

279
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,420
arduino the first arduino sent according to

280
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,890
the string open underscore dr which was or was

281
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,230
not close dr which  it was written by the

282
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,200
other also on the display and therefore if

283
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,920
one made any card with

284
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,610
an open door message inside the data area

285
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,220
or by underscore dr

286
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,950
this message passed through the

287
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,690
serial and the other 2000 interpreted

288
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,430
as a command  opening and

289
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,030
actually the door opened however

290
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,840
this bug

291
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,540
no no in any memory area of the

292
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,990
card

293
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,980
but I had to remove this bug

294
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,940
because not the serial and the writing

295
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,830
on the sd were not fast enough to

296
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,380
keep up with the dump of the card every

297
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,110
time and  so he had to send much

298
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,080
less data every time and therefore it was no

299
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,110
longer possible to do this also

300
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:24,210
this was not a bug questions yes all

301
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,020
sources saran  no released I don't know where

302
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,510
I think about the abdel crowns lab kit if big

303
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:39,360
shot gives me access not only is it true and I

304
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,720
am competent I agree and that's it if

305
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,470
you want to come and see the contents of

306
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:50,220
the gip gip in your opinion the use

307
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,490
of a  thanks airbag could help in the

308
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,620
suburbs an airbag helped in the

309
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:03,410
active safety of it has nothing to do with it

310
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,420
then I'll give you some information there are

311
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,890
ready cakes

312
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,990
there is no beer there are

313
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,279
very large cakes gone great because soon

314
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,959
smoke cakes as it happened to me
