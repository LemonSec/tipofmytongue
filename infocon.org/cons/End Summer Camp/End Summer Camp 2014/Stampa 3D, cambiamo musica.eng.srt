1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:05,250
only she is fine guys good morning

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,960
i hope if you wake me up

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,880
well enough i'm vittorio

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,259
fasciani acab all then you have already

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,049
seen our 3d printers in the silos

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,260
3d printing theme had to come mixing

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,970
don't talk a little about printing criticize

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,960
what should be printed 3d that  weighs

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,230
strips kills shoes cp and

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,060
so on

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,800
but we say everything that

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,890
those printers do the art lacks a

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,690
particular fridge of subject what

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,579
presents the guys from the east and

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,379
we hear it something different we

16
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,360
present a printer that does

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,530
something innovative that  sounds of

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,909
course if you are turning on now

19
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:49,800
yes I hope you can also hear on

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,210
the other side what this printer is doing

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,210
the mind printing the

22
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,720
bracelet

23
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,449
the tracing often led flash has a

24
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:02,120
fairly simple and repetitive geometric shape

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,220
so what you do to a

26
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,960
kind of  mantra of starvation

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,020
matteo then makes a noise like this

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,510
there are many objects that when

29
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,520
I come  no printers falcon this

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,159
quite repetitive noise for which what

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,740
I apologized max and the

32
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,450
noise dress could modulate it in order to

33
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,220
transform

34
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,960
it what would happen in is more

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,210
like how you could do something

36
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:33,990
like this

37
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,000
let's say that someone already has it  thought

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,830
a 3d printed is nothing more than a

39
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,080
numerical control machine the noise

40
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,380
you hear are the stepper motors

41
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,700
which obviously are over-powered and

42
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,399
create this noise which is nothing more than

43
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,740
the given by the speed in which

44
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,970
the head moves in the asics of the  flat in y axis

45
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,200
obviously you never understand that you can't

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,539
stay if it slowly creates a heavy tumor

47
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:03,360
it went faster it creates a tone

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,420
just ok so looking a bit on the

49
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,729
internet there is a group both in the morning and

50
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,919
if there are some guys from

51
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,710
directly  of the maker

52
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,000
above it took us a while to 50 years to

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,890
build that

54
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,820
amen python system that could take

55
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:32,160
what a source midi file find all

56
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,260
the notes  and divide these notes into

57
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,900
musical frequencies and south in and obviously

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,560
transform the musical frequencies into

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,260
movements to be given to the 3d printer the

60
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,750
so-called cycle is equipped with 7 instructions

61
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,180
that uses 3d slopes you are just a little

62
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,070
shot but I am still slightly drunk

63
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,940
from yesterday evening euro shortage

64
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,440
of sleep that i fine but you too

65
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,000
in short I remind you that you were

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,420
quite awake tonight so that

67
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,980
's okay this which is the mind already

68
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,530
seen all these days so them at

69
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,310
our stand

70
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,970
enough we are fed up enough music

71
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,480
stop the peak plus 6 published by

72
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,929
printer

73
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,170
and  this point

74
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,709
we pass directly the software part

75
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:29,220
ok to do this then we will use

76
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,420
method excuse we

77
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,870
will use a

78
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,940
printer control program directly from the

79
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,810
computer

80
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,940
the graphic interface obviously everything is

81
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,150
open source runs on linux more than anything else

82
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,110
because it supposes python on windows in short it is

83
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,239
a  a bit of a [ __ ] here let's face it

84
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,720
ok

85
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,660
very well I do v  ed very

86
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,629
quickly the program that comes is

87
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:05,450
nothing more than a program written in python

88
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,799
with some libraries

89
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,639
is right because there are geeks

90
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,410
we have ready a program is called you

91
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,199
tell me cnc that is nothing more than the

92
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,400
program that defines practically

93
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,870
decodes what the  midi file

94
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,350
transforms it into program on date 7

95
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,970
g.cozz destructions to be given to the

96
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,660
printer

97
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,090
obviously there is a whole syntax behind

98
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,840
that was created of this

99
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,229
kind

100
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,450
she

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,510
is so

102
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,130
then okay but it is definitely people

103
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,570
on the other side fail  to see,

104
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,540
however, the definition of the

105
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,900
graphic resolution of the projector is not perfect minute,

106
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,280
however, let's say it is launched

107
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,260
mind through python this program

108
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,460
made to cnc dott file it is told the

109
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,140
type of machines that is

110
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,000
used in the command line in this case it is

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,730
a power uasp  otherwise there are about

112
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,680
five types of types of machines

113
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,440
because obviously each machine has

114
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,210
its own peculiarity as far as this is concerned  to be

115
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,280
extruded from plastic and obviously also

116
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,230
piano dimensions

117
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:39,170
we obviously have a command that

118
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,270
defines which midi file we have to

119
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,760
take in this case we had

120
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,390
thought of a music file suitable for doubts and

121
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,390
its situation we say sentimental that

122
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,730
now we will see

123
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,500
we have set what

124
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,540
the out should be  file that obviously has an

125
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,030
extension of .gi cod then

126
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,140
let me use the

127
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,080
classic old Basque van karaoke

128
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,180
because we obviously have the

129
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,480
midi file is nothing more than

130
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,180
a file that uses the various audio channels

131
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,760
to play musical instruments and

132
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,560
maybe not  all musical instruments

133
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,300
played by a 3d printer that

134
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,130
obviously currently two axes can

135
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,300
be good

136
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,790
the technique is that of 8 bit music

137
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,940
present in a four

138
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,910
quarter beating the notes are inserted by

139
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,220
dividing the four quarters for each

140
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,980
note that comes out so both

141
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,470
this  this this similarity with the

142
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,880
music 8 coveted once in this quest  or

143
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,060
case for example taken what because it already

144
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,290
did not work a moment

145
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:58,299
sorry

146
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,820
yes obviously one downloads

147
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,190
any midi file that he finds on the

148
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,530
internet if he has to process it because

149
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,190
obviously it will have a series of

150
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,990
music channels obviously intended as

151
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,730
classical music usually has a one

152
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,710
two or  three maximum music channels for

153
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,320
which quite playable at least

154
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,660
fundable in one channel only two channels

155
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,180
only music let's say rock or other

156
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,740
things perhaps requires greater and more

157
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,500
difficulty as if the only thing

158
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,260
after playing it is

159
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,990
obviously 5 amstrong of a second  does

160
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,930
everything worked perfectly

161
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,270
the beauty of the direct lends

162
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,669
itself remains undefeated in the silence sorry

163
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,300
sorry for the curvature

164
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,080
yes of

165
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,889
course

166
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,690
obviously the tuning of the instrument

167
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,150
on the frequency of the note depends on

168
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,050
everything then of the set that you give it

169
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,759
the speed settings of the

170
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,070
printer that it can reach  in what he

171
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,610
did do

172
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,250
here this one I don't know if I could

173
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,830
hear it is pre 21  she dedicated herself to doubts

174
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:48,590
ok it's a funeral march obviously to

175
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,260
see so there are various channels

176
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,960
usually this the first channel

177
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,840
problems to exclude them see if the

178
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,550
music is still catchy so you

179
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,310
may like it so we can also maybe

180
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,140
work on it

181
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,580
what you can what  at

182
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,340
this point you have to manually count

183
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,650
which are the channels to be inserted and

184
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,470
enter them as channel qua

185
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,360
channel 1 and 2 we only use the

186
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,850
first two channels so at least we break

187
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,000
our balls understood by launching this

188
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,770
program in python what comes

189
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,380
out always stopped because  the

190
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,270
wedding march actually seen a bit like this

191
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,850
on the boxes all you do is create

192
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,320
a queue program that we give the

193
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,740
printer of

194
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,580
course and you need an

195
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,810
intelligent printer understands that the

196
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,520
wedding march is not to be done

197
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:02,930
yes and for which it will do something more

198
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,829
interesting  yes

199
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,760
enough passion

200
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,900
is not exactly wedding march but maybe

201
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,310
someone will recognize the music

202
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,430
this is the music d  the star wars this

203
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,930
that francesca incappati who perhaps

204
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,589
did not recognize her

205
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,769
what you hear previous

206
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:59,649
is the main theme of star wars

207
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:03,019
reproduced by the 3d printer obviously

208
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:05,480
the matter of the

209
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,920
wedding music was a joke

210
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,660
the printer here does nothing but

211
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,750
interpret the  gico di in this sense

212
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,939
obviously has transformed the struggles the

213
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:19,490
movements and said and quickly when

214
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,980
you have to make a high note and go slower

215
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,019
when to make a graham note and is based

216
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,120
on a pattern for definite that famous

217
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,490
with was said in the upper and

218
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,920
lower limits  is of the screen comes

219
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,069
back and in this predefined packard

220
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,750
insert some noise which are the small

221
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:41,120
vibrations that you get by doing

222
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,370
that you get by making the

223
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,399
head move the fars print bed and to

224
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,970
reproduce the sound

225
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,950
this and pressed what as I

226
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,930
said obviously using  this

227
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,460
system we can at this point

228
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,460
create download our midi files

229
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,990
define certain channels  there that we want to

230
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,100
listen to the most significant ones

231
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,290
of a midi file and at this point

232
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,470
we can get various types of music

233
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,400
example

234
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,100
you want to give you want to give greetings to

235
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,199
someone make him do the music wing

236
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:34,889
of the happy birthday

237
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,440
okay

238
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,729


239
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,600
you can know the version quite

240
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:13,880
hello  but this is a classic of

241
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,750
obviously classical music is

242
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,420
much better than then the speech

243
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,759
this classical music obviously

244
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,290
at least instruments for which it is easier

245
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,339
to play

246
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,380
we can also possibly give

247
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,630
a fusion temperature an

248
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,319
extruded command this object to make it do

249
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:33,899
a  3d printing of what obviously

250
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,459
of this pattern and that the printer

251
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:39,449
creates which is given as said by a pattern

252
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:42,120
and predefined in which the

253
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,639
noise of the tigers nature is inserted he we will see the

254
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,680
weight of the thick lines where there are

255
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,730
heavy notes and lines  thin

256
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,259
where there are high-pitched tones because the

257
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:54,899
printer head will pass much faster

258
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:55,709


259
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,170
in this m  I hear what we are able

260
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,889
to do there is a

261
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,480
graphic representation of the music itself

262
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,490
now waiting for the moment it reaches the

263
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,019
temperature the printer could have done

264
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:13,800
it before for example if we launch here

265
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,459


266
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,020
yes no its written by the noises

267
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,730
step by step obviously that noise that

268
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,830
hear when the

269
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,110
3d printer does the printing they are nothing more than

270
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,910
noises that we can modulate at

271
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,750
this point obtaining that the noise is

272
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,089
more serious when it goes slowly

273
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,200
not the same lying on the surface

274
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,820
is given by a predefined pattern to

275
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,410
make it move in some way  the

276
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,330
3d printer more than anything else because perhaps

277
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,010
certain music

278
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,750
would still insist on only one point the flat

279
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,360
surface would bring the head to

280
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,920
reach the end stop from one side

281
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,000
to the other

282
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,680
in this way instead we

283
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,320
still manage to have a control of the

284
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,990
pattern of the area of  printing of the

285
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,180
printer and being able to insert what is

286
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,209
the noise

287
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:09,179
that obviously if we call it noise but

288
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:13,369
in this  case it becomes in the sound understood

289
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:17,149
let's be careful ture

290
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:26,389
they have removed my permission

291
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,320
yes reprap then there is the makerbot hiding

292
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,000
last ker

293
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,880
the wasp now but I hate to say that in

294
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,910
any case it is anyway both then there

295
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,710
are settings that if personally that

296
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:03,000
are 66 the  you say what the 0 and 6 max

297
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,420
is what is the upper limit on

298
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,590
the other side and you really get the whole

299
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,250
print plane yes

300
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,010
the circular inter-plane head

301
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,270
there we haven't worked on it yet what

302
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,520
you now hear is present the minute

303
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,240
of mouthpieces

304
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,040
I hope that  feel a little everyone

305
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:56,010
wanted almost now to printer

306
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,159
to me when plastic on

307
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,250
what we are doing the

308
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,030
greeting

309
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,510
are partners

310
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,970
which way

311
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,980


312
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,320
we show

313
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,830
but it is obviously not excluding

314
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,149
the printer in the evening

315
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,990
nothing more

316
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,029
with this let's say enough and unique

317
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:09,030
logic that is  in the sense that frey the

318
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,080
one on the foot out

319
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
tied to the music

320
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,370
the printer so what we

321
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,520
have

322
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:25,340
24 would be this painting is the

323
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,110
representation  and graphics of the minuet of

324
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,330
mouthpieces as the printer sees it

325
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,060
you see that it takes if you

326
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,710
notice there is the default pattern that

327
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,320
brings the fine head better however

328
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,240
its way it carries from right to left

329
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,160
from an upper limit to the

330
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,010
lower limit and then returns  back

331
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,770
obviously what it then does is

332
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,780
create some noise here it seems as if I had

333
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,770
printed badly but it is only vibrations

334
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,150
created by the movement

335
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,810
the head in playing the music itself

336
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,060
so it is something a

337
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,100
unique graphic representation of the

338
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,040
music

339
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,420
that we have the  minuet of

340
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,890
mouthpieces printed I would have had

341
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,370
another object

342
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,690
this someone else for

343
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,830
cult lovers instead the present

344
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,440
imperial march of star wars

345
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,510
here is obviously always interpreted

346
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,850
by the printer of the power one in a

347
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,440
certain way in short you think I know

348
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,540
a room more printer than  this

349
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,160
genre that each plays a

350
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,530
musical instrument synchronized with each other

351
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,300
can create  re an

352
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,160
art installation and then maybe someone can

353
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,690
even say yes having a crazy

354
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,260
[ __ ] is crazy [ __ ] but maybe that

355
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,490
fact of having made a

356
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,780
3d printer sound already in itself and I sing in

357
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,639
disgust or if you like

358
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,929
the importance yes  and I remind you that

359
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:02,279
more or less

360
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,799
fifty people have really worked for which about

361
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,380
fifty excellent minds in mine

362
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,390
obviously worked to

363
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,640
create this little program so that

364
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,049
obviously I walk around on all the

365
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,950
cnc machines on all the machines let's say

366
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,440
noisy cables transforming them  in that

367
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,059
subject just to say it I had

368
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,309
created it because my girlfriend hearing the

369
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:26,490
black music print let's say how cute

370
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,809
how beautiful we are would be our

371
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,690
music printed with the 3d printer

372
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,460
so I created nickelbacks far away

373
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,360
directly with 3d printing

374
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,130
what happened and then her husband

375
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,860
who sucks but gave up so if you have

376
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,750
girls do not show them these things

377
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,179
because there is a little price

378
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,179
ok more or less this is the talk i'm

379
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:51,029
even look in time

380
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:54,149
sorry the plushy tongue would tell me

381
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:57,080
fantozzi but really just crack very

382
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,419
ok so much to repeat the same things

383
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:05,360
also intends to tell me

384
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,000
in theory drought that is wait from these

385
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,930
tracks here you say

386
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,710
in theory yes that is  you should be there to

387
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,320
see the deformation as that

388
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,440
starting from a record in microgroove and

389
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,630
arriving at the music transform them neither d

390
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:42,220
hiver dub is the leader in this case 5

391
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:45,169
no wait wait in this case he

392
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:47,059
lacks the time because he still lacks

393
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:49,100
it he cannot understand  what is the speed

394
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,159
of displacement maybe in certain

395
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,450
directions so it's a bit difficult

396
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,759
while maybe the microgroove record instead I

397
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,789
sign in 45 rpm and then go read

398
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:00,830
the various roughnesses and maybe you can

399
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,789
come back to this maybe yes that I

400
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,950
'm a bit in some alien technology

401
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,080
it seems to me that they already do it is that from

402
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:15,980
da facen tauri yes but I hate let's say

403
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,279
removing the parameter does trying to

404
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,700
make sure that the knurling is

405
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,679
pe  rpendicular to the pattern then if

406
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:32,509
we can reconstruct exactly what you are

407
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:34,779


408
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:39,309
certain site

409
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,330
and at that point it is elia and modular in that

410
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,830
case we would have a fixed pattern so

411
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,260
we already have a constant from them to be able to

412
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,690
extract what information

413
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,190
so it would be a good example of

414
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,730
steganography hello you  gift this

415
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,800
small picture then maybe it contains those

416
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,390
born to build a nuclear power plant

417
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,230
in iraq

418
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,140
in short, maybe we have some

419
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,940
computer forensics who could be

420
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,740
interested in a house tomorrow today

421
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,710
we are not at all cautious so other

422
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,930
questions or in any case oh well so much we

423
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,140
will see each other there too we will make some other

424
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,120
music at  true that anyway the

425
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,100
music you really want a sequel a rocket

426
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,650
with excuse me the term that is a fact

427
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,800
star wars people go to google and

428
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:36,440
you have not even moved dddd indeed white is

429
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,190
true that the true

430
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:45,879
yes yes yes yes yes

431
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:54,370
maybe we could possibly do a

432
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,508
some music says

433
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:04,450
maybe wait

434
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,260
no this is the trees now for

435
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,970
mario you know some  n doctors have

436
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,130
problems to be decoded at least

437
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,960
you have to cut them out like for example

438
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,480
monkeys island but given a really

439
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,400
hard time

440
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,840
here I make him feel right for

441
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,309
francesco grabbed because he is monti

442
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:36,809
sen

443
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,840
that is for himself drool here we wanted him

444
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,009
as bait music

445
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:49,950
who  is that we know even if it is far away

446
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,230
and monkey island

447
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,680
ok

448
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,240
there is really all the inter or the b

449
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,730
is more iniqui de filippi ok

450
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,480
you have this is a program that you need

451
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,580
to be able to connect it could was printer

452
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,920
do this thing to remove the seats

453
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,930
put it is  the game of wrong and

454
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,200
incorrect

455
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:27,360
but here are three channels

456
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,150
yes because obviously you use

457
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,070
8 bit music with that while trying to merge

458
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,160
more channels into one channel by dividing into

459
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,900
four parts and guards or three

460
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,600
ah if it would have been better kept if

461
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,220
sometimes there  it is really some problem

462
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,110
because in any case the movements so

463
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,330
fast that those that are

464
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,299
specific to the printer are worth it are free there are

465
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:58,309
almost four months who  ne production

466
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:01,928
that maybe does not recognize in this sense

467
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:08,480
wait what happened here we are

468
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,750
late really we want with this here

469
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,789
is enough here is some music from the

470
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:21,200
30s it is fine with this music couple I leave you it

471
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,570


472
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:27,450
is right the link to the software just

473
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,450
search  mi di tucci lc with the 2

474
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:33,680
you find all the information

475
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:39,030
