1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,380
mister it would be a day owes many in

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,839
this fantastic talk in which we will talk about the

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,040
besieged what is the axis dr

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,340
the acronym is a sort of prize

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,520
in essence it is a radio made via

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,470
software it is still a 7 I do not leave in

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,869
these years it is born many years  plum ago

8
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,550
how many years ago there was a problem that

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,590
computers do not have so fast to do

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,649
processing so what becomes

11
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,670
possible nowadays

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,590
therefore the strategy

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,480
and implementation of you what is

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,210
a radio or a part of  it is yes of course

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,680
you see chain bed that vector

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,390
arrived immediately he nothing nothing nothing

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,820
but it was right then what is it that

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,370
is redefined can be defined as a

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,589
part some radios and moderns that we

20
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,290
buy now have a part a

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,960
part his reason farm software that

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,270
the final part then in the

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,060
final part in the race a diego in the championship the

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,250
audio signal is in quotes

25
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,409
made that people in of spe then

26
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,390
filtered the signal the other attention

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,140
that the one ch  and is seeing today will be valid

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,630
in the future also for mobile phones for which it

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,570
is possible to redefine the functioning

30
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,030
of the mobile phone by modifying certainly more

31
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,720
by changing the mobile phone so what we

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,550
see now are

33
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,940
in experimental quotation marks that when they

34
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,490
concern radio amateurs even if

35
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,090
reality already exists finished projects so

36
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,340
there is something defined so we are

37
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,990
already using this technology

38
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,290
the military part is already using it for

39
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,620
some things and a lot of the future element knows

40
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,870
that the mobile phones will be made via

41
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,330
software and not the hardware there will still be a

42
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,580
display but the modification of the

43
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,420
protocols turns over updated redemption

44
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,150
the  cell phone or generating having to

45
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,680
update automatically

46
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,870
an algorithm in the protocol will be presented in a function

47
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:32,560
now we see what

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,150
advantages it brings beyond what I

49
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,780
just said

50
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:41,830
the cdr is possible as if before a

51
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,300
gerlinde shirt and the

52
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,120
functionally halabja change on the radios is that

53
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,260
I have to go to modify  to weld to

54
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,790
modify as wk  hours to change

55
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,680
something here is done exclusively

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,350
by software so in quotes at no

57
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,900
cost apart from the poor engine

58
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,470


59
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,620
well, you also save your fingers because it is a

60
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,130
sign wasting snow you burn your

61
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,370
fingers and cheap in the sense that apart from

62
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,380
the blur the initial commitment  because

63
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,690
the single or escape came and the

64
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,510
lady is very simple to do in the

65
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,550
sense that it will skip a fat

66
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,330
implementation cost but then this couple is

67
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:30,100
practically zero especially if for example

68
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,020
an open source project this is a

69
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,120
project that is born

70
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,250
open source for which  both hardware and

71
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,010
software are freely downloadable

72
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,510
modifiable the performance this action

73
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,489
can none compare to that

74
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:48,819
of the hardware because the 7 is something

75
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:52,390
beautiful that many legends born passive and

76
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,870
active however within a diode there is

77
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,120
assistance 10 nascent

78
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,519
telephoto lenses are counted  the same their but certain

79
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,739
tolerance a renato naval operations room will

80
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:06,489
share in value to me in

81
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:08,200
the re  adher and the mood is a whole series

82
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,170
of problems that the software I had

83
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,420
read to you not for which six local holes in

84
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,280
quotation marks in the instance ten years is an

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,630
essence of cia on all the chapters

86
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:25,090
this world as I said before of

87
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,860
telepiù militant which we do not  they are

88
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,560
problems of tolerance aging

89
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,130
component does not age so there is one

90
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,840
who has carried a needle for twenty years who

91
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,110
was still in health may have

92
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,020
likely connected tending to lose it

93
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,340
fortunately working first shot

94
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,200
many returns are that

95
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,150
the radio is always on but do  the foreign one

96
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:55,599
works as if before having

97
00:04:55,599 --> 00:05:00,639
and updating by updating the fate of the

98
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,389
stay on the radio the radio becomes less

99
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:06,699
of an insole over time therefore they have a

100
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:10,030
longer duration with how the document is a

101
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,630
greater value we have to remove

102
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,919
architecture to besiege the technique

103
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,440
while the idea is  that of having a

104
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,260
reception an analog

105
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,550
digital conversion an elaboration that beautiful one

106
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,890
of which it is said of the signal that not  n

107
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,670
we receive and go to listen to what

108
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,580
I love so we are interested in processing with

109
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,140
the transformation of furies all the

110
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:48,070
functions that serve the radio part

111
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,880
what I was going to see there are various

112
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,890
possibilities these for example one of the

113
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,380
most used for many commercial radios

114
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,810
for which  were the front end and

115
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,440
antenna reception a first conversion or the

116
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,340
various filter declare of furniture with

117
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,880
which all the various invites any

118
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,140
very expensive that in reality do not have

119
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,830
that value I will dedicate now from magic to

120
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,630
digital the conversion not done with

121
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,000
very low frequency and  automatically

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,410
the processing done almost the

123
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,270
software part done only in the final part

124
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,630
of the radio the beginning in the

125
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,730
intermediate part what is the frequency for the

126
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:38,830
medium remains analog the second part

127
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,590
and let me know prepared the kx

128
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,990
tran I did so it

129
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,110
will be a first direct connection  and

130
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,850
there came the manure commitment in the

131
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,190
possible but as a lady gb and visible to

132
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,060
him f 16

133
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,450
action and here the anger  for honey for

134
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,870
today people the first conversion what is

135
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,180
the problem is telematics is

136
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,980
liking in the part of the

137
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,410
analog to digital converter that the part in

138
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,480
quotation marks more expensive because the higher

139
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,970
frequency that a

140
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:21,490
frugoletto sampling operated on it where it

141
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,040
would like a single tree in the double sampling

142
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,590
receive up to 30 but linked

143
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,960
to sampling less than 60 megs that was

144
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,580
the only digital technological green

145
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,960
position at 60 megs

146
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,550
then with the digital logics turin covers

147
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,020
present this has a direction of

148
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,229
125 never to 220 nicolò succeeded 225 two

149
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:49,960
strings or 125 thousand  approximately

150
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,550
before two even because it has two

151
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,310
entrances with two cemeteries with

152
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,560
contemporaries and therefore manages to

153
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,310
sample sight data up to 60 beggars

154
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,880
without shifts in fact this goes from 0 to 60

155
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,330
mario even if from tarragona turin up

156
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,568
to 52 perceptions reaches up to about 57

157
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:15,700
they

158
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,900
are not so therefore kx tra for example to

159
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,800
this functioning of which

160
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,960
the converted signal is taken immediately a signal  ale

161
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,870
much lower then in trance at 20

162
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,480
malaga must be brought to a rethinking

163
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,549
of barcelona following a task and

164
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,570
oenological digital that fair works

165
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,350
this the signal not pen enters

166
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,169
directly on with digital analog hortifair

167
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,990
so the signal is immediately

168
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,090
digitized to English l  'antenna

169
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,730
therefore not even more visualized

170
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,160
let's say the low frequency the medium

171
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,780
frequency but

172
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,870
the high frequencies are drawn directly this

173
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,180
dell udc digitizes from 0 to 60 maya

174
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,670
as in Verona the whole band all the

175
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,220
other so it is a reception at the same time

176
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,310
wool from zero would never have

177
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,280
apologized  60 never to the advantage of this is

178
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,290
that I can have many

179
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,360
Apulia receivers I can say I want to hear only

180
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,550
a slice of each band that interests me

181
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,400
this league wants to have 14

182
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,070
contemporary receivers matter of greatest

183
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,230
defect from the point of view of the

184
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,390
working part because 14 final receivers

185
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,770
they are war a pc that is able to

186
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,200
manage them say 14 because the processing

187
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,000
done  on the pc side therefore this is from a

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,220
point of view the best things that

189
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,230
we can keep well defined residual

190
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,070
of the fourth generation so the conversion

191
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,290
from analog to digital is done

192
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,930
at input 21 as you see here

193
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,040
because always

194
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,800
a navigator an adapter to help these

195
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,759
short months  analog digital the same

196
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,130
thing they had done also in transmission

197
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,529
in transmission my voice is

198
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:14,720
synthesized not cut to the dsp is

199
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,069
automatically created bank the protections digital

200
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:22,009
analog directly base frequency of

201
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:24,620
which the frequency is generated also

202
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:30,980
that digital mode and makes the

203
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,370
direction with different  from digital it is

204
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,740
converted to analogue and being that

205
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,910
frequency this anger is present a

206
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,680
feature has had new

207
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,040
class ii stimuli fi cators that you see on the fairs

208
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,779
where the dates consumed indexes la vida

209
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:57,319
15 8 14,8 therefore in the vicinity close to

210
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:00,319
100 percent the same  what can be done

211
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:02,389
here at the moment

212
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:04,850
current elect instruments are doing  However, this

213
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,240
is already able to receive

214
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,610
a part of the signal transmitted back

215
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,730
to the receiver to see where there are

216
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,190
distortions and go to destroy in

217
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,350
the opposite way to correct the

218
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,149
distortion reports a much

219
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:23,240
cleaner signal these if the first three

220
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,100
villas experiments for  anpas

221
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,319
practically deceives the sail output signals,

222
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,480
however, received by the xvi apparatus

223
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,579
to thematically correct any

224
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:35,269
distortions and to lower the

225
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:40,519
components that are generated

226
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:47,389
large transmissions what you see here is

227
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:49,850
a commercial version so there will be

228
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,259
a company that has marketed

229
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:54,769
guyton sense in the project  that arises bhps of

230
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:59,949
areas that high performance sdr that this

231
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:02,420
not as I see him not seen before

232
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,920
completely directed to a change

233
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,750
16 bit tibet there is more the dynamics

234
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:13,250
of the receiver is better and from my

235
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,310
point of view

236
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,470
I do contest so I compete the

237
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,820
greater problem than when

238
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,839
competing and that in many signals

239
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,490
from my point of view it has improved and the

240
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,079
one that the best receiver because

241
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,019
transmitter more or less

242
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,360
all work more or less came, however, is

243
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,399
something that has not heard less because

244
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,290
transmitter easy to do

245
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,990
tends to be inserted rather

246
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,220
more difficult to do

247
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,980
species  with very powerful signals very

248
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,190
close the bears of the difference between a

249
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,829
100 euro radio and a thousand

250
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:54,769
euro radio not so much from a monetary point of view

251
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:56,450
in the sense that there are this

252
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,640
costs much less than 10 thousand euro radio

253
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,269
by much better than 10 thousand side  euro

254
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:05,870
7,000 euro because advantage for example

255
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,730
years yes we do the example of the

256
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,470
aquar filter stops almost ideal

257
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,660
square must signal that it concerns from

258
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,930
that center is zero that is an inside the

259
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,140
filter is not attenuated instead ideally

260
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,339
filters quartz it is not perfectly wrong

261
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:30,220
down perfectly but it is not linear

262
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,839
first of all it is however not perfect

263
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,519
so that at a certain distance, however

264
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:37,940
, something passes which n

265
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,120
this is not square because it is a paid fact

266
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,220
so that if a signal is inside the

267
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,959
exception part you hear it outside

268
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,329
the participation you do not hear it

269
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:49,100
another dynamic because on the percent

270
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,019
of dynamic cdp you count that the

271
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:54,470
normal major radios that did not like rai1

272
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,620
80 90 of dynamics if I do not want to go to the

273
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,930
radio that built exceeds 5,000 euros

274
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:05,329
hear something that above 100 db to 7

275
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:07,300
receivers I sing songs for each of

276
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,690
analog digital converter

277
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,730
question to two so technically there are

278
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,399
14 parents at the same time the output

279
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,800
if card  network

280
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,180
let's say it could be

281
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,920
advantageous

282
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,930
soon I can have a radio

283
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,380
only sky first are the multi

284
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,660
operator races single radio I can have

285
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,670
five people

286
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,610
who have 75 receivers at the same time

287
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,970
each on a pc this the

288
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,340
data transmission which or via the internet so that's enough

289
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,690
that everyone attacking his receiver on the net

290
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,760
and

291
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,290
transmitting only one at a time

292
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,720
because for the regulation  it allows

293
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,420
only one and therefore or with an only apparatus

294
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,100
the acous have been quality decisions

295
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,330
sorry if to the quality receivers and the

296
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,020
transmission with a single has parried it is

297
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,340
almost impossible at this moment and to

298
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,180
any commercial apparatus

299
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,670
what you see here which is the  'last

300
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,710
point is the commercial version so

301
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,040
I was saying that the board actually comes out with

302
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,080
500,000 watts there was a company

303
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,430
that built an amplifier to

304
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,460
bring it to 100 watts and built the he

305
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,400
asked for the box and put into

306
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:26,800
production that  this is the scheme

307
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,490
this is what we see here unfortunately we do not

308
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,370
see the signal is converted from the two

309
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,000
analog to digital and a fpc to brufa

310
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,090
work dirtier the bbc aviano period

311
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,070
and loved according to new ones that are

312
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,630
inserted and the signal is fired

313
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,490
internet for which a  is such that having

314
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,980
requested I want to listen to 14 mag a and

315
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,130
he shoots me out 14 384 the kilohertz

316
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,890
of bandwidth of that slice of

317
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,960
frequency that interests me to hear

318
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,040
and a  I listen,

319
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,570
however, I see it all are also

320
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,850
serious technically working from 0 to 60

321
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,800
megs at the same time all the band in

322
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,660
transmission to the contrary success for

323
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,360
which the signal is converted from

324
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,130
digital to ring

325
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,430
it succeeds 500 thousand watts when

326
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,080
a card arrives that the  amplifier that the

327
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,330
door ventilated for one hundred milk so

328
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,210
an obligation is the one who live it between

329
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,920
30 and 100 side continuously

330
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,250
the other interesting thing is that the

331
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,090
connections between the front point of view

332
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,560
are very few compared to the radio it makes

333
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,150
sense that they are had a  radio the demos I

334
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,120
notice the lights actually after for those

335
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,560
interested what would roll out

336
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,260
motors of the grates to the chair the radio

337
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,570
that the radio is seen on the merits of the

338
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:54,180
PCs because I do not really like the mouse is the

339
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,430
same in quotation marks use the knob

340
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,790
to turn for  listen there is a

341
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,660
mentally ill person who elisa at home who has

342
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,069
taken you have seen the dj consoles well he has

343
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,050
taken those and inserted it in the

344
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,699
software because if the crisis  it was

345
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,400
modified for which the dj console depends

346
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,770
and turning it bonotto largo to the left

347
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,410
visual endorsement and turning the display and the

348
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,449
buttons go to modify as if

349
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:24,939
they were there where it was in use at random and I can

350
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,410
say that it works very well so

351
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,300
armani second monitor which is  the radio

352
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,310
below is the console for which or by turning

353
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,140
the console and how to use a lake to the

354
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,200
point of view in which even the exact

355
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,960
advantage is that since many will like it

356
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,820
but not for a large and larger

357
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,500
dj console there is no  'it is nothing like

358
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,480
knob because gigantic to beautiful to

359
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,380
get around this is the ticket

360
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,810
awaits alarm dark st

361
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,390
in essence these lf lie which is the

362
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,120
most expensive part together with the

363
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,800
analog digital converter that is

364
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,450
here in the middle that now I do not see a

365
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,060
clear to this in essence it is

366
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,760
received there is

367
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,270
analog to digital converter filter and it becomes the radio

368
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,780
this was this here this is this

369
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,760
that has a single defendant in the constant

370
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,660
$ 1,800

371
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,310
you have a radio that if you take  the kamut

372
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,910
9 90 which costs 7 thousand euros has no

373
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,680
comparison in the sense that comparing

374
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,260
the smell of reception I always speak there

375
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,020
is no comparison between this radio and

376
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,480
this one with 800 after you have 500 euros the

377
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,030
web where the voice elementary the power

378
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,390
said before dynamics the advantage is

379
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,310
hot direct sampling in high dynamics

380
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,840


381
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,030
there is no intention of rigor

382
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,010
having nothing in the front end and therefore

383
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,840
there are no more amplifiers there are

384
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,360
no mixers there are no

385
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,570
introduction every analog electronic component

386
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,350
that inserted introduces the mood

387
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,570
this eliminates the noise part in

388
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,520
fact as noise levels the

389
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,590
lowest among the lowest

390
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,960
I speak of this but in reality it is true for

391
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,450
all the sdrs to direct sampling

392
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,900
on all the same more or less they do not have a

393
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,650
noise of  introduced by the radio because he

394
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,020
listens to the café of caesare 18 mo spherical

395
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,390
there is already noise that of all the

396
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,830
equipment especially those who live in the city

397
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,140
like mestre who turn a mess of

398
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,360
noise if they have  we also introduce noise to us

399
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,620
because not a series of

400
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,760
components

401
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,030
we go to species because it makes a contest of

402
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,670
48 hours the hours that jump away instead

403
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,110
so

404
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,750
if one is used to this and goes on a

405
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,190
normal type radio

406
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,650
the first thing you notice is the aldo  noise that

407
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,000


408
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,100
I hear in the background of normal radio wool and after two

409
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,540
minutes it bothers me because I am

410
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,000
used to this unfortunately I was

411
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,130
born I have recently resumed again

412
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,410
accusing me of this so I have a

413
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,370
hard time coming back

414
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,980
and like when you have the first

415
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,140
color television and c  'they were some

416
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,640
who came in color I don't give a

417
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,840
damn to give back a week

418
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,770
color television

419
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,049
ah no you could see he went back to those

420
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:20,850
black block is not immediately that colors

421
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,830
because the snow sucks because he was

422
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,590
used to it is not so much when you pass and

423
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,330
when it comes back, however, there is a lot

424
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,080
of difference

425
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,240
the door price / performance ratio is

426
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:41,600
very high questions

427
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,000
there is one after from 11 pm 2

428
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,529
exact indeed none of the  n

429
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:02,549
contemporary between today and tomorrow but

430
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:08,409
as a contest there are 3 1 and tomorrow

431
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:09,690
morning

432
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,279
we tomorrow morning

433
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:14,500
1 starts in all the other two start

434
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,250
at two that there is a uf ronnie has

435
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,100
therefore the other is spoken instead in the

436
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,960
Greek income  that is, the old woman

437
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,799
writes interio radio technically you

438
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,600
have to make as many connections as possible in

439
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,260
this case it is Romanian so you have to make as

440
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,820
many connections as possible if you connect by

441
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,230
now you do not make more points connect the

442
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,600
others stop points and make as many

443
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,130
connections as possible on as many frequencies as

444
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,750
possible the same person  then he can

445
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,659
connect on multiple frequencies on multiple bands

446
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:45,669
indeed he always talks about accuracy because the

447
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:49,960
donors have multiple bands and the

448
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,240
total sum of the connections multiplied

449
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,830
multipliers which can be

450
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,010
anything from the final score sum

451
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,500
winner there are mentally ill people who

452
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,299
do to give you the  idea 48 48 hours at

453
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:06,130
the multimeter stations make 6 thousand

454
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,169
connections 6,600 connections

455
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:11,049
means two three hundred connections now you

456
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:12,010
direct  and well in short

457
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,909
try to stay radiate and make a

458
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:19,270
connection technically make one

459
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,399
connection per minute is already as much it

460
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:23,710
means 60 their connections as to make

461
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,659
180 means that nominator of wanting

462
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:27,340
many people voltage that there is an

463
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,429
exchange of data to confirm therefore

464
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:32,320
there  it is a number that is passed is a

465
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,510
so there is always a parameter that is

466
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,100
passed that must be written

467
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,169
to the log file then they have made the intersection and the

468
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:39,909
final result comes

469
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:42,370
out the errors are removed percentage of errors

470
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:42,789
etc.

471
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:46,419
then we say that then yes  that then you

472
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:48,580
can do an hour of contest of the 48 we

473
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,440
do not care it is not that I am obliged to

474
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,070
do 48 for what you want you participate

475
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,510
to make connection to the

476
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,600
station usually there are some counts are

477
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,480
international and very felt where

478
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,550
practically everything  the world competes

479
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,030
on those you can do the

480
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,830
strange station that never did consul

481
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,020
australia yesterday here we arrived

482
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,330
new zealand afternoon comes the new

483
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,070
z  elanda Australia that technically

484
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,530
we are talking about connections 12,000

485
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:22,120
kilometers from here 18,000 km so that

486
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,730
does not often happen in contests as a gift

487
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,810
listen if how they did the

488
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,300
connections are less deaf than when

489
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,280
instead of making a normal connection

490
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,690
where maybe I hear the station

491
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,700
small but in any case there is a stronger one they

492
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,290
tend to give precedence to the strong one

493
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,600
because so much instead if Italy I have

494
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,160
never connected and if a multiplier

495
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,110
even if they just hear you just

496
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,700
do everything to listen to you so it is

497
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:48,940
easier out connections it amuses me

498
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,890
I like it because it still interests those who

499
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,600
want a demonstration to see how

500
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,270
sdrs works a provision for which

501
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,100
you can see bandwidth playing

502
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,920
on these things here are available

503
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:08,910
on the pil you see are questions

504
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,560
no he did not bring the dj console

505
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,680
because too much stuff  i'm to bring back

506
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,250
however the console

507
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:22,210
dj arcolesse dj is something like this

508
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,350
how cool to play

509
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,300
yes

510
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,610
yes no

511
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,049
no beware  ne that now at this

512
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:46,760
moment to not do multiple reception

513
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,309
there are many but you have

514
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:51,860
it same server you cannot connect

515
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,110
from multiple machines they are implementing a

516
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,850
server where everything on tableware and each

517
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,450
then takes its receiver this here

518
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,280
to two analog converters  digital on

519
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,960
two different antennas so technically

520
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,880
if you put the two specially filtered antennas

521
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,559
you can transmit and

522
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,780
receive at the same time in the contest the

523
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,429
reception and at the same time when the

524
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:12,770
five receivers when one transmits

525
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,510
the others continue to receive anyway

526
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,330
because not looking otherwise it would

527
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,290
be exact Iranian anyway  they listen to

528
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:24,559
other questions as in the future it will be so

529
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,049
one can put an apparatus

530
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:30,049
technically connected to the network even from home in

531
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:31,790
doing the accounts from home that apparatus that

532
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,480
is somewhere else

533
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,179
that I do not like very much because it serves

534
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:43,280
many many it is nice to have everyone no  yes

535
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,590
the antenna the antenna the apparatus of its

536
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,169
own place not the people

537
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:50,120
you are in good standing are  o the antennas that must

538
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,799
be the apparatus the antenna must be

539
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,690
physically connected within a radius of

540
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,640
500 meters which then vary for some and

541
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,429
not 200 but 500 other thousand words

542
00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:00,200
building actually connected is as

543
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,640
if after a long time only the

544
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,179
microphone and the pedal  ptt and the headset

545
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:07,130
that to have it even at 300

546
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,809
kilometers away does not change there are as much as

547
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:09,770
they had them so that they have the

548
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,500
station up the beautiful mountain and

549
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,210
indeed there is one that has pretended the station

550
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,030
you can pay and from home you tusi  the station and

551
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:24,130
pay by the hour other questions

552
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,130
thanks
