1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,250
ok this talk is divided into two parts

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,850
in the first we talk about di screzi in the

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,349
second we talk about cover dosio the

4
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:12,360
then in the meantime what scratch wrote

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,910
a

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,789
didactic and visual programming language that is it was a

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,590
programming language problem

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,170
that was created specifically for

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,510
children  they learn learn to

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,449
program children aged 5 6 and up was born

11
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,590
in the early 2000s in 2003 and was

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,410
born to her mighty practically is the

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,530
grandson of the logo if anyone has ever

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,660
seen halfway through yesterday what logo language is

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,050
in the eighties it is actually from

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,329
the sixties and logo language anyway

17
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,629
then we understand why the this man you

18
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,360
see here is a professor of the mit and is the

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,699
creator of the scratch language is a

20
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,579
professor at the mit and also behind the

21
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:04,409
attach mindstorm that is to those projects

22
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,229
related to construction  then motorized

23
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,350
controlled by the computer I know if

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,330
you know the various evolutions of the thurman corn

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,240


26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,890
this is the scratch logo and this is

27
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,110
the cat below  which represents scratch and

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,189
which is present in as soon as you open the

29
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,830
jokes program you find it the

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,650
current version of scratch is the 2nd point something

31
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,290
runs on any operating system that is

32
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,560
linux mac windows and runs both offline and

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,560
online and via browser and relies on

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,850
adobe air

35
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,680
while  the first version was

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,090
something else so you can

37
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,619
the official version would be the one that

38
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,090
runs via browser

39
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,820
and then there is anyway the offline one which is

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,770
practically complete runs quite

41
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,170
well even on old computers as far as

42
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,880
we could try that is it wanders

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,460
dobler runs  it also runs scratch and

44
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,990
we have tried it on schools that

45
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,450
usually have very old computers

46
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,729
so scratch and also an

47
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,130
online community in the sense that you just have to register

48
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,818
freely and you can take the

49
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,038
programs the applications made by others

50
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:11,760
you can

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,650
modify that mission remix yes  can

52
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,659
study codes and discrete is a

53
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,640
programming language that

54
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,760
we can define social then right

55
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,620
for the  framing from the historical point of view

56
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,500
how all this was born if

57
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,799
you have ever read akers book by steven

58
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:31,739
levy and explains to him that the

59
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,900
computer culture was born to her mighty and

60
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,569
the beginning of the years about in the 50s

61
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,819
to then become practically

62
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,209
commercially very profitable with

63
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,849
Apple branded products in general with the

64
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,980
first ones or a computer

65
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,680
here in Italy we got there a little

66
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,299
after we always get there a little

67
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:51,690
later

68
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,549
for most of us at least

69
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,099
who are about 40 years old the introduction

70
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,950
of computer science came with the

71
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,290
commodore 64 mass graves commodore vic

72
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,870
20 first with the first broadcasts of

73
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,190
piero angela

74
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:11,040
in the rai and for us at least for

75
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,940
those of my age

76
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,739
the programming was something

77
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,900
that we started as self-taught

78
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,139
but in reality it is something that

79
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:21,269
could also be taught  or that you

80
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,940
should be teaching and currently if

81
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,609
you have heard the renewal of

82
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:28,049
the school curricula which

83
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,060
was actually supposed to be announced yesterday but it is

84
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,489
not  n started there was talk of doing a

85
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:33,959
number of core ding in

86
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,430
compulsory school since the beginning of this year

87
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,690
as has already been the case in England and

88
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,120
for many years in several other

89
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,319
countries

90
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,370
here one wonders then what is the

91
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,500
best language to

92
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,160
teach  computer science to children in 2014 is

93
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,139
still a subject computer science

94
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:54,690
programming that is suitable

95
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,590
for self-taught then the

96
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,329
first to ask these things but

97
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:02,250
not before we know it was

98
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,199
professor papert who was a mathematician

99
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,930
a computer scientist a pedagogist who  at mit

100
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,290
in the 60s he invented the logo

101
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,449
for a while he also worked in europe

102
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:15,840
with a liking that he is a famous pedagogist

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,589
who was this very well known

104
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,599
by the teachers also Italian then

105
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,020
completely us as informed with him

106
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,240
been inside some ideas and then  he

107
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,650
used with the logo then as we are

108
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,960
also hulk who is a Swiss computer scientist

109
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,090
that the author the creator of the

110
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,770
pascal language which is a language created for the purpose of

111
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,449
teaching  penthouses that was taught in

112
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,830
our technical institutes especially

113
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,378
in the 80s and 90s

114
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,970
then the pascal contrary to the basic

115
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,379
or at least to the basic that we

116
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:54,319
learned an al colon state 4 was a

117
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,960
language that gave a setting that is

118
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,000
in the sense that one had to reflect on the

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,740
problem half with  basic is

120
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,530
practically we began to write and then there were

121
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,039
the group that was let's say a

122
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,259
command that the pascale was inserted

123
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:11,289
many years later and also with

124
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,669
much reflection on the pascale

125
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:15,469
arpac a language so that you could

126
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:17,569
learn computer science and

127
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:19,430
computer programming in a

128
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,680
let's say so having a clear method

129
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,150
pascal is one of the

130
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,639
scratch explorers because we have the blocks cycles

131
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,349
blocks of commands the declaration

132
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:33,650
of the variables he made up separately

133
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,840
but actually there and therefore many

134
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,639
scratch characteristics agree

135
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,319
remember  very closely the

136
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,370
pascal language the sprite sprites characters

137
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,380
are moved through commands the

138
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,750
movement that are both in English and

139
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,779
Italian takes ten steps rotates and 50

140
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:52,580
degrees fi another ten steps I go

141
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,900
back and so on

142
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,279
practically all this was

143
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,360
taken from the logo language that

144
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,550
could be used in computers a computer

145
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,710
in the 80s or even  before

146
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,050
and for the lucky ones it could

147
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,509
also be used with the real turtle

148
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:10,520
that is to

149
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,400
have a small robot draw circles lines that was connected

150
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,360
I think as rs232 at the time and this is the

151
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,650
screen of the geometry of the

152
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,620
turtle that some even

153
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,080
Italian teachers have taught  in

154
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,539
elementary and middle schools in the 80s and

155
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:29,810
early 90s scratch programming is

156
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,699
mostly visual, i.e. you

157
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,830
drag and drop blocks that

158
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,210
have different shapes and colors

159
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,639
same color of the blocks means the

160
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,279
same type of command belonging to the

161
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,740
same command family  only

162
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,409
compatible commands fit together and

163
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,719
this cannot fail to remember

164
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:50,120
the lego bricks in the sens  or that only

165
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,460
the bricks that have resignations

166
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,229
and compatible forms can

167
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:55,699
stick together

168
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,289
this is probably also due to the

169
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:59,000
fact that the author is actually a

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,940
consultant of the reading scratch teaches

171
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,469
two programming paradigms:

172
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:04,969
imperative programming and

173
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:07,250
event programming because  there are

174
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,190
the commands of when the program starts

175
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,409
you will have this or when

176
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:14,509
the hicks fi key is pressed

177
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:16,520
and this is taken up as we say

178
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,830
philosophy by smalltalk in fact the

179
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,779
very first test version of small

180
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,330
talk was written a variant of

181
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,349
smog which is called  squeak and is still

182
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:29,380
open source and is still active anyway

183
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,029
then I think that for portability reasons

184
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:35,479
they did it under adobe air and scratch

185
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:40,130
and also spread in Italy as well as in the

186
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,589
short down but it was practically the

187
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:44,810
coward zoe who knows that in Italy he has

188
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,360
led to a greater knowledge of

189
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,669
this language

190
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:55,550
and here we introduce the color dosio then

191
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,009
the coder dojo is a

192
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:02,330
international movement born in 2011 in ireland

193
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,649
by these two people on the

194
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:08,449
left there is james whelton who was a

195
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,899
student who said himself at one point he

196
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:13,729
said but if a child wants to play

197
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:16,580
football by soccer club after school

198
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,199
and learns  play football if a

199
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,120
child wants to learn to play a

200
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,259
musical instrument he can find

201
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,120
someone to use a hack to play an

202
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,880
instrument but if a child wants to

203
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,399
learn how to build a video game like he

204
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,349
does if a child wants to create a

205
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:36,260
website like he does he can't do it  and then it was

206
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,208
thought well to

207
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,828
create this real

208
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:45,509
after-school club for children in

209
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:50,100
which to introduce them to various

210
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,809
technological issues that can be precisely

211
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:54,740
from the construction of an app to the website,

212
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,119
the nice thing they did was

213
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:02,009
start with a  very open approach

214
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,040
regarding the constitution day

215
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,980
coder dojo which

216
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,839
spread very quickly all over the world due

217
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,179
to the extremely flexible format  sibile and

218
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,369
among other things in Italy

219
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:20,429
several coder dojo have recently been opened

220
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:26,009
in let's say whelton billia or the first

221
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:27,779
who founded the coder dojo have created

222
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,959
a foundation the l word fondation

223
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:33,240
designed to protect the name and in

224
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,790
some way be able to place  as a

225
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,709
hat that guarantees that the coder

226
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,819
doge done in a certain way

227
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:47,279
the term coder dojo yes indicates to me both

228
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,920
the international movement and the

229
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,660
people who make the activity of the coder

230
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,459
dojo is in fact a coder dojo is

231
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:00,990
an extremely free activity for

232
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,670
children  which has

233
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,040
particular characteristics the first is that it must be

234
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,309
totally free to participate,

235
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:09,689
i.e. the founders of the

236
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:12,049
movement and those who participate in it believe in the

237
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:16,170
total accessibility of this let

238
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,160
's say this initiative and therefore you

239
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,399
cannot make children pay and to

240
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,720
teach them to use these  technologies but

241
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,269
the movement is totally free

242
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:29,369
for this reason who coordinates the

243
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:31,259
movement, that is, who establishes a coder

244
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:32,899
do  jo usually does it on a

245
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:38,670
voluntary basis substantially the coder

246
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,589
dojos for this flexibility are

247
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:44,670
structured in various forms there are

248
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,079
the closest form to the

249
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,389
Irish movement which is the club so the

250
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:50,100
child comes

251
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,990
to an environment where you can meet his

252
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,880
other peers  passionate about

253
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,220
technologies and more adult figures the

254
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,459
mentors able to help them

255
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,470
build their project therefore the child

256
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,110
already has a project and wants to carry it out

257
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,759
in other forms as it can be more

258
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,139
similar to those that are here in

259
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:10,639
Italy which are instead of

260
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,490
educational activities where children are

261
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,440
introduced to these technologies and then they

262
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,300
are left free to build

263
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,250
what they want

264
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,050
the important thing however is the total

265
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,060
free and the voluntary basis on which

266
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,170
all the movement moves

267
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,329
during the course during the

268
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:35,260
coder dojo

269
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,710
we use  mainly scratch

270
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,450
open source tools

271
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,550
are preferred obviously the whole culture is preferred

272
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,650
collaborative and therefore

273
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,910
children are also encouraged to collaborate with each

274
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,620
other and therefore even

275
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,440
today's meeting is focused on scratch there is no

276
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,690
such constraint at the level of coder dojo

277
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,150
in the sense that in many other coder dojo

278
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,890
in Italy in the world children are

279
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,240
approach java script python arduino

280
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,670
raspberry and many other things, however,

281
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,040
the idea is always to

282
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,710
keep meetings extremely close to

283
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,440
what can be the latitude of the

284
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,630
child, that is, if the child

285
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,310
is left extremely free to participate in the dojo when he comes a little bit of the dojo

286
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,180


287
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,370
in which he believes he wants to

288
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,070
participate this is very nice because it

289
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,340
stimulates the creativity of children a lot

290
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,140
even during the coder dojo that at the

291
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,550
end of a coward joe that typically

292
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:40,600
lasts 2 3 hours a meeting the children

293
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,070
are able to build real

294
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,330
video games

295
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,070
just as they imagined them and

296
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,070
therefore do not repeat a tutorial that

297
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,070
we offer them this maybe we do it

298
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,080
for the  first half of the meeting but then

299
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,230
children are free to add

300
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,290
build and use scratch

301
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,400
as they deem appropriate

302
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,170
precisely the only rule of the coder dojo is

303
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,960
above all b cool that is, first of all,

304
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,880
have

305
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,370
fun we don't like bullying we don't

306
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,240
like children  who

307
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,330
want to cheat they want to take

308
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,740
shortcuts the most important thing is to

309
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,910
have fun being together and therefore also

310
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,260
introduce a certain

311
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,970
culture of collaboration before, but which then

312
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,420
also increases creativity when it becomes

313
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,709
infected also because one thing

314
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,600
on which the coder doger a was born

315
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,100
this of putting in contact children

316
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,709
who have this same

317
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:37,970
passion for technology this

318
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,980
same desire to use the computer

319
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,940
to build something

320
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,459
as he explained to you a meeting is

321
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,070
quite self-contained in the

322
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,200
way we propose the coder dojo

323
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,240
so during a meeting for example

324
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,959
we  we propose a tutorial to learn

325
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,320
with scratch a

326
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,830
I don't know how to move a mouse inside

327
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,490
a maze

328
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,520
ok so we teach them

329
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,930
what the concept of collision is the

330
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,520
concept of movement how they can

331
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,020
use the scratch blocks to do

332
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,370
this thing

333
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,110
we do it in an hour and a

334
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,390
half then after the  sacrosanct

335
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,760
snack break because a coder dojo

336
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,730
needs energy and therefore we and children

337
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,170
have to have a snack

338
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,200
the children are left free to

339
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,820
add things and then

340
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,290
mazes with secret passages and

341
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,010
many other things of the kind can be born

342
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,470
with regard to the coder dojo we

343
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,600
offer  we

344
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,710
the only limit of access is the fact that

345
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,810
the child brings a computer with him

346
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,480
in the sense that we are volunteers

347
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,180
we are not there is no association behind

348
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,280
coder dojo so we do not provide material

349
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,320
the important thing is that the child brings a

350
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,240
computer if it does not find it we try to

351
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,750
get it ourselves on which to install

352
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,240
scratch among other things,

353
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,340
scratch for ipad has also recently been released for those who do not

354
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,720
know here  ndi in reality they could

355
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,930
also bring an ipad a snack nor

356
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,000
coder dojo in padua we try to

357
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,650
make a common snack so children even

358
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,630
during the snack are encouraged

359
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,030
to stay together it is not that I bring the

360
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,840
sources and therefore eat better gay

361
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,000
lamela company but the  we put together and

362
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,920
try to create a

363
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,690
convivial moment even during the snack and

364
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,000
for a question of

365
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,500
insurance we ask the parents to

366
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,920
stop during the meeting and stay

367
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,780
there an insurance question opens up both

368
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,000
because we believe it is important that the

369
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,080
parents stay at the dojo stage to see

370
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,100
what happens because then at home when the

371
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,900
child picks up scratch they

372
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,260
are able to support him, stay close to him and

373
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,350
support him in the appropriate way, also

374
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,680
because something that happens to the

375
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,010
co of the doge because

376
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,860
maybe I didn't say well and that there are

377
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,840
these figures called mentors  that we are

378
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,780
basically adults who

379
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,810
are not trivially

380
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,000
computer experts for nie  Indeed, a meter may

381
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,590
not even know anything about a

382
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,390
computer hd if a

383
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,250
six-year-old child can do it alive god

384
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,330
anyone can really do it

385
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,450
in my opinion the important thing for the mentor is

386
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,000
the approach with which one is close to the

387
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,950
child is the  way in which we relate

388
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,560
therefore a very proactive approach

389
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,860
we try not to use not to

390
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,470
explain to the child how things are done but

391
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,330
to let him discover them we try

392
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,090
to encourage them also approve things

393
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,690
that is to try by mistake there is in the sense

394
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,810
for  we that the child is wrong and that the

395
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,610
mouse overcomes all the walls of the labyrinth

396
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,080
without going on him we do not care

397
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,850
the important that the child

398
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,050
realizes that the top should not

399
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,300
behave like this and therefore you are looking for a

400
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,520
solution so for us to make mistakes is

401
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,980
not not  it is a problem precisely this is also

402
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,740
something that we try to teach an

403
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,560
ancient dojo in Italy there are

404
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,510
really about they were born like mushrooms

405
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,869
in the last year and a half there is a site

406
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,060
coder doge italia where you  I call to

407
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,339
review all coder doge there is a

408
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,770
google group where anyone who wants to open a

409
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,690
coder dojo can enter and have support

410
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,330
to open a coder dojo, let

411
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,060
's say the only formal thing to do is go

412
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,450
to the international site and register there

413
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,350
this is the  'the only thing to do

414
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,420
the recipients can range from 4 to 17

415
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,730
years because obviously with younger

416
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,110
children you can do a lot of

417
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,570
unplugged activities that is without the use of the

418
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,030
computer introduce them to some concepts

419
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,430
of programming without the need to

420
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,870
use the computers with activities  very

421
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,430
funny and banal

422
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,960
we turn to children aged 7

423
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,160
12 because we use scratch

424
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,770
basically so far we ask for

425
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,320
free hospitality provided by

426
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,780
coworking spaces schools

427
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,530
libraries and the movement has grown

428
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,710
so much that

429
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,539
this year the maker faire will have a

430
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:16,929
dedicated space  at coder dojo

431
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,440
italia and we will propose various

432
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,920
repetition workshops and here in veneto in padua

433
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,320
we were born on 15 feb  aio of this year

434
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,700
in fossò on 22 March

435
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,470
we would like to understand if there are others and

436
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,510
others with other similar initiatives in the

437
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,120
Veneto region because it would seem that even

438
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,800
in montebelluna it should leave just

439
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,600
now in September another coder doge we

440
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,409
do not know in Verona

441
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,510
these are two photos of  'event in fossò

442
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,710
is held inside the

443
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,090
municipal library while in padua

444
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,610
we went to the talent garden now

445
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,680
we are mainly at the talent lab which

446
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,940
is another space that I don't know if you

447
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,120
know that there is in padua with

448
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,910
fab lab inside other nice things there  these are

449
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,070
two sites on which if you want you can

450
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,960
go and find out more information even if

451
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,670
I think I have really told you everything

452
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,910
we were I am giulio a name

453
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,280
he and andrea ferraresso la pira giovanna

454
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,410
greets you very much and we have

455
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,110
overstepped the minutes a little but

456
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,200
if you have  questions or anything else

457
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,299
what I invite you to do is come to a

458
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,370
coder dojo see how it works to

459
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,230
have fun and go home to

460
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,630
make video games with sc  ratch and if you have any

461
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,780
questions if you want to do a bit of the dojo

462
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,650
some of you want to do a bit of the

463
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:46,640
dojo no too direct there is a question

464
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,059
never

465
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:58,149
yes yes

466
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,090
the c

467
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,740
no

468
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,460
so let's say that scratch is a

469
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,799
closed technology as far as

470
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,720
development is concerned because it is  the mit that carries it

471
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,450
out but is not developed in

472
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,920
a closed way, i.e. in the sense you can

473
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,870
participate in the development but I don't know

474
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,910
frankly tell you in what terms

475
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,220
I don't know if they give you the source code and

476
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,210
things like that

477
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:42,179
program is called foundations

478
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,200
relax a little

479
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,820
no

480
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,760
what I say they

481
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,379
love which

482
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,270
bound

483
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,610
no

484
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,750
or

485
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:09,730
yes we say

486
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,539
yes then we say that the child

487
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:16,150
does not pass this thing because for how

488
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,289
scratch works and the scratch community now

489
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:21,700
I don't have the connection so I can't

490
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,630
but could I connect yes yes

491
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:33,100
yes then yes yes but  he at 16 17

492
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,630
probably stopped using scratch

493
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,010
I'll tell you about scratch and a

494
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,020
fantastic program is not that

495
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,510
you develop with it who knows what kind of

496
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,640
programs fi programs i  n in flash

497
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,370
basically this is what it

498
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,190
is for how the scratch community works

499
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,760


500
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,159
the emphasis is that the

501
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:52,630
child can navigate the programs

502
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,850
the executable the program has done and

503
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,490
finished play with it do whatever it

504
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,669
wants and then to a  gigantic big button

505
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,799
with written I look at the code inside

506
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,450
and remix it that is there is no strong remix and

507
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,400
add things and roll it out there is the tree

508
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,740
that shows you how on the tabs that shows you

509
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,140
the fork tree show it of the holes

510
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,690
that  so the accent is that is,

511
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,820
the concept of opening the code is pushed a lot

512
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,830
the code with which

513
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,120
the flash program was made

514
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,340
what is under it actually

515
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,280
is not is not is not open but I presume

516
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,100
that the mit did it for  the

517
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,990
simplicity of installation and access

518
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,030
of this of this product frankly

519
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,039
I can not tell you I think that of course they will

520
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,200
also discuss it too

521
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,539
the idea however is that you push the

522
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:42,970
culture of the home or a program and

523
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,700
I can see how it was  nziona this is the

524
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,190
concept that is in the sense this is not this is not

525
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,450
what I see the child

526
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,380
when the on scratch

527
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,659
but the program has done and finished and can

528
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:55,750
see how the source code of the

529
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,789
program then let's say if they love it to

530
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:00,070
grow and will ask you  at 16

531
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,480
he purely stopped using scratch

532
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,150
at 16 17 he is using python

533
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,080
anything else

534
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,309
not to the courses the python courses the courses

535
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:14,429
there is a python course aimed

536
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:20,220
at 14 15 year olds so yes not very good

537
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,139
observation  however, unfortunately it is

538
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:25,049
a question to be asked to mit in the sense I

539
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:25,980
believe that they did it for a

540
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,840
question of accessibility of the product

541
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,509
we have to close other questions out

542
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:36,289
with a beer

543
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:40,129
thanks
