1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,870
12 on air good morning everyone we are at es

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,150
que 2014 and at this moment there will be the

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,880
presentation of peak by haydn hunt who

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,040
has a module for ip the boss to do

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,480
shorthand award of

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,179
tcp ip packages and after which there will be a

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,770
surprise presentation  of the project

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,170
track maps have fallen august of

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,850
the study center hermes transparency

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,560
human rights on the net and my e-mail and old

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,750
consola global x.org because he

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,400
works in this globaleaks project that

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,990
I advise you to look at or better still

14
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,590
to wait half an hour because then  we will do

15
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,210
half an hour on globaleaks web in this

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,390
room then hydra 3 is a module for ip

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,030
the boss the purpose is to ensure that when you

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,379
activate it on a server and on a client,

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,270
a connection can be established that

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,670
if it is intercepted and

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,030
controlled by a third party  party considers

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,360
third party could be could be

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,050
deceived

24
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,609
what are the specific problems you

25
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,420
want to solve a cescon an access

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,689
control cooler than portugal king

27
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:09,060
and king  sistance to jacking at level 4

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,869
then to notice the bpt there is the

29
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:15,509
defeat of the Chinese tests

30
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,670
used against the tower three

31
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,720
totally different problems

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,030
let's see them individually then the port

33
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,830
the port with hawking here is the mechanism

34
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,380
that the system administrators use to

35
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,140
protect their services  a

36
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,790
server know that there are

37
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,710
zero day answers they know that if they left

38
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,369
all the services exposed to for them as an

39
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:36,960
example in itself they bag the administration or

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,790
for statistics or other they could

41
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,009
risk having violations

42
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,869
this bothers them it would annoy them

43
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,390
then with the knocking port they do  yes that they

44
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,000
send packets before it exists

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,979
establish session these packets are not

46
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,990
used to contain

47
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,450
a connection rod but how much more to

48
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,610
demonstrate that someone wants to connect

49
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,810
to that hidden door

50
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,020
lost is configured to system engineer lost and

51
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,850
recognizes these packets and

52
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,860
consequently opens the door  only for a

53
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,600
limiter in c time this creates and

54
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,810
port no ch  i means knocking to

55
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,300
find a door closed or open bus and at

56
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,150
that point the lai jacking is open

57
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,040
instead that attack that has

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,350
always existed very high ps between always someone

59
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,940
is intercepting the conversion of 6 p

60
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,070
could say client now you stop

61
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,610
working

62
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,170
you  I send a packet that closes the

63
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,610
connection you the one that is closed

64
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,250
server you are practical client but now

65
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,870
having his address he

66
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,920
starts communicating in his name and and

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,090
consequently to continue to carry

68
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,710
on the connection as if it were

69
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,240
another one from the started a real  I am

70
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,070
therefore imagining that we are talking

71
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,830
about a protocol in clear text and to send

72
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,970
an email

73
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,180
starts stand rows who is the recipient

74
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,010
hijacker the person and a half interrupts

75
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,340
your sending of mails you will see an error or

76
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,990
could even be deceived that it deserves her

77
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,270
in the square correctly and then  the person

78
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,980
and a half and inter write it mail in

79
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:10,700
your place and the other point instead the teacher

80
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,190
owns are a mechanism that has

81
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,640
invented the  promptly china as the

82
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,709
first state for massive expansion

83
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,690
to identify the connections made with

84
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,480
thor thor you all know what is still

85
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,370
anonymity mechanism that in some

86
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,440
states in itself tried

87
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,280
to block normally to block it it

88
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,280
will happen that a state intercepts the

89
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,620
connections that come out of its  state

90
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,060
look at the type of traffic there is and

91
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,310
if it is thor-type traffic is blocked

92
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,140
then thor had already done years ago

93
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,900
to simulate the https protocol because htps

94
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,240
with the protocol that contains a lot

95
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,250
of legitimate and business-related activities

96
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,370
that cannot  be blocked

97
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,840
then what China has done to

98
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,890
discriminate if an https connection

99
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,710
really compresses that you of ps or top ten

100
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,440
and in the great Chinese firewall one of the

101
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,880
probes that are monitoring the

102
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,230
connections when it sees a connection

103
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,630
coming out of china to a machine

104
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,130
in https  within 15 minutes any ip

105
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,980
assigned to the Chinese space

106
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,680
makes a connection to lost to

107
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,890
which there is  it is the connection to be discovered by

108
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,540
making connection who is

109
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,240
pressing the clients see if he answers

110
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,160
bull today answers home types of answers

111
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,750
thor puts it black list

112
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,180
if you answer actp says no it is a

113
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,590
service that I tell you I did not know melo

114
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,070
marks so there are really three types of

115
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,290
quite different problems these

116
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,240
two here are more or less similar

117
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,650
in both cases what you want to

118
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,930
achieve is that whoever wants to reach a

119
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,340
certain service of that knowledge

120
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,080
may have a mechanism to

121
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,340
achieve it but why it must be

122
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,650
explained graphically because if you are the

123
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,580
how  call 100 against chinese

124
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,130
the department no but the

125
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,600
god department does

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,200
not you but amanda chinese between the lights are

127
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,400
similar and you see a connection that is

128
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,440
particularly different is a

129
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,120
protocol that you do not know you could

130
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,710
also say if not like this protocol

131
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,780
block so what to do  it

132
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,320
is not to create new

133
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,390
employment mechanisms but to create but to create

134
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,590
mechanisms that will come  confused

135
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,590
for others then the trait of precisely

136
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,940
the definition that someone is digging

137
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,520
to host and flaunting connected

138
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,350
connections sees an

139
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,930
incoming connection tries to connect and what

140
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,670
he will see is a different service from

141
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:03,280
the one in between

142
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,690
you understand the problem  ok then

143
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,760
there is the nephew of the bosses feeding

144
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,340
for many years of destination milk on 6

145
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,690
days one thing when it is applied

146
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,220
but applies it to everyone the

147
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,410
station nat and way to say you are

148
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,180
with me by connecting my ep to port 80

149
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,090
but in truth I am  using this port

150
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,980
only because the company firewall

151
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,720
allows it but to be connected to

152
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,640
another port behind me then use

153
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,100
the destination born so as to change

154
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,750
the destination address to this by

155
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,550
connecting the connection you are

156
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,890
establishing is still made towards post and

157
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,560
port  primary even if in truth it is

158
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,030
parrying with the other simplicity

159
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,220
this which is an example of how to send

160
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,120
this

161
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,710
command  act before the packet

162
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,260
denies rooted registers on the

163
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,810
withdrawal table a nat specifies the protocol

164
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,250
in this case if the

165
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,340
source port is 1 2 3 4 5 and the destination

166
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,990
22 then turns on port 22 22

167
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,570
this makes us understand that if one

168
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,120
connect to port 22 of this but

169
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,200
only if the

170
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,020
source port is 13 45 then it will reach

171
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,670
another whim same h all other

172
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,920
people will reach inserted same h

173
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,500
of the machine on this big party

174
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,080
this rule is this thing makes us understand

175
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,160
how simplified mind  it can happen to

176
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,870
trafficking instead it is based on the fact that

177
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,940
there are 2bite randò mitch inside

178
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,040
the package the pinks are called lipids

179
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,050
in the pd it is used to

180
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,370
uniquely identify a package so that it

181
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,430
is fragmented

182
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,700
what matters

183
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:15,530
antonini can be constructed ok these  this this

184
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,850
2 byte value simply has to be

185
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,220
random but what if what

186
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,020
if instead being random

187
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,800
was psi auto r  andom and the server side machine

188
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,530
simply waits for the

189
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,270
specific sequence in case this

190
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,240
specific sequence is respected then it

191
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,710
continues to forward your packets to

192
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,510
the other service in case this

193
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,490
sequence breaks

194
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,830
then imagine that someone has taken

195
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,419
control of the connection in this way

196
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,360
we are managing to discriminate the fact

197
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,120
that this

198
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,320
apparently anatomical data sequence can be

199
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,080
used as self-indication then

200
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,640
this sequence must only

201
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,560
be derived from a

202
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,360
cryptographic key previously shared

203
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,390
between client and server and consequently

204
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,800
this allows us to even have

205
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,510
multiple sequences  in memory of

206
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,850
sequences of which from when it begins to be

207
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,850
respected it is possible to associate the connected

208
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,710
of a specific user and this

209
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,510
specific user can be redirected

210
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,140
to a service of thirty that

211
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,910
publicly visible is a work in

212
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,570
progress

213
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,160
this here is the repository in which

214
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,770
I have yet to comment on the codi  we did it and

215
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,600
above all the graphic safety is still missing

216
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,520
because it can be a little

217
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,960
more difficult than the graphic one

218
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,670
because the available bytes are very

219
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,770
few there are three usable bytes in the

220
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,290
entropy available amount at the

221
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,480
beginning of connection to all  'internal

222
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,490
seizure because a 4-byte post but

223
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,170
because of the sin cookies only three

224
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,340
are available

225
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,680
and then there are the c2 bytes of the iti this

226
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,540
means that there are five countries

227
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,270
available knowing that every time

228
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,650
there is a photographic publication it is

229
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,810
necessary  put a few bytes of

230
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,740
random padding so that the operation that

231
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,460
is iterated generates an always

232
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,200
different result then we must use

233
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,270
at least two integrity huts and the

234
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,230
large pads

235
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,980
and then one to identify the user

236
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,860
you are trying to indicate and two that

237
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,090
are  instead those for authentication

238
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,970
so the room for maneuver is very

239
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,400
little despite this is how it works here

240
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,590
understand for a moment how to visualize

241
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,740
what happened  and when you want to change

242
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,190
this parameter this field

243
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,850
inside the pp this lidi indicated

244
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,090
aticipi dump that appears at the beginning of the

245
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,820
leder with these two advantageous values ici

246
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,710
this full connection that occurs in

247
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,710
a normal way and if you want to modify it

248
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,630
you can try with  h ping to gennaro of

249
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,480
packets that have specified what type

250
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,870
of id they will have and it is actually seen

251
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:02,000
that this is rightly

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,050
affected and those few bytes are

253
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,100
still sufficient to be able to

254
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,720
discriminate if a connection is

255
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,240
respecting this sequence and therefore is

256
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,800
still the one established by the user  who

257
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,230
actually wanted to communicate with us

258
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:15,620
or not

259
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,170
the implementation requires two levels

260
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,330
of patching a user space and a flesh

261
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,980
space because that is how it works the more the

262
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,970
boss

263
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,560
there is a small part of the library that

264
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,070
extends the options you understand boss

265
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,590
offers you is the  check of the options that

266
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,250
are there and then the internal one that instead

267
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,840
implements the mechanism of nothing

268
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,030
what I want  levo add to this

269
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:45,530
mechanism is on server side

270
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,240
this is what happens client

271
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,420
side and client side you define that if you match

272
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,670
to another destination or a certain

273
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,090
source or a certain port then

274
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,810
apply this key this user

275
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,550
this means that if you are too

276
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,350
by contacting a service that does not have

277
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,480
hayden to you you are modifying the

278
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,240
parameters that are anyway

279
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,170
legitimately random so it is not

280
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,580
that it is impacting by ruining your

281
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,960
connection to others you could

282
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,270
say I only have a height

283
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,340
nat user and consequently all

284
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,920
connected outgoing

285
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,130


286
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,529
only the services that are actually

287
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:24,940
using this mechanism have this type of application that other

288
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,240
server trigger year

289
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,670
server side authentication instead what you need is to

290
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,399
specify a device a device like

291
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,029
slash depp something no slash proc

292
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:39,639
slash something because they are interfaces

293
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,110
with which  user space programs

294
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,820
can communicate with robben kernel

295
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,550
because qu  This is because to be able to

296
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,920
make a pipette so low

297
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,070
level usable by applications of

298
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,029
2014 it

299
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:55,320
is necessary that it be controllable via

300
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,930
ex di toe ai and therefore have a service

301
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,579
that can say look at the student you

302
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,410
want to connect this key that I have

303
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,829
pre-established in a channel  different a

304
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:08,050
user can authenticate or establish

305
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,389
his key that will last for days years

306
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:16,269
months or minutes and such the user will get

307
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:20,350
his connection this is what

308
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,290
must always happen on the server side therefore

309
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,990
the part of the process open in the heart

310
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,589
are the combinations of  key user

311
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:31,540
and distraction this because on a single

312
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,459
service you can also destination

313
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,949
mattar and multiple services and according to

314
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,980
the user who is coming to turn it over the

315
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,360
strong point is that if a person

316
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,399
is intercepting he does not notice one what

317
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,190
he notices is not a different protocol

318
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,350
but  if anything, from different patterns,

319
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,970
pacific traffic analysis steps for

320
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,040
African resists when

321
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,259
you see that if you do  expect the

322
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:59,170
connection to an http service you

323
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,540
expect patterns such as few requests

324
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,070
and many responses

325
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,149
if instead you if the ash sh will have

326
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:09,430
constant requests for a byte is a bite

327
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,449
that they will have to return because it is so

328
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,579
functional echo on a console therefore

329
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:15,339
this type of analysis that  it is however a

330
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:17,680
higher level can still understand that

331
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,000
there is a protocol difference this

332
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,160
type of analysis can still be

333
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,199
deceived with two paddling mechanisms

334
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,920
or simply by having

335
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,500
different services but of the same type therefore

336
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,449
or an http service with a contribution to

337
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:33,370
give to everyone  and who knows authentic saw

338
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,079
another one

339
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:37,000
ok this here was the first part the

340
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,170
presentation o or three minutes for

341
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:41,740
what I have

342
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:49,089
left note chemically at

343
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,540
15.30 the talks become globaleaks twisted web and

344
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,480
we do it in many more people

345
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,560
than which  I want to talk to you in a

346
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,050
very short time because we

347
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,230
still have sixteen minutes with 16 minutes it's

348
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,389
time to have a heart attack  and axis

349
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:08,620
recovered what I want to talk to you

350
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,209
instead later is the project called

351
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,170
track map there is time for a question of

352
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:23,529
me no they are two things that just do not

353
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:25,800
touch I

354
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,750
understand that the only case in which they

355
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,730
could possibly green conflicts

356
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,399
could be with  the device in proc

357
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,100
but no if one that if a kernel creates a

358
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,170
device already returned is not

359
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,969
telling it you cannot write to it

360
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,950
ah no precisely because having a

361
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,050
well-defined sequence causes that as soon as you no

362
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,029
longer have the secret to be able to compute the

363
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:00,070
next idea  due to the

364
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,160
true golden connection known as

365
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,240
injected that is side, however, indicate the non-

366
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,010
having that you put the first packet or

367
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:25,389
according to other ancients each packet to

368
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,459
divide the part that you

369
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:30,579
ok I understand the right answer is the

370
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:32,920
typographic part not yet defined

371
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,510
because I wanted to be able to  and

372
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,769
funding that of the network and then

373
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:40,980
ask for expert cryptography

374
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,180
for now that there is no code

375
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:07,839
the standard now random but I knew

376
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,400
well  clothes on the dedicated option

377
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,890
allow random linux there is the option of

378
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,130
maxi random and looking at the two

379
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,689
packages in seizures as always two

380
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:19,689
things very past each other

381
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:21,819
we can find out later with a few shots

382
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,280
of cracks but I am convinced that there is

383
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:30,429
currently a good reasonable  random

384
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:35,980
mentions me it must also be said that yes what

385
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,080
one could intensify the worst that

386
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,820
lacks incremental ta in the case and it

387
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,140
would still be possible to have

388
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,179
big shifts because youtubers have

389
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:47,590
local traffic that is not seen now

390
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,539
external and therefore increases the

391
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:51,130
counter of the shores  but look I am

392
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,450
really convinced that if random

393
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,500
track maps seen for a moment is in

394
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,540
summary it will serve to demonstrate that the

395
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,320
national media

396
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,570
we use the media as a case study for

397
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,450
the truth any type of site

398
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,620
dedicated to a population is good for

399
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,120
this type of case

400
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,700
these national media these national media

401
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,990
often click lead

402
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,340
outside the nation

403
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,190
itself  information related to what the user what

404
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,900
citizens are looking for the media are

405
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,630
the useful case because they represent the

406
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,870
type of sites that if

407
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,020
passively analyzed demonstrate the interest of

408
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,630
a specific person or a

409
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,920


410
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,650
geographically localized population or group then I

411
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,480
made this presentation  at the

412
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,460
journalism party that wanted to

413
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,470
analyze the Italian media now flows

414
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,000
extremely quickly because this one

415
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,400
lasted 40 minutes and I miss them and it pulls

416
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,920
let's say that I have a maximum of 10 minutes

417
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,090
this presentation explained in

418
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,280
summary how it is done so taking

419
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,110
43 thousand Italians let's say to  case but by

420
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,020
order of use a connection was made

421
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,900
with phantom js phantom and gds

422
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,780
is firefox that runs without showing it

423
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,940
console but that runs in the console without

424
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,920
showing the window to their home

425
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,110
page all the connections

426
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,330
are shown that are stimulated so every time

427
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,610
it is  a banner a tracker

428
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,310
the facebook login so they are all

429
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,990
c  connections that your banks your

430
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,270
club browser is making but that you have not really

431
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,890
requested because you want to

432
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,890
go to ansa.it that also goes to

433
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,420
facebook is not your purpose

434
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,080
on each of these inclusions so they

435
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,420
are third-party servers you do

436
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,490
traceroute 3 all  demonstrates all the

437
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,450
steps that your connection must

438
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,800
carry out to reach them all these

439
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,210
steps are identified with an

440
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,280
ip address very often

441
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,830
carrier and provider

442
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,870
ip address all these ip addresses can be resolved

443
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,360
geographically i.e. gp is a mechanism

444
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,040
that allows you to tell if a certain

445
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,510
address  it is associated with a certain

446
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,529
country or a company of that

447
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:09,210
so I do everything destroyed from here to

448
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,129
loop I expect to pass by

449
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:20,759
let's do it traceroute www.ansa.it

450
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,980
what should happen now is that without

451
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,049
using the type minus option n

452
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:28,169
so I avoid  give me the resolution minus

453
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:29,879
time out

454
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:38,249
was as I remember but the network works

455
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:40,109
yes because if you reached this here well

456
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:43,529
anyway  to here there are solutions you do by

457
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:45,480
saying look it is passing through

458
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,669
internal classes then class 10 up to

459
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:48,960
here that can be those internet

460
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,509
that after which you go out on this

461
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:54,269
ip address that does not actually know who it is

462
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:55,169
or what it is

463
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:58,200
then use geo  ip lookup as a utility

464
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,379
that tells you it's Italian ok thanks

465
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:05,700
this is here instead geo ip lookup a we

466
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,889
went to you at the kingdom this is

467
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:14,759
here instead we are still in great britain

468
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,889
then maybe we can get a little more ideas

469
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:18,960
we could say let's see hosts on these

470
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,999
pipes we are  seymour reverse and makes us

471
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:24,359
understand that we are on inter.it puntonet

472
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,059
which can be a cdm therefore of the

473
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,980
content delivery network systems that

474
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,679
are used for traffic results in

475
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,590
order to better distribute on, however,

476
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,499
seeing the part of our name mille

477
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:39,950
cales corpus that seems to  is a

478
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,409
router of a carrier and therefore we know

479
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:44,999
that we are traveling to England

480
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:47,759
even if officially going towards loop

481
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,710
there could be something that is

482
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,489
local yes

483
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:04,070
if there is this case to the check that the

484
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:10,300
internet was a simple mystery

485
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,030
both things and at the moment I am

486
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,470
doing research activities to be able to

487
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,200
understand how you can better locate it

488
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,000
even true that for what you can

489
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,070
go to prove if there was a

490
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,200
seated leclé international  letters that

491
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,010
says dear interoute since you are from

492
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,660
the united kingdom and since it is subject to

493
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,700
our secret service to please

494
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,250
from a pole on traffic or from the sky this

495
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,170
possibility of legal coercion there

496
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,390
would still be so what

497
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,950
we see here with jp is that a range  di p is

498
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,410
present in a country or registered to

499
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,330
a company of that country because it may

500
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,110
happen that you reach the

501
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:57,070
akamai servers in Italy and it tells you these these

502
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:11,610
classes are associated with America but

503
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,740
historical insertion was all

504
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,510
Italian g stall but let's see  status from

505
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,460
English so I certainly do not know how to give you

506
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,170
a right answer in this

507
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,400
regard,

508
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,970
let's say the details on how you can

509
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,540
learn more  and and return to the question

510
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,420
raised the gp we will see them because they

511
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,130
are something to improve

512
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,740
for now we dedicate the next few minutes

513
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,260
to explain this research done this

514
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,100
type of realization they pull out

515
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,650
a map and consequently in

516
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,890
this way this test was done

517
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,120
for Italy of  consequently I had done

518
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,100
this south and thousand Italians so

519
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,950
what among the holes for example that huffington

520
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,169
post and or calcionapoli24 were

521
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,419
including all these third party bullies

522
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:11,100
adn kronos courier and fan page on

523
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,870
all these others to start

524
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,130
making some graphics but what more

525
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,070
it was also interesting to understand in light

526
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,410
of the fact that mechanisms like fox acid

527
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,110
of n 66 a connection passing through

528
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,090
one of your controlled routers can

529
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,740
be used to inject

530
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,820
malware and compromise the machine

531
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,400
what place of what I wanted to

532
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,650
prove was that if a  media is

533
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,500
including right third parties

534
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,290
cause its users are exposed to

535
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:47,510
foreign nations and caus  to which its users are

536
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,990
lost the confidentiality of the users and

537
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,169
therefore exposed them analysis as well as

538
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:57,600
active attacks

539
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,730
then I gave out of the output

540
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,640
of this type to show how an

541
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,030
Italian myth touches truth many other

542
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,510
nations and depending on each media there

543
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,160
this little color was dedicated

544
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,860
to South America in truth the

545
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,510
French Guinea so it lights up when you

546
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,919
pass in France it is not that something

547
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,179
passes in South America

548
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:22,659
this here was the prototype made

549
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:26,330
in April what then happened is that

550
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,460
I contracted the project thanks

551
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,020
to the  support of a group

552
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,480
of German facts called caltech collective and

553
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,370
this repository re is the pagan struck

554
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,210
is containing both list of many other

555
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,340
media around the world

556
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,400
so make sure that it is not according to analysis

557
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,409
linked to a specific country but to

558
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:50,510
all the country protection of the  world

559
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,299
for now i have all these and then there

560
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:55,789
are others that i don't review because to

561
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:58,100
have a good media list i have

562
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,770
qu  some of the place that knows them and

563
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,450
validates them above all what is useful is

564
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,669
a division between national and

565
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:09,110
local media because the parma courier

566
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,500
identifies you more geographically

567
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,870
because you are a Parma

568
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,610
citizen, but it is probably not all the

569
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,730
Italian citizens who later want to check

570
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,520
how much they are  exposed the local media must also see

571
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,200


572
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,049
at this moment at the proposed level

573
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:28,570
there is this but here better

574
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,669
organized very slow which is made up

575
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:33,559
of some of the data that I am starting to

576
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,899
receive thanks to

577
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:39,010
distributed analysis because there are two steps

578
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,409
when one  state wants to be added

579
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:47,990
must first be able to have its media

580
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:50,600
list placed in the middle east verified

581
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,669
and then have someone who in the

582
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:54,409
single state or in a server of that

583
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:56,000
state run the script

584
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,789
the script is in fact a lot of ds3

585
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:01,659
strutte gp and then sends  results

586
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:03,919
towards our iden service

587
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,169
if you always have spaces for the world and

588
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:11,630
have media knowledge of non-countries

589
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,360
present here and you want to contribute that is

590
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,890
explained how to do it but afterwards I will

591
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,200
also gladly dedicate some minutes I

592
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,330
missed no there are still two minutes left for

593
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,440
everything

594
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,850
and these here we see little of the

595
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:30,350
results that were here like Italy

596
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:35,620
national media we bring the press

597
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,639
and show that  these there are

598
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:41,720
relationships and which are included with 24

599
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,309
unwanted connections his mind due to the

600
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:45,799
fact that he is using me the press and or at

601
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,429
the moment

602
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,860
based on the hosts included and

603
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,340
then solving which kind of kompany

604
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,149
away behind you see which are the some

605
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:00,799
not  recognized as an account with

606
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,210
what a bit embarrassing because then you see

607
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,159
google what is associated with what nielsen knows about the

608
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,009
world and twitter of

609
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:11,210
those of there are now some countries

610
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,100
the project is still

611
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,929
officially released so this sort of

612
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:19,669
prototype preview and you can precisely

613
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:23,059
select the perfumes you read from

614
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:24,590
to actually provide how many

615
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,230
countries they can potentially know

616
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,429
c  What are you doing

617
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:31,279
thanks to the fact that it sees going from the

618
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,049
cookies that are passing through who you are

619
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:36,320
what you were doing before and from what news

620
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,049
you are coming from and the list of all

621
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,980
the companies that are tracking and

622
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,980
are implicitly put this here

623
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,620
wanting up company hi hi media can

624
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,899
also be a bit of a criticism of the fact

625
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:52,970
that currently the way to do

626
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,409
information online is based on the fact

627
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:56,570
that a newspaper has to make a lot of

628
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,389
impressions the quality suffers

629
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:01,429
because journalists are tempted to

630
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:03,259
simply translate news abroad in

631
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:05,389
order to do  impressions because they earn

632
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:07,879
thanks to banners and this does not go in the

633
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,169
direction of quality information

634
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:12,259
but apart from these reflections

635
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,509
specifically on the media

636
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:17,690
this analysis could also be applied on

637
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,759
different lists as an example

638
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:20,840
you are a citizen who goes to the

639
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,399
public administration public

640
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,389
administration

641
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:26,210
you want  that the stuff remains in Italy or you

642
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,309
are happy to know that it turns as

643
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,779
long as it turns in Europe  a i am still all

644
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:31,009
sexual milky days from her privacy

645
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:33,649
at the moment you read she turns to

646
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:34,610
russia

647
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,670
what changes when the pia

648
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,100
uses a server hosted on amazon

649
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,470
what it means you know this way

650
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,620
at least you can know it visually

651
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,179
now i wanted to show you a  nice

652
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:53,030
traceroute that came from palestine

653
00:29:53,030 --> 00:30:02,240
where there was a tour how bizarre maybe

654
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,290
this has developed some pies that

655
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:11,990
are seen in the back end side and this

656
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,090
plan of the output examples to be

657
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,780
clarified on the topic geolocation

658
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,850
this here is an inclusion the  inclusion of the

659
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,260
host v

660
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,120
share this point com those of you who use

661
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,070
written sometimes see that it appears and the

662
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,140
Sardinians can run scripts and

663
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,690
allow it you allow it in this media

664
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,970
www all iamm dot com which is a

665
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,790
Palestinian media the 3 south tells us let's start

666
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,590
from  from the Palestinian territory

667
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,169
we go to the united kingdom

668
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:44,600
we have in the head we find the united kingdom

669
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,190
passed through israel we go back to

670
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:49,880
palestine and this is at least an

671
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,309
atypic tour  or so I guess that the question

672
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:55,760
of reliable jp is not that

673
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,070
reliable, surely this

674
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,980
connection is going through routers that

675
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,520
are not Palestinian and therefore some

676
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,190
of the entities indicated in the middle could

677
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,590
also seem to duplicate what

678
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,000
traffic and from the informative point of view

679
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,130
of the project I think  that it is

680
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,750
still acceptable to give this

681
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,590
information

682
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,440
I am looking in the best cases to

683
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,390
better perhaps identify how the

684
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,299
routing moves as if it moves

685
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,580
etc. Consider that a few months after

686
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,340
that on the other hand, russia has

687
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,900
one of the things that born russia all

688
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,600
bring  of the new internet cables so that

689
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,460
the connections passed through

690
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,260
russia and no longer through the

691
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,150
previous providers, however, I evicted badly

692
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,679
so

693
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:58,400
too many questions ok keyword three questions and if

694
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:06,650
who is there from tokyo after thanks thanks

695
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,290
soft assembly the consent of the extension will be held

696
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:13,300
september questions

697
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,040
yes but I think that before affirming a

698
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,170
will it is important  and understand where

699
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,180
the connections are going

700
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:35,000
so it is also possible that the routing

701
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,450
is hijacked for intelligence purposes

702
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,510
I would not want to cry

703
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,250
wolf before it is true and I

704
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,290
advise you to follow the talk of

705
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,240
marco di itri of today south  peering

706
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,220
and why the local traffic must

707
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,020
stay in the local nation

708
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,300
I love you

709
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,179
and say that the shot

710
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,659
the beautiful from the private ones

711
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:16,289
what

712
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,220
those close to me know but it is

713
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,430
wright who assigns them so it

714
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,820
depends on who has been assigned

715
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,230
it is not a question of self-declaration

716
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:36,700
yes yes yes exactly

717
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,150
it is public and in

718
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,330
fact there is also the problem of the vault that

719
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,890
you have not specifically assigned it to

720
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:49,210
an action but to a continent sometimes

721
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,090
I find myself europe which means europe

722
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,590
that has europe i

723
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,390
don't know however  is that of the data that I have

724
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,450
for the moment ideally circling

725
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,730
the bus system which is another data of

726
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,520
which I can get some

727
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,450
information of the tablets type 10

728
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:10,030
palestinian 3 south so that they are the

729
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,340
output that I receive from testers and

730
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,460
around the world

731
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:23,460
and what I am looking for ok this is where the

732
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,330
verb treslove these here are

733
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:32,199
the output of 3 sud and what you see

734
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,909
here also the autonomist in which you

735
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:36,159
pass autonomous system identifies more

736
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,980
easily the carrier, however, also endorsed

737
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,870
by texas and supranational moments that on

738
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,969
google its autonomous system and is

739
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:44,679
scattered around the world or google has not

740
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,980
been specifically to a donation

741
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,899
despite responding to American law

742
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:54,210
so the data to pass from three struth to

743
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:57,190
a law to  any object is not so

744
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,350
immediate but it is still the

745
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,279
useful reflection to be

746
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,220
told

747
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:35,200
the cdn book of different extremes rather

748
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,360
than take out I wanted the stars so

749
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,940
I do revolver and then reverse from

750
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,730
the reverse reserves I see if you are a cdn

751
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,490
because they are linked to a specific list

752
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,710
ugly cdm is that maybe you see

753
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,680
facebook cdm that comes to you in Italy

754
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,180
because it is using Italians or

755
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,380
the connection also comes out of Italy

756
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,170
but sapen  do that is the facebook cdm you already

757
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,870
associate with arrives in america because in

758
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,780
any case it is under the state of the american city

759
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,530


760
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,020
so in this case the routing

761
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,110
should tell you arrival trip for three

762
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,850
opa in italy and then arrived in america

763
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,010
there is no graphic passage of the

764
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,780
connection however  coming to

765
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,100
cdn and the other

766
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,700
is what I wanted is expanding a bit

767
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,620
however there are various directions of

768
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,320
expansion between analyzing how

769
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,590
the injected scripts change then turning up more

770
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,510
javascript to see if they are

771
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,970
tracking destinies such as evercookie used

772
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,490
or not rather than if

773
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,520
call call  call canvas that I recognize

774
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,370
a hardware as discovered that it did to

775
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:57,090
data and therefore analyze more the

776
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,420
direction of the types of scripts that are

777
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,640
enticed or devote more to the

778
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,320
geographical issue or also devote to

779
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,190
the laws

780
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,490
in the sense that we are treated as

781
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,500
foreign citizens  therefore with less rights

782
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,980
than national citizens and this

783
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,510
we know only about America that

784
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,550
we are second-class citizens  as long as we are

785
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,490
foreign because we have discovered this

786
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,890
from the articulated relations and the debate

787
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,380
that has developed about it however we

788
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,600
do not know how we are treated in russia

789
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,770
or our state connections in russia

790
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:31,830
even from the analysis of the peta you will see

791
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,210
that our connections also pass

792
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:36,330
through russia sometimes  or for japan and

793
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:36,960
so on

794
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,550
maybe even that type of research can

795
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,010
be useful or eviction really too much

796
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,320
so it is better if the pressure of

797
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,030
the global link project if they come here

798
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,260
thanks for your attention

799
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,700
and after if you want we can talk about it

800
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,850
again
