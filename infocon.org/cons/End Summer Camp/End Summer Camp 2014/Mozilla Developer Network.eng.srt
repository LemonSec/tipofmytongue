1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:04,790
hello hello

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:13,230
but then I'm inside so then as

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,719
you can see we are talking about md n I am

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,250
cruz

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,220
of the mestre club and also mozilla in the

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,650
sense that I am a more or

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,570
less stable collaborator of mozilla at this point

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,980
today we are talking about mdn by the

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,790
end

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,040
a touch is missing  but it's ok by the end

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,290
of the session the idea would be to be

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,260
able to have an account on mdn and

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,540
have finished your first contribution

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,070
which obviously we can't do from

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,570
here so eventually

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,640
we can make a goal on workshop for those who

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,190
want  to try to collaborate

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,660
mdn what is a wiki and is the central point

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,820
of the mozilla project documentation of the

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,910
technical documentation

21
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,080
intended as documentation of

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,750
everything related to web technologies

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,840
css html javascript firefox os

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,460
everything related to the creation

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,539
of web applications is  desktop than

26
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:17,759
mobile

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,720
because you would like to collaborate on mdn for

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,850
everyone not for you stay for yourself

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,280
for your project for the media

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,250
han them and for the rest of the world

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,290
you can shine getting sex drugs and

32
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,450
rock'n'roll but also no

33
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,650
stickers t-shirts and various things

34
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,939
that mozilla sends her

35
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,180
collaborators from time to time and you can help

36
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,470
the most important thing help the

37
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,750
community to have the  documentation

38
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,960
that musil janie needs all over the

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,450
world just get this

40
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,880
fantastic documentation they will be

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,220
able to contribute in turn and they

42
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,509
will learn to know you and love you

43
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:02,040
sorry but if I don't see them I don't remember

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,440
what point I am still median

45
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,410
is a great platform based  su

46
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,510
man which is the software that is under the

47
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,650
wiki which is written in django and js is not

48
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,350
just a wiki also some little things

49
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,620
for example the fact of being able to write

50
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,780
the translations to a text editor which

51
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,280
for me facilitates the writing of

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,500
translation we will see it later

53
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,050
and to a development team made up of

54
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:37,410
very competent people with me how you

55
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,560
can contribute there are various ways first

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,180
you need to create an a  ccount on

57
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,280
persona people symbol mark that it is

58
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,640
used by

59
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,800
mdn and other mozilla projects for it

60
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,250
is mainly used to reduce

61
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,760
spam

62
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,530
from a certain point to a certain side because

63
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,920
there is the registration step and

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,740
also to be able to know who did what it

65
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,840
is  good than bad in the sense of

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,610
obtaining recognition for their

67
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,680
collaboration but also knowing if

68
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,510
someone has made a stupid type has

69
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,880
filled

70
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,190
the

71
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,930
main page of the html with spam links

72
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,610
once logged in you can

73
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,620
make your changes in the sense that

74
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,310
you can  go and modify the

75
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,930
pages you are interested in modifying you can also

76
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,290
create new ones another thing you

77
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,410
can do to contribute is to report

78
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,810
any correctness or bugs of the

79
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,730
platform on barzilla as for all

80
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,230
mozilla products you can subscribe to the

81
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,400
mdn mailing list that  you can't see it but

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,680
whoever wants to load the hong

83
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,640
the slides on ftp anyway

84
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,420
or you can go and look for help in

85
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,030
irc in the mdn channels  median must mdn

86
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,950
concerns the purely part of

87
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,840
documentation median must concerns the

88
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,320
development of cuma prince you make a

89
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,380
change in the meantime do not be afraid of

90
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,090
doing damage because a wiki and

91
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,340
is historicized you can still go back to a

92
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,290
previous version and unmount that is

93
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,770
undo what you have done  you

94
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,750
really still report a bug at the worst

95
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,410
but it is preferable that people

96
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,090
collaborate in first person and go

97
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:39,020
change what they see here we see we

98
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,240
review the editor interface

99
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,050
that does not look very well but anyway it is a

100
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,150
bit like the bar  of the word tools

101
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,980
is nothing scary in short, underneath

102
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,890
precisely the article you are

103
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,200
editing as you see one is a

104
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,300
visual editor so what you write

105
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,860
you will already see it in the style in which it will appear

106
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,570
on the page

107
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,370
you have controls at the bottom of the page

108
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,830
for reviewing the  review comment

109
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,870
precisely because everything is historicized,

110
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,870
add your tags to

111
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,940
better organize the pages  ine and you can ask for a

112
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,950
technical or editorial review template

113
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,260
no longer exists it has been recently removed

114
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,580
and obviously

115
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,650
put some attachments if you want to

116
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,189
allocate images for example

117
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:27,960
we have the concept of macros which

118
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,689
are small pieces of code like the

119
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:32,879
one you see the html element below

120
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,120
divas that are written in which but scripts

121
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,840
that ultimately javascript and

122
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,300
allow you to avoid

123
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,669
repetitions or to do some things

124
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:46,530
like include a page in another and

125
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,120
other funny things you can

126
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,770
contribute in a big way a little everything

127
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,370
makes soup and it is not  it is necessary that you

128
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,719
constantly translate articles to

129
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:03,300
add content etc.

130
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,650
just a little collaboration a

131
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,690
week and even every small

132
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,699
contribution x all participants

133
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,710
greatly improves the quality of the

134
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,900
documentation small contributions

135
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,819
can be corrections of

136
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:17,069
typing errors technical errors corrections

137
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:18,599
to titles the  announcement but you see them here

138
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,680
you don't need to bind them e  improve the

139
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,590
descriptions all small minutiae

140
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,199
feedback regarding the

141
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,789
slightly larger contributions

142
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,229
writing new articles in this period

143
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:35,029
we are creating a learn section where

144
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,599
we are writing tutorials for those who are

145
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,979
absolutely new to the web and

146
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,449
want to write their first

147
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,669
web page explain what a server is explain

148
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:47,339
the difference between web page server

149
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,319
search engine host etc how

150
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,940
done one rl things like that you can make

151
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,839
technical editorial corrections on

152
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,759
all pages that need it there is a

153
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,949
list of pages there is a  pug on purpose with

154
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:03,330
which the articles that need revision are paid

155
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,919


156
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,569
you can do the translations which is what

157
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:08,099
I started with which seemed like a

158
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,080
crap but

159
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,340
it's a hard job to write demos develop

160
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,960
the platform itself then cuma and

161
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,710
develop tools to help mdn to

162
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,770
create a  new article

163
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,210
mdn works as a tree in the sense that

164
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,759
each page of the sub-pages apart from

165
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,379
some pag  ine details that are the

166
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,949
areas that have no parent

167
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:33,469
so you go to the page

168
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:36,020
you want to create a sub page click

169
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,300
on the gear above and give

170
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,479
new sub-pages and live the

171
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:42,830
new document screen which

172
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,330
in all respects similar to that of

173
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,990
edit the editorial technical review writes it

174
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,940
if you are not sure or

175
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,740
go and ask in the mailing list but it

176
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,680
is better to tag them here and after the screams to the

177
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,120
four winds that's cool I wrote an

178
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,960
article press of n regarding

179
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,539
editorial technical editing is one thing

180
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:04,400
which may require efforts depending

181
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,020
on the size of the page of how

182
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,909
badly written etcetera etcetera

183
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:10,219
in doubt always ask on irc open

184
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:12,469
a bar for i mei ling ask

185
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:15,949
mailinglist however there is always someone

186
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:18,129
who answers me especially in irc

187
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:21,919
you can do the translations just for

188
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,419
do a translation just go

189
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,270
to an article click on languages and

190
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,089
fare ad translation the lis is shown

191
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:30,979
language you can do in

192
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:34,399
which you can do the translation and then

193
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,010
you have on the left the original

194
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,779
English version and on the right the translation you

195
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:44,208
are doing to collaborate on the

196
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,190
translation or create a

197
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,019
localization group ovi units and an existing one

198
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:49,910
in italy already exists mozilla italy

199
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,050
that deals with the translation of

200
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,640
practically all the projects that have

201
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,980
to do with mozilla have recently

202
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,949
finished the translation of the interface of mdn a couple of months ago

203
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:02,779
or

204
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,720
you can write about the edema that are

205
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,540
small programs with which they demonstrated

206
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,550
a technology  web

207
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,899
what do I know a little game written with

208
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:19,010
html5 canvas with webgl a very

209
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,420
impressive thing that was done a few

210
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,279
months ago was the porting of

211
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,240
the andria the engine in javascript via asma js and it

212
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,269
works well at 30 frames per second

213
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:30,709
quietly on a  browser i.e. on

214
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:35,029
firefox you can put these demos on

215
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:38,209
github send them directly to

216
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,040
the demo section of m of an or send

217
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,589
a link oppu  re you can create her

218
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:44,930
samples which are small pieces

219
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,490
of code that you put inside an

220
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,100
article of mdn that do something with

221
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,390
me that I know you have to demonstrate that a

222
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,820
certain technology works in a given module

223
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,100
with given code and you can have the demo

224
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,740
directly in the  page you can create

225
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,899
tools a demo that does

226
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:06,370
something useful or the box shadow generator that

227
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,610
a small application that makes the shadow

228
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,740
around the rectangles to see

229
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,720
how the box shadow or

230
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,250
css property works

231
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,680
you can write macros that are the

232
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,940
ones we have seen before  they are

233
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,490
written in which but scripts that javascript

234
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,579
with a few more apps that

235
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:27,440
run on the server side for that there is a

236
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,589
dependency on moby js but you cannot

237
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,720
do client side games such as

238
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,660
animations and such or you can

239
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,790
contribute to cuma if you like python

240
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,020
precisely with django

241
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,870
that is through django you can develop

242
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,080
cuma you download from gi tab you put on an

243
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,470
environment through va vagrant that creates a

244
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,810
virtu  at the machine in which it runs you have

245
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,980
the development environment ready in

246
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,090
half an hour do you realize is the beauty of

247
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,620
mozilla however that we are a large

248
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,800
community and you do not have to do everything alone

249
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,260
there are people there are thousands of people

250
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,540
who share yours  interests there are

251
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,400
35 thousand people currently

252
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,460
collaborating with mdn in various

253
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,600
collaborative forms ask for help in irc email

254
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,310
in short we are always there basically

255
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,590
you can recycle content you can

256
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,030
recycle an old your old

257
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,640
blog post an article code

258
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,400
example a mozilla ax post but  what

259
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,090
I know you will not do it and take

260
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,340
everything you have written on the web

261
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,070
about the web and put it on mdn

262
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,800
obviously your content not

263
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,200
that of others as has been done

264
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,820
recently I have concluded that she did

265
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,360
that cool

266
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,840
anyway if there are questions or  if you want to

267
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,910
see for a moment how it works live

268
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,970
we are at the stand of the

269
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,000
maestra club club near the bar

270
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,380
there are questions in the meantime I would say no just

271
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,950
for  because you asked me

272
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,560
yes of course

273
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,939
then

274
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:19,529
oh well it's basically last summer

275
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:24,079
the hm there was shut

276
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,949
up last week it is the week

277
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:32,100
last year the hm in the netherlands there were

278
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,149
various workshops held by

279
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:39,689
various characters  of mozilla including to the spivak who

280
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:43,350
is the project manager of mdn and nothing I

281
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,410
started to collaborate making

282
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,850
random corrections around mdn

283
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,169
then I started to do the translations

284
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:52,230
those guys from mozilla italy and then

285
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,589
participating in the biweekly meetings

286
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:57,809
that are there  in irc every wednesday

287
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:00,059
at 7 we start to take a bit of the

288
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,040
pulse of the situation to come and see

289
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,799
how the project is managed how

290
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,239
the objectives are decided and what of the

291
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:08,069
kind we subscribe to the mailing list and there

292
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:10,949
is a fairly light flow of

293
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:14,699
information to  respect and we take

294
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:16,889
a little hand we begin to write to

295
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:18,660
help propose ourselves for certain

296
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,980
tasks also to help

297
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,230
newcomers now there is me and an

298
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,519
Indian boy who are  collaborating

299
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,699
enough on this part of the

300
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:33,738
glossary of md n

301
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:38,809
thanks to all
