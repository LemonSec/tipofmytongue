1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:10,260
sbiriguda well there we are ok well hello

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,340
everyone i am ayas and i will tell you a little about

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,050
this nice nice little thing that the z sh is

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,770
first used mac

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,350
i'm sorry the flame maybe we do it

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,949
later during the questions then the

7
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,960
booking will be very axor z is all

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,070
in a row when which you see well then

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,489
let's start

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,380
I'm sorry you don't see what I'm

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,360
writing here because it is

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,180
also interesting that then so-called sh in the

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,579
sacred a shell like how its

14
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,000
name derives it derives slash is very similar

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,199
to ksh even if to many many  things of

16
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,270
low also supports the emulation of

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,739
bach sh and also csh up to a certain

18
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,320
point things let's say the points in favor

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,188
are a very powerful blob in

20
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,659
you all know what a globe ying is sorry

21
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,430
every now and then ask a few questions

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,850
ok but  what I can say

23
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,740
at the beginning is that this is done here if

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,670
talking about a shell

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,110
but if the inter activates the

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,520
presentation will also be

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,560


28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,740
interactive.  ture

29
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,119
lobbying is the way of generating

30
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,820
filenames by replacing

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,829
strings practically so I is

32
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:34,020
what allows me to do for example

33
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,470
ls3 asterisk and lsd 3 curiosities makes me

34
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,340
said here and there outline del poc baidu is

35
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,009
this here i globe in  replacement

36
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:47,159
file name expansion

37
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,630
lobbying is much more powerful than

38
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,509
what you can find instead it invests a lot

39
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,040
and very simple

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,960
we will see a little later with renzi

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,460
cartografica to cinematographic it

42
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,350
means that if I do gray instead

43
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,210
of greek and mix asks me  if I want to

44
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,759
correct it it is only correct it obviously

45
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,639
comes to the error advanced editing it is

46
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,919
the line editor that this

47
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,720
subroutine that allows me to

48
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,060
write text let's say is extensible

49
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,220
through a series of mechanisms then there

50
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,900
is then among the three nice things

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,610
also lenin  directories that are

52
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,610
practically directories that

53
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,100
are associated with a name for example I can

54
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,120
do this here is an amen director of

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,440
there is a  break that I saved

56
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,750
at the beginning of mine in my

57
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,019
initialization writings and now I can quote

58
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:42,209
directly and this however as you can

59
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:45,900
see is a whole series of

60
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:54,000
long directors ok then let's talk a bit of

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,220
history very briefly it was created in

62
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,350
1990 so it is not a  new thing

63
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,910
so much so that now we have version

64
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,360
5.0 point you just came out usually

65
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,400
pay attention especially for debian

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,739
has ri because the package on stable and it

67
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,400
seems to me it is 4.0.4 point 3.7 mi for

68
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,440
something like that rather old old

69
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,769
text  it was named the sh

70
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:22,049
in honor of the professor of this polfa

71
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:24,060
all star which is the one it was created that

72
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,030
had a user name and razete to

73
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,950
itself h point is thought it was given a

74
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,970
very good name for for a shell syntax

75
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,609
then syntax like  as you can see

76
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:37,140
beautiful in the commands at the beginning it is very

77
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,040
similar to beck

78
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,310
indeed practically identical loeb the team

79
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,109
are always that we always have out

80
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:44,700
etcetera etcetera with the syntax

81
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,400
practically  te identical with the difference

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,660
that however it supports real arrays that is not

83
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,040
so from a bit weird of beige if

84
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,220
someone would like instead it is something a bit

85
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,090
so it seems a bit ca ta we say no

86
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,370
while you put sakaar to the real ones

87
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,200
that is separate precisely with well separators

88
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,920
defined and undefined with spaces and things and also

89
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,480
multidimensional rai and also to

90
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,239
associative rays hagyari associative so

91
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,228
I can define myself all for all for

92
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:18,918
all your array needs let's

93
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:21,358
also say expansionist together the parameters

94
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,980
expansions both from

95
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,300
let's say normal expansions and

96
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,890
expansion of parameters that is the

97
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,590
trivial one  this thing here that you

98
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:43,710
usually put between for example maybe ok ok ok

99
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,050


100
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:52,080
great ok ok this thing

101
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,760
shouldn't happen but it is hopefully

102
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:01,260
later ok then we're done for

103
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,010
this yes ok now I think I have the data

104
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,870
a good overview of things  that you can

105
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,740
make this choice

106
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,500
we can we can try to go a little

107
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,400
deeper

108
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,540
then let's talk about globe in lobbying

109
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,730
we have  or already said what is all the

110
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,740
basic globes that is those of bosch are

111
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,590
supported so asterisk substitutions

112
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,660
of characters between the brackets between the

113
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,270
square brackets etc. etc. are

114
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,460
supported in addition to this beautiful

115
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,640
thing that is the recursive globe and this

116
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,410
thing here can  turn into a

117
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,060
replacement for the find command then

118
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,090
find you can dream veil because for

119
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,070
example here I have my folders

120
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,960
you have seen them before they

121
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,620
are done so I can make a list

122
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,540
for example so it is

123
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,160
I want to see all the files in all the

124
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,660
folders recursively ending

125
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,360
for txt and this is the list of all the

126
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,650
files so it also makes a traverse then

127
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,110
a character class and so this I don't know in

128
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,000
truth I don't know if it has it even low

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,420
maybe yes the character classes with the

130
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,150
name let's say it should also have them with

131
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,860
two points alpha 2 points here is what

132
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,990
has it maybe has it also to them

133
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,240
and then there are all the various

134
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,830
extended globes that is negations pattern

135
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,000
repetitions of patterns

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,740
and others  things that I will show you that are

137
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,210
really a lot not here but here

138
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,570
then it is a bit if we see them then

139
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,050
this extended globe is a

140
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,450
shell option that it seems that the action of 6 cm

141
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,760
even low if I'm not mistaken is something to be

142
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,290
set let's say  at the beginning that modifies

143
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,670
the way in which the same h operates

144
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,460
here is this here for example it is the

145
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,780
negation so with the dear gareth

146
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,210
at the beginning it makes you the negation not only

147
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,750
you can kiss a pattern and then all

148
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,690
that is not but there  another pattern

149
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,840
or this version here

150
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,180
that does everything but everything of the first

151
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,680
pattern but not what I do to the

152
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,510
second patten while these you see

153
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,870
later are the multipliers let's say of the

154
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:27,040
pattern so 0 plus one or more ok then

155
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,870
another nice thing are the globes  which

156
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,450
fires these if you use a lot if you use a

157
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,770
lot left they are really very

158
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,530
powerful and practically should be put in

159
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,570
brackets takes teams after the pattern

160
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,970
and allow you to select the type

161
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,490
of file you want to see that is then

162
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,660
sc  heere between fa the normal director in

163
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,400
land pipe symlink there is between

164
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,299
etc. let's take an example

165
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,500
this is mine my

166
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,050
configuration file folder

167
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,940
there is a lot of stuff a lot of aliases

168
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,250
etc. etc. well I can do

169
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,530
all of them  the recursive folders that

170
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,360
contain a file that is a

171
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,580
symbolic link and these are all the

172
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,010
symbolic links in mine there are many

173
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,740
because I use 1 very nice script at home

174
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,080
that allows you to

175
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,630
automatic filing and allows you to have symbolic links

176
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,110


177
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,330
let's say a mess  inside a

178
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,160
folder I will train it and then the

179
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,520
rest

180
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,500
for example maybe I might be

181
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,940
interested in the normal files that are

182
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,799
symbolized by the dot in this case

183
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,399
and are a little less

184
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,479
ok the wolf the files are in here

185
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,828
there are really some  many as you can

186
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:45,829
see neither in pipe but not only even if it is

187
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:49,339
writable or readable by the world or

188
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:51,589
by any user we can

189
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:55,010
also specify the user who is

190
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,860
selected let's say I would use them of we

191
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,079
the time of modes modification

192
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:05,000
time the access time other things there

193
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,740
are really a lot of them so much so that I

194
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,660
don't remember all of them because I don't have

195
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,199
to use them but there are really every

196
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:13,699
now and then I have to check that

197
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:15,290
famous pdf file that  among other things

198
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,760
you find on the site of the tese it happens

199
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,320
very very well done

200
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,420
you remember acate done that way there

201
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,800
al is in short well we are talking about alias

202
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,930
alias seems to be a fairly trivial thing

203
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,300


204
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,220
in truth in addition to the students their ills

205
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,430
other two types of aliases that  it is

206
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,560
global aliases which are the most

207
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,050
dangerous thing ever and allow you

208
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,170
to define an alias which is expanded

209
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,880
no matter where you put it in the

210
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,329
command line

211
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:46,130
so it doesn't put it in the middle of the mind

212
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,529
all over the banks this thing is

213
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,449
very very nice with  you that I will

214
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:55,100
show you my least g

215
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,690
practically wet the first one that maybe

216
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,880
a little published but greg headless

217
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,980
without writing the piper we obviously

218
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,899
are very lazy and so  i writes a

219
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,760
capital letter and he spreads

220
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,350
very well these see the rest are

221
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,420
expanded obviously they are not

222
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,130
put inside a word but only

223
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,810
if they are hoped for by the space on

224
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,510
both sides and then there are also the allies

225
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,790
suffix that is the way  in which I am

226
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,829
making the slides I am showing the

227
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,640
slides practically allow you to are

228
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,029
these allow you for example tex

229
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,829
equal vim means that all

230
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:32,389
files ending with tex if I write them

231
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:33,920
directly on the command line without

232
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,870
specifying a parameter at the beginning

233
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,880
mediapro in b

234
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,649
similarly here so with a lot

235
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:40,850
of text files and I put my

236
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,440
beautiful alias that every time I open

237
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,819
a text file makes me clear and cut ok

238
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:48,860
these are very very useful aliases

239
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,170
and here we are laughing a little  al

240
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:51,860
juice

241
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,570
now i hope i started a little

242
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,050
late so well tab completion is

243
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,170
the most powerful thing inside a

244
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,430
shell of bach and z sh sorry because

245
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,100
because i am  or based on let's say two

246
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,480
systems at the beginning there was the

247
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,120
qom ctl system which is based on precisely calls

248
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,270
to this with ctl that a utility this

249
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,590
when I use it practically no one is

250
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,180
left alone as deco the compatibility

251
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,730
in a comsys system and the  completely

252
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,390
based on shell functions

253
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,570
functions normal functions we say practically

254
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,220
default is associated with the name

255
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,430
of the executable we make an example port

256
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,550
that the package manager snack port

257
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,500
for the complement for the

258
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,330
full port is called the function

259
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,850
underscore sport is this by default

260
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,770
we see  a little what's in here

261
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,810
then don't be scared there will be an

262
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,520
avalanche of stuff that I hope is quite

263
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,830
visible the first line there is comme des

264
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:04,380
sports that I specify it is clear it

265
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,310
will not go away

266
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:23,250
help me almost dark and obviously contrary

267
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:30,300
dark no in white  a no it was not bright

268
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:38,490
and high light yes cheat up better ok

269
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,770
this is a sim disclaimer this

270
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,870
when I wrote it important

271
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,230
let's see a bit in action  at first door

272
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,760
we write the beautiful command and

273
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,330
problem otab pack what opens me an

274
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,850
interactive menu with all the sub commands of

275
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,130
port with the relative description on the side

276
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,900
I hope you see something

277
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,310
these are all things that can be

278
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,800
fully controlled and not only

279
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,770
obviously then if  I did it that

280
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,160
all evil with the ls I do stops

281
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,240
another c is one a line makes me all the

282
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,340
commands all the options let's say but not

283
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,680
only for example happy is a command

284
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,910
that makes me see all the files that are

285
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,350
inside  of a package obviously is

286
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,120
valid only for the packages that are

287
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,430
installed with a tab he completes

288
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,500
all the packages that are installed and

289
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,840
not and not all the packages at all

290
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,710
but if I do an install for example

291
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,030
he will complete all the packages for me the

292
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,880
first time  it takes a long time

293
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,560
but for all the consequent calls

294
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,190
a caching system is implemented

295
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,350
a caching system is rewarded that

296
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,680
allows you to complete it in a way that

297
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,700
m  I hear much faster

298
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,440
obviously all this the

299
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,780
caching system is supported let's say from

300
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,090
these widgets that are functions that

301
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,580
come that are called by the

302
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,650
completion system so let's get back to

303
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,910
us this here is the hope you see this

304
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,290
here is the main function here  there are

305
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,520
all the actions

306
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,560
unfortunately it is very ugly to see because

307
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,560
in this way the spaces and vain skype

308
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,880
ati with as flash

309
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,890
here we are here are all under commands

310
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,200
here this is a widget that

311
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,820
is very often used is

312
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,020
you see it here in arguments it is this  here it is

313
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,370
always a function of the

314
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,540
shell functions so much so that even its

315
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:36,920
documentation axes among other things it de sa

316
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,230
that it is one of the few shells that to the

317
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,850
documentation so complex that it is

318
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,550
carried out in ten different but home pages

319
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,190
ok

320
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,510
this is the let's say man  page this

321
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,850
here is a normal is a normal

322
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,560
shell function with its parameters with its

323
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,300
with its things this is one of the most

324
00:14:59,300 --> 00:14:59,840
complicated

325
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,420
so much so that the d  The documentation is pretty

326
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,620
long as you can see in essence it

327
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,790
allows you to automatically complete

328
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,060
both the options as you can see here

329
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,400
and then the actions that are this line

330
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,980
here brings actions that tells me about the

331
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,590
first number 1 and about the first

332
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,190
position

333
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,530
immediately after the command let's say complete

334
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,630
the actions and for everything else he calls

335
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,290
this other function which, although of a species

336
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,769
which on the basis of the under command then

337
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,139
completes forward we say no, this is

338
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,850
practically a kind of cascade

339
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,489
that forms where we say the first

340
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:39,279
the more generic one the capture and then the

341
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,110
send to those that if not much more

342
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,670
specialized gradually this is a type

343
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,069
of organizing them let's say

344
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,230
and all this system all this

345
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,970
all these complexes cannot

346
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,509
be configured with zetas files

347
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:56,769
textiles are really

348
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,569
really interesting little things that beyond the

349
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:01,959
complex are not a bit  things or more

350
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:05,319
exotic that you go slip a little

351
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:08,290
away from the best let's say z spies is

352
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,149
practically a k  ey value storage for

353
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:12,489
settings and it goes

354
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:14,170
any way pretty much to high z

355
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,939
spies that has a function doesn't have a

356
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:19,540
build in that you mainly need to

357
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,199
pull to enter pull out

358
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,049
configurations syntax and pattern

359
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:28,329
style and strings this whole thing

360
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:30,549
comes to you  it can then be extended by the user

361
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:32,110
so much so that I can invent my

362
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,350
styles my patten and then call z

363
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,899
shoulders I pull out the pattern I want to

364
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:44,920
say yes practically the pattern is the

365
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,420
central part that specifies me because

366
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,040
practically the context in which it is

367
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,160
style is valid and this is a bit complicated

368
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,459
to understand that is it takes maybe it takes to

369
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:56,980
read the manual a bit I'll

370
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,879
show you an example

371
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,609
this is an example in which it does not

372
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:12,869
complete well here we are

373
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,369
now comes the ethnic background

374
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,730
well then as you can see here there are

375
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,560
several  with z style

376
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,200
what you see between the quotes the

377
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,170
pattern and what you see computer in

378
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,580
this case is the and the style is what

379
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,890
I have then let's say I know  no the values the first

380
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,200
this line here the first line tells me

381
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,090
that in all the completion pattern

382
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,190
practically the computers that are the

383
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,870
functions that are called in order

384
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,750
to complete the current word are e

385
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,920
xpand complete proxima it id us nord

386
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,230
correct approximate many prefix  history

387
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,120
practically these are all

388
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,320
sub-functions that are part of

389
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,000
the completion suite the first one

390
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,970
expands me all the expandability is

391
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,950
shell variable also commands let's say

392
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,610
those with dollar brackets to understand

393
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,780
cetera complete calls the

394
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,170
completion function of the

395
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,310
approximate command is one thing  very nice that

396
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,860
allows you to correct correct

397
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,770
errors correct is a very similar

398
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,020
approximate approximate many is another

399
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,000
thing that practically because

400
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,610
practically these are configurable

401
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,100
the proxima so that at the beginning it

402
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,750
replaces me only one character or

403
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,850
adds one removes one  then

404
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,620
corrects it if by chance you have been

405
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,000
some typos  and then it

406
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,030
substitutes more prefixes and history are

407
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,280
are other things let's say and these are

408
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,130
how you can practically see grains

409
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,010
value the key thing here that the

410
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,810
patterns and are eaten are

411
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,490
machaty as if they were thrown on

412
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,980
a string let's say what is more

413
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,750
specific  it is worth more obviously no

414
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,550
so at the beginning allow one that

415
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,350
is valid for all and then gradually for

416
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,420
each case then then selected then

417
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,130
select your thing we have ok

418
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,010
still the other little thing quite

419
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,710
body and I go towards the conclusion

420
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,159
the modules the modules are  practically

421
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:25,169
pieces of compiled code but just

422
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:28,590
like library dynamics that can

423
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,390
be included are called from

424
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,440
the shell cor

425
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,360
this is let's say to separate the little

426
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,830
things that can be interesting

427
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,350
but maybe not always they do not always

428
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,640
mean all of interest to

429
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,940
lighten the shell core a little

430
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,289
some some interesting modules are

431
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:45,870
the pcr which allows you to do

432
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,730
for the compatible rego  the rics press not

433
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,990
directly from the shell so I can

434
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,299
compile and call them as I want

435
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,789
but funk that practically

436
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:55,130
all the trigonometric math functions

437
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,270
various things directly

438
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,830
from the shell and then I can do

439
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,250
expansions nicolò activated on this

440
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,820
these are arithmetic expansions

441
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,940
miccoli sky activated on this we see

442
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,600
less not if activated

443
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:23,940
we see here obviously it takes michael

444
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,440
ahead and this allows him to

445
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,820
calculate directly to use

446
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,860
even a little advanced functions nor in the

447
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,529
shell this goes hand in hand with

448
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:36,240
finding hand in hand with must cult z

449
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,159
call that a calculator  integrated

450
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,909
in the shell which is practically a

451
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:42,930


452
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,730
don't know everything about bike let's say no it

453
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,050
allows me to do calculations

454
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,760
obviously if you tame it funk I

455
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,740
allow myself to do even more

456
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,510
complex calculations let's say st de ftp yes also

457
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,060
klein steven klein types integrated the

458
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,970
shell then  he did not say are really

459
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,650
absurd things but file and also very

460
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,840
interesting not  only you know map file

461
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,820
allows you to map all the files that

462
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,530
if not the current directory in

463
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,930
an associative rai and you can read

464
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,460
from the files by reading from the

465
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,990
let's say variable and not only then also use the

466
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,490
ride which is a command that allows you to

467
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,410
modify in the  your favorite editor a

468
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,690
variable and you go to edit files then

469
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:26,730
at the end and then there is last known tsl that

470
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,650
the of the century in editor which is

471
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,070
precisely what you need to write let's say is the

472
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,380
one is praised by default

473
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,840
ok starting to finish

474
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,460
there are  also a couple of things a couple of

475
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,020
little things that are let's say interesting lai

476
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,500
ore direction that really very

477
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,340
powerful and very messed up practically

478
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,140
by default swap with all

479
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,610
normal operators say direction then major

480
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,560
minor

481
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,660
etcetera etc has a shell

482
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,760
option called claber that  it allows you

483
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,520
to save your files if by chance the

484
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,230
trunks because with only one you know that it

485
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,570
truncates instead if you do a robert with

486
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,930
only one anti tank loved by error  and how do

487
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,220
you cut the siff to no global

488
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,350
there is

489
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,330
a special command which is that

490
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,860
exclamation point after it is that of trumpet in

491
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,200
any case then there are the tir doc and share

492
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,470
string as in as below if I

493
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,220
'm not mistaken

494
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,910
then with  22 minors and then the steaua f

495
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,660
then text and f

496
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,650
there is also a nice little thing that

497
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,679
allows you to address standard input and

498
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,090
standard errors to a file directly

499
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,890
without double without

500
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,830
double the right let's say and then it does

501
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,179
even if substitution that  it's a

502
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:42,830
very nice thing and it allows you

503
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,400
practically to treat a treat a

504
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,770
re direction from a command that is

505
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,000
executed there is from a saab sel

506
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,640
practically now we speak perhaps a little

507
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,650
complicated because you can follow me

508
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,090
all my stops if you do not understand

509
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,299
something

510
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,620
obviously  this thing here its

511
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,880
problems because the

512
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,409
synchronization sopranos do not know how

513
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:05,059
when especially because there is another

514
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,730
option that is the multi multi or that

515
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,289
practically allows you to make networks

516
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:11,299
multiple that is I can revise

517
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:13,370
the standard input without networks on two on two different files

518
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,280
without using other stuff

519
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,650
this mind is a bit dangerous

520
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,520
because of seeing a bit of

521
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,570
synchronization as being put ok

522
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,669
[ __ ] automatic and what you have

523
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:29,150
already seen before is there  a widget that who

524
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,340
corrects errors configurable all

525
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,610
with age styles obviously and then there is

526
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,200
also his little brother approximate that

527
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,909
adds characters practically the

528
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:39,530
difference between correct approximate and

529
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,780
that to proxima also adds characters

530
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,690
while correct

531
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,210
only there replaces them only

532
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,250
obviously then combine  the two then

533
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,169
do first correct then approximate

534
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,840
end they wear the expansions the

535
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,419
expansions are all the things of the

536
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:00,039
banana the expansion of of the history

537
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,809
let's say of the previous commands that type

538
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:02,710
exclamation point

539
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,860
and this is also at the bottom obviously

540
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,210
what there is also  at the bottom I am not mistaken is

541
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,070
the exclamation point by selecting also

542
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,600
the parameters of the

543
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,909
previous command quin  of this all is

544
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,960
well supported

545
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,570
all the various expansions are also supported by some between

546
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,100
the braces that is expansions

547
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,200
of the variables let's see if

548
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,779
I show you a few examples

549
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:32,759
then let's see a little then

550
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:41,360
here they are this ok these are all

551
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,920
those that maybe  one can be

552
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,230
used to it, that is, it removes a pattern

553
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,610
from the end, it removes a pattern

554
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,210
from the beginning, but this too I don't know if

555
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,170
there is a batch to replace everything

556
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,070
one pattern with another one but between

557
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:01,390
string yes, this is certainly not

558
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,490
beautiful  the choice of words

559
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,550
like les scelles type bar that does not know how to

560
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:11,540
use harley and sorry these things

561
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,890
here that allows you to do glo bing

562
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,450
expansions even in new rehabilitate

563
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,660
then there are these the parameter flags that

564
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,130
allows you to do interesting things

565
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,670
with the variable  type capital eyes all

566
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,340
in aprica institute in lauer that join

567
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,520
ray's splitter race

568
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,420
all these things that are not really a

569
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,310
lot unfortunately we don't have time

570
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,200
to go on go through all

571
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,640
are really all interesting and

572
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,980
nothing this is let's say a word not

573
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,080
I have tried a bit to convince life

574
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,370
to show you a bit of so

575
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,530
interesting in the sh and with this

576
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,030
defined I am open to your questions

577
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:54,410
and I guess there  let them be some and thank you

578
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:58,490
for having listened and it passes for de s

579
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,490
convert yourselves
