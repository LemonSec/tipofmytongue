1
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,070
ok hello everyone i am ma i'm gpl big

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,219
shot we have as special guest guido

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,570
bolognesi di zen who wanted us

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,740
instead of who we asked to

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,150
tell us about his experience with

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,110
trick 8 and then maybe he also tells us

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,080
a bit how he built and we are  remained

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,689
at last year's talk for who was there

9
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,309
I don't know if you remember it or if you saw

10
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:35,960
on youtube how not to build a

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,430
quadcopter last year we didn't have

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,039
a working quadcopter yet

13
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,260
the good news is that this year

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,399
we have it

15
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,819
after that talk finally

16
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:51,129
the propellers we had ordered arrived

17
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,819
someone remembers practically we

18
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,280
bought the tv before the material we had

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,800
bought only four propellers obviously

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,690
just finished assembling it first thing

21
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,399
he did he overturned and broke a

22
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,629
propeller so they could stay me

23
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,180
external one month to wait for the propellers

24
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,670
9 from china but now we have a

25
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,190
box full of propellers so not the

26
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,730
problem does not exist so remember

27
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,320
if you do a  quadcopter to take more

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,470
than four propellers at a time well after

29
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,980
lesc the first suggestion after les that

30
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,390
we had made a quadcopter

31
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,720
with the multi this card here we had

32
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,980
said to eliminate it is called the

33
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,690
kkk but managed to make it work even

34
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,340
if the one with the display we  we had the one

35
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,470
without display in our defense and

36
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,350
we chose the multi wii because it

37
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,030
was a little more complex a little more

38
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,630
complete it had all the

39
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,440
real-time information of the

40
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,420
quadcopter you could see the

41
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,150
status of the sensors and the whole

42
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,830
configuration is represented in one

43
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,730
which very nice they asked for a bus

44
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,190
of engines and therefore already with the

45
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,610
ground quadcopter you could understand more or less if

46
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,959
when we turned it on it would

47
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,850
overturn and that is a great step forward

48
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,400
so as soon as we finished assembling the

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,670
quadcopter

50
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,829
here we were already with this frame this

51
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:30,260
here is the wood trend that we

52
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,840
made we went from an

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,189
aluminum frame which was the first that not

54
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,739
it was fine because the arms twisted to

55
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:41,239
a frame in sheet metal tubes like those

56
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,909
of the camping tents but that

57
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:45,769
was very good and it was very light

58
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,689
but when it fell they bent and

59
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:51,260
knew and we decided to switch to

60
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,420
wood because it is very easy to

61
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,540
work  blasphemy if it falls it breaks it costs

62
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,230
very little not very little because it is very

63
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,370
flexible and does not transmit vibrations it

64
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,989
performs very well the vibrations of the

65
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,060
engines

66
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,989
and it is very easy to work and cheap

67
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:15,959
so super excited and happy to

68
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,630
have a working quadcopter

69
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,040
we started to do the first  tests

70
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,700
with go pro and video from above

71
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,610
and the first problem arose it is nice to make

72
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,580
the quadcopter go up

73
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,930
there at the bottom there are the mountains then it

74
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,630
turns and then I was at the shutter that

75
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,690
explains it to us big shot who is a photographer

76
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,739
actually I don't know how to explain it to you very well

77
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,140
I can only tell you that if I remember correctly it

78
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,140
depends on how the

79
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,560
sensor of a room is managed and

80
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,510
some strips are taken  sce at a time so if

81
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,370
based on the frequency of this I was

82
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,290
in

83
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,910
the inter the frequency of rotation of the blades to

84
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,620
the effects and imaginative

85
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,790
ok here we are flying we started

86
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,220
from here we were at the bottom when

87
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,210
we started and here we had already lost

88
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,180
sight  the quadcopter and I'm trying to

89
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,890
get him back home with little success

90
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,380
because they didn't see him I could no longer

91
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,560
find him here there is venice among other things

92
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,840
we are this euro where I live more or less

93
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,380
forty minutes by train from venice and

94
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,790
therefore here we have lost quadcopter

95
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,370
obviously the commands of the quadcopter

96
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,740
respond with respect to the nose of the

97
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,960
quadcopter so as soon as it turns

98
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,240
a bit if you have no eye contact and does not

99
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,479
know which way to turn the commands go

100
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,550
backwards at a certain point I decided

101
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,889
to turn off the engines and luckily let it fall

102
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,530
into the  fall

103
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,110
we appeared noticed he saw it fall

104
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,110
and we saw what had happened and then

105
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:26,590
we were able to fish it out and go and

106
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,870
retrieve it after seven minutes of

107
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,320
walk

108
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:39,340
ok damage few

109
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,590
actually did not suffer major

110
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,190
damage success had broken an

111
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,580
engine support that are made of aluminum

112
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,000
the arms were completely internal

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,370
the support of the go

114
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,319
pro was slightly broken but nothing serious

115
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,880
we did an account from the height

116
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,380
we  measured the time it

117
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,509
took to fall in theory it was more or

118
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:05,289
less 100 meters and in fact this here is

119
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:07,030
the same frame that happened and there is

120
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,979
practically nothing at all the frame

121
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,229
itself electronics no problem the

122
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:12,940
battery has hit hard and it is

123
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,150
inflated and we could take it to

124
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,620
blow up analysts but we

125
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,210
forgot and broke two propellers the first

126
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,650
two propellers not even serious after

127
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,270
this experience

128
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,340
we thought it best to inform us for a

129
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,169
moment what is generally done in these

130
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:35,710
cases there is a function called fail

131
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,909
safe which  usually it activates when it

132
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:42,400
is turned off when the helicopter no

133
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,680
longer receives commands in this

134
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,229
function generally can be programmed  ata for

135
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,780
example in this case to make it

136
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,639
land then by the little

137
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,389
accelerators so that slowly terry alone is

138
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:58,500
possible instead with buying a gps

139
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,880
put a 66 a bit of complex that

140
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,810
brings the quadcopter back home

141
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,400
automatically when it loses

142
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,620
the remote control signal

143
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,690
so we have  rightly decided to buy a gps

144
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,250
there are different brands of

145
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,870
gps

146
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,910
the cheapest ones are not enough there are the media

147
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,130
techs that are the first that it is not that they

148
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,530
were used because I blocks that

149
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,910
were still a lot

150
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,340
now instead the blocks are for 10

151
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,660
15 euros so  and it is better to buy

152
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,310
those and they are the best

153
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,780
and finally there is the alternative of the k networks the

154
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,840
k networks is a gps a little more complex

155
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,610
in the sense that there is a gps on board the

156
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,460
Quadri Cotter a gps at the base at the

157
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,220
station where where  the quadcopter is launched, they

158
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,820
communicate via radio and

159
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,860
information is exchanged on the difference

160
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,860
in position with respect to the

161
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,810
fixed station and the

162
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,120
moving object and with  This technology needed the

163
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,200
accuracy of 45 centimeters maximum

164
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,150
error is the cheapest commercial

165
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,520
costs about 1,000 euros and also open source

166
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,500
and among other things, however, there are modules

167
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,700
that have recently come out of this

168
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,220
for 25 euros each, therefore with two  modules is

169
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,800
a radio module among the transceivers

170
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,020
in theory it is possible to do something by

171
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,300
spending little we see if the

172
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,099
open source community decides to commit itself from

173
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:33,450
this point of view and develop

174
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,769
something they will certainly contribute

175
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:43,229
so we have the multi wibro after a while it

176
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:45,000
began to stay tight we  decided

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,890
that we wanted something more and then

178
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,300
we took lardo pilot arru pilot

179
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:58,529
this ticket here is the most used it is

180
00:08:58,529 --> 00:08:59,970
practically the most widespread ticket the

181
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,250
most widespread autopilot among all of

182
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,990
them and it is always an open

183
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:12,779
source project born from 3dr robotics that is

184
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,760
committed  to develop it is this here is

185
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,670
the second version

186
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,010
now the version is available

187
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,220
always mounts a micro based on arduino there is a

188
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,510
nati meg  a

189
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,660
cortex m4 based version has recently come out which is

190
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,829
called px 4px hoc which is a tronic

191
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:39,089
developed by the university of switzerland

192
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:42,300
something like this is even more

193
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,970
recently

194
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,639
andrew tridgell who is one of the main

195
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,439
hardware developers of this

196
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:52,160
announced project who are  working

197
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,129
on a kate on board for the beagle

198
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:58,279
bonn and then using the

199
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,009
linux-based bi golborne system insists to make

200
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:04,790
the autopilot announced that there was the

201
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,990
first flight of a drone let's call it so

202
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,329
indeed for all intents and purposes hall with

203
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:15,050
based on  bigon black and at an

204
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,959
amateur level first based on linux then

205
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:22,120
ok

206
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,860
among the interesting things that

207
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,370
lardo pilot can do is the programming of

208
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,040
waypoints so you can program

209
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,139
a whole series of way points to make

210
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:34,970
the drone go which is now a

211
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,689
drone because then  it will have autonomously you

212
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:40,310
can make it run paths you can

213
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:44,000
specify an area a rectangle a

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,079
polygon on the map to be scanned and the

215
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:52,819
program the software  of flight labase

216
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,209
station that I do not have in which installed is

217
00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:00,220
the bay station calculates in a

218
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,899
cancer range all the path you need to do

219
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,879
to take the photos from above

220
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,350
all that area to map the photo

221
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,100
with the photos like google earth

222
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,180
there is  a very interesting telemetry

223
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,920
in the sense that by buying telemetry modules it

224
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,079
is also possible via

225
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,559
telephone with a usl cable or tg usb otg

226
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,389
connect the radio receiver 403 meyers

227
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:29,059
and have the information in real time

228
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:31,910
on the phone you can drive the phone drone by

229
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,649
telling it  pressing a point

230
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:35,150
on the map

231
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,330
and and sending sky there is another

232
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,330
interesting function that linz of tracking

233
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,950
so we have our gps on the

234
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:49,490
phone and the drone follows us and beyond the

235
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,820
telemetry on the model soldier this

236
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,680
here is the first we did then

237
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,810
we did  another later and

238
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,850
we also put in we used on

239
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,370
this an open source

240
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:07,460
rs remote is always 430 mega hertz and this is

241
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,600
a remote  penn source

242
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,210
always developed by the community of 3d

243
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:19,820
robotics and and this is a remote control

244
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,570
that has a transceiver module

245
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,890
that also allows you to integrate

246
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,130
telemetry and has a range that can

247
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,900
reach up to tens of kilometers

248
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,210
with good antennas and beyond that

249
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,430
on the other drone we also put

250
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,200
the camera for the pv axis with a

251
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,990
normal 5 8 gb transceiver that

252
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,120
you will find that you can easily find on the

253
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,100
internet

254
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,210
so we have made in addition to this

255
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,160
another quadcopter that I do not have here but

256
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,890
in short at home because unfortunately yes

257
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,470
crashed the other day a month ago more

258
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,720
or less and not that all a bit of

259
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,870
repair and that crashed because

260
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,690
a motor cable was disconnected and

261
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,300
then in flight

262
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,010
that quadcopter overturned there before

263
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,500
crashing it had to become an hex

264
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,220
cotter then with 6 propellers and this

265
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,880
would have saved me from pain but

266
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,470
unfortunately the engine did not arrive in

267
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,030
time and therefore I did not have it not

268
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,720
yet  mount

269
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,970
so if you want redundancy you must

270
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,050
have at least a crush

271
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:37,129
having two drones we also bought

272
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:38,899
from remote controls it is an interesting thing

273
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:40,939
that we can do with this setup and

274
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:45,109
connect them via a 3 mm audio jack

275
00:13:45,109 --> 00:13:47,480
and a half and it is possible to use the

276
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,929
remote controls in live masters so a  an

277
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,980
instructor in full control of the drone

278
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,929
while the student in control only

279
00:13:56,929 --> 00:14:00,019
of the basic functions and the

280
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:03,169
movement of the limited sticks in order not

281
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:04,910
to avoid damage and the instructor

282
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,269
after correcting at any time

283
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:10,609
among other things if you want to do some tests

284
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:11,899
of this kind

285
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:14,299
next week next

286
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,399
weekend and between two weekends in ferrara there is

287
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,040
the balloon fair and there is

288
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,279
marco robustini who is one of the beta

289
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,970
testers the italian developers very

290
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,879
important to me for the ardu

291
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:37,009
copter project and you can do some tests  with

292
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,269
its drones that are a bit more serious than

293
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:40,220
ours

294
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,929
so we decided to dedicate

295
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:44,600
this helicopter to training for pe  r to

296
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,269
teach those who want to fly the

297
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:51,079
drone and to use them a bit as

298
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:54,559
toys in fact we have

299
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,139
some challenges among us

300
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:59,389
one of these is to enter the bathroom of

301
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:03,189
our acrid space with the

302
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:07,339
quadcopter challenges that are not always successful

303
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,999
for now  no refusal to enter the bathroom

304
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:13,749
this is a bit I say it is a

305
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:16,009
relatively narrow corridor

306
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:18,169
we go on and on the mountains because we are

307
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:20,689
short of time without gps because we are

308
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:23,029
inside the house

309
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:26,709
the bathroom door that

310
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:30,970
always ends well on the right and in any case we

311
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,670
have enough to have fun

312
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,529
then what do we have to talk about

313
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:39,350
well after the code paintings I feel

314
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:46,749
like experimenting on other vehicles show

315
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,149
quadcopters worth helicopters are

316
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,209
similar in type of control they

317
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,549
can still stay still nine

318
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:57,319
languages so we switched to

319
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:58,790
something different

320
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,209
she is a modeling classic

321
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:06,589
so  documentation is finished I thought

322
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:09,489
maybe a little simpler so I

323
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:12,439
got carried away and a friend  who

324
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:15,470
here in the room gave me a beautiful

325
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,639
model recovered from the infamous areas

326
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,600
with balsa wood I started to repair them

327
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,290
a little bit but the investigating judge rightly

328
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,999
advised me not to start as models below

329
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,529
because if they are destroyed

330
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:31,220
from the low

331
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,429
I worked for nothing and we are aimed

332
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:37,850
at  obi and the super easy we

333
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,939
arrived at albi king known site where

334
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:43,610
too much money is spent and we bought

335
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,569
this bixler that the basis to

336
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:52,129
start learning to use the rings by

337
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:55,279
the way quite easy is not too

338
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,929
fast to a good autonomy and well

339
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:01,509
we took it came from man

340
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:05,329
humanity in a field near ours

341
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:09,109
for expenses did not make the first

342
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,819
launch attempts because it launches off the

343
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:16,189
cuff takes off with the wheels this we

344
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:19,369
crashed the first ten

345
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:23,059
times with various with various problems  and

346
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:26,720
you appear as you can see from the American master

347
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,279


348
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,139
and okay in reality all

349
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:32,280
I can tell you is

350
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,100
that unlike a quadcopter that in

351
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,440
case you have  some doubts about how to

352
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,980
continue to command it you can leave it

353
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,020
still in hovering in some way it

354
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,210
helps to regain control

355
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,360
this here comes towards you or

356
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,460
it is moving away there is no way to

357
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,550
stop it you have to be just a little more

358
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,850
ready and it is much easier  make it

359
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,550
crash than any other

360
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:04,530
multi-doctor helicopter for which

361
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,300
our policeman tried to

362
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,840
put a pilot here too because

363
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,660
the art pilot provides three types of firmware

364
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,970
for the many doctors for the planes and

365
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,930
also for the nine the first test

366
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,500
we did it with the pm

367
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,330
we totally wanted the nose

368
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,730
we just refitted so this

369
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,020
is where we are now

370
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,990
it's the latest possible update

371
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,140
so it's a lot of fun jared yesterday it's

372
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,200
pretty exciting because they go

373
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,920
away they

374
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,680
travel pretty fast  but they are

375
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,030
very difficult later instead he wants to

376
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:52,430
tell us briefly, give us two minutes

377
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,910
in case you want to start me of

378
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,160
course  I have nothing to teach you

379
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,240
because I started in September

380
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,720
of last year so it is not that I know

381
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,350
very much

382
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,890
some things are quite important

383
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,550
for safety

384
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,260
now I know that it is a break of

385
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,650
browns but then these them that here

386
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,480
seem absolutely harmless are

387
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,740
extremely sharp  and they are

388
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,280
quite hard plastic so there are

389
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,960
very funny pictures on the internet of

390
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,330
people with a series of spots on their

391
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,950
forearms for example because they were

392
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,110
doing the electronics tests

393
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,340
they started a motor with the propellers

394
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,140
attached ion strained half of a

395
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,320
forearm

396
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,280
me  myself I inadvertently put my fingers on it

397
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,460
more than once

398
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,770
until I had some small propellers

399
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,780
still okay with these here I

400
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,930
kept a beautiful bruise on my hand

401
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,750
for let's say a week plus the cut

402
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,650
obviously the batteries of these objects

403
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,320
are hypo batteries  the hypo have

404
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,070
an annoying feature they are a bit

405
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,500
unstable so they tend to be a

406
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,030
pack of  explosive inside a battery

407
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,880
a battery of these is a not

408
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,310
very expensive object 20 30 euros

409
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,260
this is a 4 amp battery which has

410
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,480
a dump capacity of 20 times

411
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,600
its nominal capacity so it is

412
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,630
four amps by 20 this means

413
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,860
we to the object that  able to

414
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,920
deliver a peak 80 a lost no more and it is

415
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,300
clear that from the electrical point of view

416
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,190
for example you have to stay a little bit

417
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,630
because in case I miss a short

418
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,490
this here the bouncers 80 mwhy a

419
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,660
decent kick nor the other thing is the

420
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,490
piloting that is where you find where you

421
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,670
play until it crashes is the least

422
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,300
of the problems

423
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,700
that is when a quad has crashed

424
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,040
when a trio crashes we know where

425
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,500
it crashes and it is there typically the

426
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,290
real problem is the opposite that is when an

427
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,210
object you are testing  takes and

428
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,870
squirts off this stuff here it

429
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,150
serenely runs 20 kilometers per hour

430
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,740
the three I have not yet measured but

431
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,410
in my opinion it reaches around 40 has

432
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,900
an autonomy of 10 minutes fifteen

433
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,540
minutes  it goes very far before the battery runs out

434
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,680


435
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,450
if for any reason you can no

436
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,870
longer control it so be

437
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,500
careful

438
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,540
in theory an enac regulation came out

439
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:24,390
not so long ago that is

440
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,970
foreseen for the control

441
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,380
then you tell me when I have to cut that

442
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,960
if anything  let's go on out that it is intended

443
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,670
for the control of what they

444
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,690
call

445
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,540
remotely piloted aircraft the aprs the aprs are

446
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,490
objects are those are the real drones

447
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,660
that is, they are the objects that you

448
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,960
program and are able to go

449
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,080
to such distances that  who launched

450
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,960
it is no longer able to keep the

451
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,280
distance visual control

452
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,970
theoretically these models

453
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,500
are out of the control of this

454
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,900
legislation which speaks of objects for

455
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,400
critical operations therefore

456
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,409
television shooting support for

457
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:12,030
civil protection operations and things of this type

458
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,380
this does not mean  to say that they are

459
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,250
harmless objects

460
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,740
that is, if you jump in your face a 30 per hour

461
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,900
is an object that weighs a kilo with some

462
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,100
propellers spinning strong so

463
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,659
I personally

464
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:28,600
recommend insurance but simply because

465
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,870
legal disputes maroni breakages to no end

466
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:36,220
second what I told them about the hypo and

467
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,090
the hypo are a bit delicate in they should not be

468
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,330
loaded too much if they are damaged and yes

469
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,960
swell means that part of the

470
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,210
internal chemistry is damaged this

471
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,789
means that they develop

472
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:52,960
potentially flammable gases

473
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,520
if you overload a hypo that

474
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,010
explodes the lithium burns which is a pleasure

475
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,620
and therefore it is difficult to extinguish them

476
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,049
with water they do not go out so you

477
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,600
would need a bucket of  sand

478
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,630
in short, inquire about the

479
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,539
last thing the limits I told you

480
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:13,510
the enac does not provide for legislation at the

481
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,070
moment in Italy for objects of this

482
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,200
type because they are considered radio

483
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,330
models radio models means that they

484
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,770
are objects that you check on

485
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,429
sight

486
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:23,830
everything that is c  I mount a

487
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,020
video camera and buy the goggles, the

488
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,710
screen and look at what he sees,

489
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,960
theoretically he won't  they give more a pr

490
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,580
because you don't make it a pr in the

491
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,530
sense that you are not checking it by

492
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,250
looking at it

493
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,730
if you decide to play with these

494
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,740
technologies always get someone

495
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,539
who is with you and who keeps an

496
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:48,429
eye on the model because sometimes it is

497
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:50,679
very difficult to  what he sees

498
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,230
understand where you are because clearly

499
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,809
the perception of spaces is very

500
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,640
different from what we are

501
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,400
used to a park you know

502
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,080
seen from 30 meters high is very

503
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,890
different there are limits also for

504
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,789
model makers so also for  people that

505
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:11,029
those models are 70 meters high and

506
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:13,100
200 meters radius from where you

507
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,909
are

508
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:15,559
if you have the valerio modeller's license

509
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,379
I think it extends to 150

510
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:22,190
meters high and 400 away I

511
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,960
assure you that an object of this

512
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,940
size

513
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,559
if you don't have very,

514
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,479
very cool electronics that have functions that

515
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:32,600
make your life easier and I don't have them and at the

516
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,989
moment I think they are practically there

517
00:24:35,989 --> 00:24:39,039
in the sense that the gps went that I do not

518
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,109
already have at 30 meters it is very difficult to understand

519
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:44,389
how it was shot and its

520
00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:46,190
reference system is never yours the

521
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,139
forward is

522
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:49,489
not necessarily back and forth is not necessarily backwards

523
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:52,099
on the  remote control and therefore also

524
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:55,129
correcting if you are not clear how it

525
00:24:55,129 --> 00:25:00,879
is shot is complicated it is an

526
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:06,309
extremely fun hobby be careful

527
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:14,840
that unfortunately we have not

528
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,749
brought our types alone explode

529
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:20,259
this is what happens

530
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:30,969
we do

531
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:39,260
modify it become so

532
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,190
then you no longer

533
00:25:51,190 --> 00:26:04,460
have to use it you need a  lithium

534
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,500
battery a lithium battery is not soft a

535
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,280
lithium battery is hard if pressing the

536
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,530
case it becomes soft it means that

537
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,490
there is gas inside

538
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,930
so I know it is ugly it is expensive to

539
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,610
give up a battery costs in emotional terms

540
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,290


541
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,990
but I would avoid if I were  in flight to

542
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,920
play with it because it is dangerous for your

543
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,600
hands and dangerous for your home

544
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,040
so typically when the battery

545
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,750
charges it where it charges it at home in  garage

546
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,250
somewhere difficult to

547
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,110
load it 30 meters and a half to the garden in

548
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:40,640
a sandbag, however, what

549
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,770
we have seen wrong the batteries of

550
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,640
dubious Chinese origin of dubious quality

551
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,890
after the passive around alone so

552
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,570
or it turns off a little more  you take it two

553
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:01,270
so it doesn't formally forward you forever

554
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,750
it's not a good question

555
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,870
no question

556
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,590
yes

557
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:22,049
now it's a little bit that we

558
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:26,119
built it this one maybe they said

559
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:45,320
well there is a moment ahead

560
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,460
but above all the face close when it

561
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:07,340
is forming amount done one  estimate

562
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,650
last year with the previous monster

563
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,620
talk I can tell you that they built

564
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,690
probably cost you a party

565
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:19,450
hundreds of euros among 400 of material

566
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,070
it is not so if you do it for the first

567
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,360
time it will make many mistakes to understand the

568
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,920
sizing of the alias engines

569
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,650
that  are the controllers of the motors and

570
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,530
propellers and many other things for which we the

571
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,670
first time that they have spent a

572
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:38,450
thousand euros from the final the inclusion of a

573
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:48,580
radio control is exalted  to me

574
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,570
then already all of the sensors on board

575
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,060
lardo paolo will be able to the gps the mind that

576
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,390
conceals you which is a separate module and

577
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,400
in the latest versions also the

578
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,290
magnetometer has been taken out

579
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,170
because it suffers a bit of the various

580
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,940
possible interference so

581
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,560
mount it a little distant from the

582
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,140
electronics that passes, having seen its

583
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,260
operation well,

584
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:28,930
other otherwise okay thanks bye bye
