1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,620
ok i'm stefano

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,109
used

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:08,940
hi everyone i'm stefano I work for

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,980
the analysis that is the company that develops

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,950
in the server and I'm here to talk to you about

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,470
this today in the center is a

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,630
linux distribution designed for

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,310
small and medium offices small and medium

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,750
enterprises therefore  of the order of

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,920
fifty users is based on 100 and

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,039
together with those rojas and asm and server we

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,380
collaborate in the special interest group

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,230
of janis for simple linux server it

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,059
can be downloaded for free and distributed

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,050
with gpl license and

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,030
the creative commons documentation

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,420
in short, all compensation is

18
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,930
born  with a disney fork served and stopped

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,960
herbert and

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,250
basically the same

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,680
server and distribution objectives we

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,150
used before as a basis for

23
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,460
our products but despite we

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,080
really appreciated some aspects such as

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,740
the template generation system

26
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,780
for other reasons it no longer suited us so

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,670
well for  For example, the development was

28
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,170
almost at a standstill nor did we collaborate in the

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,289
development of sme server however often

30
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:18,210
the n  The new features that we proposed

31
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,119
were rejected and therefore we had a

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,280
progressive fork of the individual packages

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,380
at the end we looked for

34
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,240
the distribution directly starting from 2010

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,979
we started to develop on the server

36
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:34,560
in the servers is aimed at the

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,750
inexperienced administrator therefore who through

38
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,619
a web interface can configure a

39
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,530
server linux also say without having

40
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,119
particular skills but also

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,530
to the expert administrator who perhaps

42
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,349
wants to have more

43
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:51,720
tested configurations because in any case they are not

44
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,759
used on a wide user base and

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,039
homogeneous among his machines also

46
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,069
extremely faster to configure

47
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:00,780
than a  normal one hundred on a

48
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,550
common question why not just use a

49
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,979
hundred well if you want to

50
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,920
install one mail server out of 100 you will have to

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,780
download them sexy but top coat postfix

52
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,260
clamav from and to

53
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,510
put I don't know a client a web client

54
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,739
put all together with an

55
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,989
open temptation in the data to configure  the individual

56
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,150
configuration files

57
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,599
and at the end  get lost in the jargon of open

58
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,319
ssl with a conserve you do it with a few

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,519
clicks basically

60
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,190
the web interface

61
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,940
question of the screenshots

62
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,549


63
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:45,870
of the administration web interface you can see a demo

64
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,510
on a server punto jorge made to get

65
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,750
an idea of what the functions are  which

66
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,569
you can access from the interface the

67
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,019
features it has are two filters uses

68
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,109
squid script guard

69
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:02,390
and clamav

70
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:08,299
mail server with dark goth postfix and avis

71
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:13,290
file server for windows networks uses

72
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,989
samba 3

73
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:17,299
can be both

74
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:20,940
btc that can also join a

75
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,000
domain web server to one  I detach

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,730
and have it practically ready and

77
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,489
multidomain

78
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:31,260
a configurable firewall

79
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,030
from the low-level interface that

80
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,180
uses scholl wall to generate the bie

81
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,520
tables and that has

82
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,620
the multi wan allows you to have the multi

83
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,860
wan and the quality of service

84
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:51,500
vpn with vpn or in the two types  both vpn

85
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,470
host.net and in the tweet

86
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,520
groupware consoco and a cloud all of

87
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,440
this can be installed as an add-on in

88
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,890
a quick, simple and scalable way in the

89
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,990
sense that these sing  component oils

90
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,600
can be installed all together

91
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,940
a little at a time

92
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,290
safe because in any case it uses the

93
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,298
core binary packages and therefore they

94
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,149
are quite checked quite

95
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,680
discarded frequent security update

96
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,830


97
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,050
cloud ready because it can also be

98
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,569
installed on a hundred jokes stent

99
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,360
and therefore it is very common to find in the  various

100
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
various cloud services the image of

101
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,470
one hundred is ready and it is possible to

102
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,830
install it on the server and fast

103
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,990
because the layer it adds concerns

104
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,780
let's say only the configuration so the

105
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,080
basic one is a hundred and this makes it

106
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,270
quite performing even on

107
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,219
somewhat dated hardware  with the limitation that at the

108
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:53,110
moment there is only a 64-

109
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,750
bit version and probably not

110
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,900
unless someone wants to

111
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,490
try their hand there will always be

112
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,349
64-bit version and there are many a don ricci are

113
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:07,419
many women that can be

114
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:09,099
installed with one click all the

115
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:10,870
packages for  percent if they can be

116
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,659
installed by following the instructions

117
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:15,610
percent quind  i if you are interested in

118
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,830
installing a package that was not

119
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,840
foreseen there are problems if it can be

120
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,080
installed on 100 it is simple and very

121
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,729
simple both the interface and

122
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:27,029
the installation

123
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,270
precisely because it is also designed for

124
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,690
administrators who are not experts and

125
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,650
solid because it is basic at 100  which is one

126
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,150
of the most stable institutions around at the

127
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,820
moment and as I said it is

128
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,670
open both

129
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,370
the code released under the gpl license and

130
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,640
the documentation in creative commons and

131
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,560
also public 4r

132
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,750
this is a scheme to show you

133
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,410
a bit like the interface  generally among the

134
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,820
configuration insists the mechanism that

135
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,260
uses this is the one we

136
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,570
inherited from asm and server and that we have

137
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,690
only substantially modified

138
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,150
there is an

139
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,700
interface the web administration interface that

140
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,230
inserts parameters into

141
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,180
a database of  configuration parameters

142
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,610
like i don't know example ip address or

143
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,430
server name which ethernet card does

144
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,190
what and these parameters are

145
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,250
used for  fill in the templates that

146
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,770
generate the configuration files

147
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,920
the interface also generates signals

148
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,900
and events that are used to

149
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,880
regenerate the configuration files that

150
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,689
do not need to

151
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:46,509
configure the services

152
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,649
restart the services that need to

153
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:51,169
be restarted and this is important

154
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:52,989
because it

155
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:55,429
is always possible  make custom templates

156
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:57,860
that then generate

157
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,199
configuration files starting from the

158
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,089
same parameters that are placed

159
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,039
by the interface but which are

160
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:05,899
customized so if you have a couple

161
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:09,860
of configurations that but which part of the

162
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,029
changes that have not been foreseen

163
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,979
you can always make a  custom template

164
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,949
then generate this

165
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,009
configuration file and then it will still be

166
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,249
capped and it will still be modifiable

167
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:23,360
interface in short it integrates

168
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,229
perfectly with the system

169
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,110
this is a bit of the status of the

170
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,949
distribution then it is let's say started

171
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:36,110
in the first version it was the first

172
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,169
development version in the  2012 is the

173
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:42,079
important thing  and here it is used in

174
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,959
news production but in production for

175
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,959
a year or a little more than a year and now

176
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,789
there is the stable version so it is

177
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:54,459
usable to try

178
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:57,409
if you want to use it in the server now if

179
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,819
you just want to see the interface we

180
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:01,490
have the demo if  you want to

181
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,870
start using at the

182
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,039
starting point is the

183
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:06,979
administrator's manual where you find let's say

184
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:08,120
everything that can be used to

185
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,300
start is installable both from iso as

186
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,180
a normal distro and on a choice

187
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,819
we said from a couple of commands

188
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,810
for support there are two mail lists

189
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,270
English into Italian so you can

190
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,240
write the two channels

191
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,860
always

192
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,899
English Italian on the north and there is an

193
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,659
Italian facebook group the

194
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,029
enterprise support is not directly on a

195
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:43,240
server but on a derivative product and

196
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,529
if you possibly need it to

197
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:48,860
happen if you are interested you want

198
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,620
stay informed about developments

199
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,860
you can follow on twitter on the server

200
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,089
always the same facebook group with

201
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:58,070
directly follow ibba trackers udev

202
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,740
in the ser  ver punto org

203
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,250
like any open source project

204
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,950
all participations are welcome to

205
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,520
participate with also simply wanting to

206
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,140
install them give

207
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,300
feedback or ask questions or report pack

208
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,490


209
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,310


210
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,320


211
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,399
written in mail list and

212
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,960
also on tab you can check

213
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,970
if you can not check the status you can

214
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,300
collaborate that you can also collaborate on

215
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,460
the documentation

216
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,820
if you see them some links on other

217
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,160
documentation on how to do rpm for

218
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,990
the server and we are at eboli of the

219
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,430
rpm  and to make them the first to do to

220
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,870
reach the modules to the war interface

221
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,660


222
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,680
and that's all

223
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,680
questions

224
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:09,050
there are between one way the artist has seen

225
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,450
the web

226
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,690
you are

227
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,780
basically you can do everything

228
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,280
you can do with one with the

229
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,870
configuration of a  pacman sense you do not

230
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,510
do it as an interface but then modify it

231
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,700
as you see fit in short, then do

232
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,610
all that with a brown template  that

233
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,200
everything you want and not you

234
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,940
the configuration interface does not

235
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,300
limit you in the possibilities of editing the

236
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,300
files, let's say it is a help but then also

237
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,750
doing without it

238
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,650
is a strong dismissed for maybe I

239
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,220
went too fast

240
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,519
it is very similar to a fork and

241
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,630
we collaborate however we already

242
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,120
collaborated with servers we continue to

243
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,329
collaborate for what is the sic of

244
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:08,220
100 the special interest group is simple

245
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,190
of the news server

246
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,400
and the reasons for the strong here were precisely

247
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,140
that we could not carry on the

248
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,240
development to start for denise me serves

249
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,550
in the direction  where we needed it to

250
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:26,660
go and it was a little firm so this

251
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,630
really lethal

252
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:38,880
then it is the date then you can let's say make

253
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,470
some changes to the configuration of

254
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,399
the app but luckily you

255
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,290
would probably have difficulty doing it because

256
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,120
all the temptation of the users except

257
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,019
the user  of all its

258
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,540
to originate nothing

259
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,350
would be to throw another

260
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,649
indication

261
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,150
on another tree on another tree by

262
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,320
students of a  other

263
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,740
then to use other machines

264
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,510
without pressure yes yes indeed

265
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,220
in short

266
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,670
because samba four at the moment

267
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,260
affects too many parts of the system

268
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,270
such as water dns so on and

269
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,920


270
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,690
because we are thinking of an integration but

271
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,330
if ever if ever it will come that is the moment

272
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,150
we have  tried a little bit but with little

273
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,330
results if it ever arrives it will almost

274
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,590
certainly be on docker, that is, on a

275
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,580
separate container

276
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,870
ok
