1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,449
so let's start just like professional things

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,740
here then nothing my

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,450
name is franco lanfredi i was

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,490
called by sebastiano where is that i

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,380
saw him before he left here she is

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,230
sebastiano to come and give a little bit of a

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,189
speech about what is the world of 4k

8
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:28,050
therefore the video processing with

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,730
this type of format is stopped

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,530
relatively new because it allows us

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,559
to have very high resolutions and

12
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,110
the image quality certainly

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,970
remarkable let's say that the cables

14
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,430
we know that compared to the four thirds

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,130
in the ball when there was still

16
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,620
television  cathode ray tube beam

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,760
was 720 x 576 event in which it came out in

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,090
high definition they went to milena

19
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,910
living x 1080 therefore having almost three

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,900
times the possibility of having pixels both

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,650
in width and in height and for the

22
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,869
clear that the current gen is  stop

23
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:23,900
tunisia continues to move forward and it is

24
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,479
clear that the horizon is never known

25
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,229
which is the best but there is never an

26
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:34,040
end point there is always an end point

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,170
now let's talk about the Italian tip of

28
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,380
4k because we are talking about 4 thousand pixels

29
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,860
approximately because the stops difference

30
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,110
emerges when the type of

31
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,710
product that is sealed and also the

32
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,000
parent company

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,800
but no

34
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:00,880
I hope so on to see in me so

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,780
I approached the world  on video for

36
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,460
several years I have written books do not be afraid

37
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,180
of graphic lava and therefore of web

38
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,990
design because it pulled a community and is

39
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:22,630
called to designer experiments says the

40
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,680
ipad version iwata one of those who

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,890
tried alone to delve into

42
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,610
what are the themes  of the

43
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,810
digital world access is a bigger thing

44
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,310
for dense and less but I see that the

45
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,350
results are there for which I know but I believe

46
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,720
that my will, my passion that

47
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,830
binds me is a line-by-line theme rewarded

48
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,410
by what is the mission and  the

49
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,840
participation of myself in this

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,590
world the heir you know very well

51
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,600
multiple scenes that pass in front of the

52
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,410
computer and I enjoy myself and I enjoy

53
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,400
elaborating do or hurry here is my but

54
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,890
c  continuous research a continuous a curtain

55
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,170
will in deepening new things

56
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,500
new themes and I must say that

57
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,600
the khatami painting a little bit

58
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,200
so involved in the moment in which it

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,990
took to this except this phantom ii

60
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,500
from worse andrea who is a dealer

61
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,320
that remain  Veneto for as well as

62
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,590
being a reseller has a great

63
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,380
capacity that for listening to

64
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,040
understanding the customer's issues of

65
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,010
people who need to acquire

66
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,770
technology is approached because the

67
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,390
need because he did not want to

68
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,520
know more about drones because what I live

69
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,100
in 2012  it could have ended up against

70
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,750
a brunette and died poor man so

71
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,180
I said enough I don't want to know

72
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,760
about drones anymore while in reality it is not

73
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,250
really so you have

74
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,890
to always put a large pan

75
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,470
of the door and hope that then in the

76
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,079
meantime to straight technologies but

77
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:27,180
always  safer and more professional must

78
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,170
say that when I tried these

79
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,050
phantoms I said damn steps

80
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,130
were taken t  anti

81
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,030
compared to the one that had assembled

82
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,010
micro cutter and safety certainly

83
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,010
a huge advantage especially

84
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,919
when trying to work clear that they fall

85
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,780
down as for these too unfortunately

86
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,760
the electronics have its own component of

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,710
weakness for which it must be observed but

88
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,550
respect in the  the moment you take a

89
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,740
device of this kind you don't do it

90
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,450
as a profession

91
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,330
now you do it as in my case for fun

92
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,790
for fun even if as a location

93
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,919
called to make ambitious projects that

94
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,620
said when you took

95
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,569
these

96
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:29,669
drones open there  the gopro was also the somersault

97
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:32,789
suffered over the time of the notable

98
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:33,929
evolutions

99
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:37,199
I had lago perano that recorded

100
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,020
in full hd

101
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,839
but with a really poor quality

102
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,880
when

103
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,600
I bought the pro 3 plus

104
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,200
here they are opened in laughter I

105
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,050
do not know when I will go out  lake for a4 what

106
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,660
kind of horizon there will be however it is clear

107
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,390
that already this type of machine

108
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,520
allows us to make elaborates with

109
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,810
very large ev  olutions evolutions

110
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,190
both in graphics but also in the video field it

111
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,380
is clear that we are always talking about a

112
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,660
prosumer product we will say a

113
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,900
professional drak'kast product there is not on

114
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,940
board this tram and the possibility of

115
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,420
bringing in conceal one would also remain a

116
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:33,400
canon mark digital reflex  ii or so on

117
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,110
in short, however, become however allows us

118
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,800
with respect to precisely these reflexes to

119
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,620
record this type of

120
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,690
gopro director in 4k already in 4k 12 stills according to

121
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,360
heaven few are few because you know

122
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,140
well that our vision in action in

123
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,480
the abusive field needs 25 brakes

124
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,680
second to see a fluid thing in

125
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,100
reality 12 frames to be interpolated

126
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,460
in a very sophisticated way to

127
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,190
allow a congruous display

128
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,430
in essence it is believed where the facts

129
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,650
because I find missing frames must

130
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,680
be built there must be done

131
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,170
by machines

132
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,300
then now maybe I have  many projects

133
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,450
that I have done

134
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:36,490
let's say that what I said before are

135
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,160
always in continuous experimentation for

136
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,050
me it is a c  Continuous progress do not go

137
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:53,950
on tell me and a half here for which I

138
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,860
will then finish my intervention by

139
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,620
showing us also some panoramic views

140
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,660
made of effect always because the

141
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,710
possibility that from this

142
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:14,950
multiple drone if we talk about videos and

143
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,510
photos

144
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,220
we have the possibility to do the

145
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,860
interpolated  as we want to

146
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,100
see for example a I know a video of

147
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,510
this kind

148
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,690
I'm here is a movie that but now we

149
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:34,679
will not hear not only because first yes

150
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,830
here in this case I am asking about

151
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,120
an image in 4k

152
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,019
there are sequences we would act with

153
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:06,410
a sony camera  from stationary from third he

154
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,720
backed here instead we have a

155
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,959
camera on the south drone

156
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,980
this is the runner who wanted to make it clear

157
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,520
that in life there is no shell to eat

158
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,360
prescript but also we can tell ourselves

159
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,029
in the race to stay a bit in

160
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:36,279
shape  what I can no longer do

161
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,290
more than one object also the stabilizer bar

162
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,069


163
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:54,209
here we zoom we add up because the

164
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:59,550
project was shot the project and in

165
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,689
hd therefore at 1900 20 x 1080 however

166
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:08,059
when I entered the

167
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:12,209
sequences shot I connect po in 4k

168
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:14,730
I did a sort of upscaling that is

169
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,170
to say that substance the 4k was

170
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,779
imported into high definition and

171
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,779
then I should show you all the

172
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,699
procedure however but there are eighteen

173
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:29,489
minutes I see that there are 8 missing

174
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,199
I do not know if there is time to go

175
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,929
deeper into the subject but there

176
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:37,829
are tutorials on the internet if you go to

177
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:41,959
my facebook page you can also

178
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,029
find them where I explain in a little way

179
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:48,149
simpler and more concise second time and

180
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:50,939
want the possibility of being able to then

181
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:53,129
get upscaling and then

182
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:57,480
zooming while maintaining an

183
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,119
adequate pixel resolution quality because if

184
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,809
I zoom 200 percent it is clear that

185
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:08,100
the configuration in pixels decays while

186
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,399
having shot with  a resolution

187
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,470
twice that of high definition

188
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,429
I have the possibility of having a

189
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:24,240
brown resolution here if we go and

190
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,729
see

191
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:32,039
a moment a little step back I

192
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:38,489
here in  this moment unfortunately sorry

193
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:47,039
that it does not make it but then here I go away

194
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:56,879
so you see this is the resolution in

195
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,879
4k brought to hd however the resolution

196
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,439
that was there before when

197
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:09,959
I zoomed was good right and

198
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,759
clear that either machines are used

199
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,889
of the procedures that allow the drones to

200
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:21,269
redo the blue mechanical zoom or

201
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:23,639
as in this case we do it

202
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,659
digital level things are a little different

203
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:31,859
but it is clear that with this stratagem

204
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:35,239
it is possible to bypass what is the

205
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:37,739
impossibility of being able to do something about

206
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:39,470
this  generally

207
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,529
then it is clear that 4k lends itself to

208
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:49,579
manipulation they already have only

209
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,489
4 thousand x 2160 flat 8 million pixels

210
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:56,129
if we then record with a

211
00:13:56,129 --> 00:14:01,529
go pro setting on our own where there is the

212
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,959
possibility of having a very

213
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,419
opposite focal length and the possibility of recording

214
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,749
very high information of colors to

215
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,659
be able to be manipulated

216
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:15,109
then so we can also have

217
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:19,139
through the camera raw the possibility

218
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,569
of managing an infini  ty of colors that

219
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,459
are unthinkable until yesterday

220
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:33,000
then I will show you that the examples

221
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,959
here too there is a zoomed in

222
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:12,730
and clear that suggestive images like

223
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:20,740
these give a great emotion because it

224
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,500
looks because it tries to convey

225
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,839
its own feeling that even in the race

226
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,010
to its  meaning

227
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,230
the interesting thing to use a multitude

228
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,160
of technology is not enough the drone

229
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,700
is not enough the camera sometimes

230
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,920
the telescopic bar is also used

231
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,710
because where the drone does not arrive

232
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,650
or where there are

233
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,220
inaccessible spaces the bar that I have from 5

234
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,709
meters  and a half, however, there are also from 8

235
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:16,420
meters by 13 meters and allow you to

236
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,790
do works that have their own

237
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,449
quality that which previously could not

238
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:30,520
be done could not be done that is to change

239
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,830
perspective and important in my opinion has

240
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,699
its own logic

241
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,570
here I am here with  this video

242
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,850
I wanted a little while to represent

243
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,399
what is the possibility of

244
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:16,159
use even in a job that can

245
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,360
be a professional job for for

246
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,169
in this case a runner

247
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:27,740
then I do not know you have some questions to ask

248
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,380
that is you are interested in the topic

249
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,080
which are the development themes I

250
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,690
do not know ask me well there is no

251
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,929
problem

252
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:44,590
now it always depends on understanding

253
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,860
how we have now looked at a gig and

254
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,610
15 but it is  clear that compression for

255
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,450
the web, however, is born with

256
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,400
if we look at the compression in

257
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,770
progress 422 which is the quicktime format

258
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,610


259
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,430
then we have filmed in this genre

260
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,110
of a couple of minutes it can also have 9gb

261
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,290
there are also some panoramic images

262
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:19,420
that I have done recently they are 700  mega

263
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,430
from the clear resolution that changes then

264
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:29,710
tell me then I use the editing

265
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:35,090
mac then I use final cut but not

266
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,810
version 7 I use final cut pro hicks

267
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:42,190
the latest version with different plugins

268
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,010
then it is clear that support

269
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,100
depending on what you want to do  I also use

270
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,820
after effects or photoshop itself

271
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,880
in fact

272
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,980
photoshop since it started having the

273
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,130
release and cs6 has also started

274
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,410
importing video formats for  which

275
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,650
color correction processing

276
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,910
can be done with photoshop and

277
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,740
exceptional things can come out like

278
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,390
now let's see if I can sin

279
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,580
this is a time lapse

280
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,900
doing such a job is a mess of

281
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,810
time I had to say immediately because it is not a

282
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:58,270
simple thing you have to  stay there half an hour

283
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,230
even this elaborate

284
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,750
then as you can see here there are some

285
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:36,450
very surreal colors since I live in

286
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:41,789
a world today that does not satisfy me so I

287
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:43,559
prefer to immerse myself in a surreal world

288
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,410
precisely because everyday life is a great

289
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,010
[ __ ]

290
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,010
here so we live the world for a moment  in

291
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,000
a bit difficult

292
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,770
and then since many ask me

293
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,710
why you elaborate with these

294
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,370
strong colors but it comes to my personal taste

295
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:05,280
I like to manipulate and these are

296
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,520
the colors that are given by the go pro

297
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,080
but they are then processed with photoshop

298
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,090
I maybe do you  see what

299
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,679
happens that happened today to make you

300
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,080
understand how you can also make

301
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:32,090
panoramas of this kind during that

302
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,418
he ap  steep

303
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:01,210
then you as you see venice

304
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:07,210
but if we go

305
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:15,510
made today at half

306
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:20,140
past two i went to venice i raised the drone from

307
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,460
piazza san marco

308
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,290
i moved about

309
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,590
fifty meters i got up 70

310
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,030
here i made a video in 4k and then

311
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,780
this overview was developed with photoshop

312
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,790
which is an automated one that

313
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,540
allows me to choose the frames

314
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,360
and put them practically conflict

315
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,200
emerges coupled is an excellent

316
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,320
distraction of photoshop which

317
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,520
however allows to reach these results

318
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,360
in short,

319
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,730
this is

320
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,059
with the phantom and the gopro  therefore an

321
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:12,760
investment that we are talking about 1,500 euros

322
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,080
we are not talking about huge investments and it is

323
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,700
clear that you need to know the

324
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,730
issues to get to this you are

325
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,740
interested this thing here I do not know

326
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:45,429
then then in the meantime I always try and

327
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:50,570
Andrea knows he is working safely

328
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:55,669
and clearly that if how  it was clear that,

329
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:58,820
like the phantom, it can reach almost 200

330
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,880
meters in height and can reach a

331
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,570
kilometer and a half as re  cezione

332
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,950
yes I did it more than once he

333
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,350
also probed the then it is clear that if he

334
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:13,340
loses the signal and if the gp and if

335
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,220
the gps is working and he has memorized the

336
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,850
starting point he is coming home

337
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,950
twisted home  automatically and returns

338
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,580
home at a height of 25 meters and goes down it does

339
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,820
everything by itself if you turn off the

340
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,390
receiver if it happens in any

341
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:40,190
problem let's say that if it is not if the

342
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,610
receiver no longer communicates with

343
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,200
the device the device still

344
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,320
feels that it no longer knows  who is in charge and he

345
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,789
returns home

346
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:55,100
right then essentially he returns to the

347
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,730
point of having to leave he goes down alone

348
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,320
so there is

349
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,909
always if there is gps coverage so

350
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:07,190
there are no absolute

351
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,220
signal losses and so on

352
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,929
but it is clear that in short  they are always

353
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:17,020
tools that need a great deal of

354
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:20,550
control and must be absolutely

355
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:24,100
held in great respect as I repeat

356
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,930
to you therefore the enac legislation is hidden which is

357
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:32,590
a legislation but there is no implementation

358
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,450
this what does it mean that

359
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,460
f  while there is no law a

360
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,190
regulation that punishes the

361
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:45,080
citizen for hicks there is not

362
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,010
the important thing is to be covered by

363
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,020
insurance when you

364
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,600
fly that if you hurt you do not

365
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,270
risk the penalty because if  you go on

366
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,040
someone in short, there is always a risk

367
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,890
in that sense, but on the part of the enac it is

368
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,010
true there is this legislation that has come out

369
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,260
that theory everyone should be on the

370
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,170
ground if they are not if it is not a

371
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,070
license and it is not the  qualification with the

372
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,060
vehicles approved by them you should not,

373
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,840
however, even there in that case there is still a

374
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,700
lot of confusion there is no

375
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,850
security in this type of argument at the

376
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,750
moment it lies in the good sense of those who

377
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,420
pilot in not putting at

378
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,200
risk  the people who work with

379
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,070
these means

380
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,160
here you should always go where there are

381
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,520
no people here I am in this case and

382
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,680
roll in piazza san marco which is the means

383
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,040
to me gave full satellites I was calm

384
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,450
I got up for a moment since he

385
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,580
responded very well and  then i f  act

386
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,560
all my work between my work

387
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,340
was far from then it is clear that I

388
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,140
had to land but in short, you

389
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,420
always look for a bit of common sense
