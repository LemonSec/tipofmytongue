1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,300
so I introduce myself my name is paolo

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,950
that only a very complicated surname is not

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,420
that name they go up with my German

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,870
anyway from ferrara I am part of the fra

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,960
jul del ponti professionals like some

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,030
who will come maybe in the next days

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,310
that I know

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,740
I am also part of the only one in short

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,680
I do  made a few groups so as to make

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,910
the computer science banality of the serious

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,480
started in 85 I work more in the

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,400
management field that I do a lot of

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,869
database analysis etc. so here I am an

14
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:33,210
accomplice based on these things here but

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,190
the concept I think is important

16
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,020
so I asked to be able  to make a totti

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,000
on the subject precisely because it seems to me

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,200
that the subject is absolutely

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,290
important among other things it was abolished

20
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,250
very well with regard

21
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,360
to today's meeting my

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,680
intention was to come and talk

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,239
about something that is  happening that

24
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,280
could be enough with

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,890
quite heavy consequences and therefore

26
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,239
we try to have omitted 21 thousand euros

27
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,410
there  they are

28
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,699
quite heavy consensus sequences with disc

29
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,739
therefore let's now try to explain

30
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,630
some things it is clear that there are some

31
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,220
topics where some things are very

32
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,900
skilled others maybe a little

33
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,930
less and therefore usually my talk here

34
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,760
is prepared for also to be able  support

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,799
people who maybe what I know do not know

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,360
what a double symmetrical key is

37
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,170
thing of this type

38
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,850
here I will try to travel a little more

39
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,590
on these things and I immediately say about I leave

40
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,119
immediately with a thank you with a

41
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,890
certain they are not second choices andrea

42
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,970
colangelo

43
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,360
this  it is his blog which at linux

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,079
day fed of 2012 made a talk that he

45
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,729
recorded and that I accidentally found

46
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,079
on youtube

47
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,140
anyway you can find it on youtube where between

48
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,130
time

49
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,049
the face is so that American becomes

50
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,380
so definitively finished

51
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,119
practically witnessed he made a

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,170
beautiful  meeting on the topic

53
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,329
explaining well all the concepts of self

54
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,299
coreboot evf etc. and from there or derived a

55
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,770
lot among other things  in an available

56
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,149
way so if you then have very complex questions to pay

57
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:01,710
on the subject, etc., it is

58
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,210
probably better for you to turn it

59
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,159
directly that it is much more prepared

60
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,149
than these things must keep 1

61
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,450
point of the European start with some

62
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,430
very minimal concepts as a second

63
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,930
very simple thing to whom  standards are needed

64
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,670
and clearly we know

65
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,660
very well that everything that came out a little bit

66
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,099
today so the

67
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,739
same internet the same the brake for

68
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,500
example extreme the

69
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,420
power supply the mobile phone power supply you see that

70
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,000
today there is this usb connector is

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,620
something a  bit strange in the sense because it is an

72
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,290
important thing that we usually say

73
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,200
so the innovations related to the

74
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,640
standards are related to the fact that there is

75
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,500
someone who sponsors them crispin g and

76
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,510
there are groups that we say that the

77
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,069
lobbies that usually push these by

78
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:45,720
being  alle l'ispano go ahead for

79
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,060
market reasons there are some things that

80
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,010
by their nature are against the market

81
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,690
this one  it is something against the market

82
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,910
because obviously until now it was much

83
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,980
more convenient for companies to try to

84
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,930
sell you when I bought the mobile phone

85
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,340
where the compartments the new power supply

86
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,560
buy the new wire for

87
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,420
the cigarette lighter so 10,000

88
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,400
billion attacks of two power supplies than at a

89
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,569
certain  point did not intervene

90
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,489
saying [ __ ] at least on the side beyond

91
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,459
the heel must be vs b then later

92
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,719
now there is also the reasoning

93
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,340
on the other side and therefore this is a

94
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,109
case in which practically something has

95
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:18,400
prevailed because being a point we

96
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,200
thought more about the  common good that has the

97
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,450
push of the lobbies on certain things and

98
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,730
the problem is that on a thousand other things

99
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,290
there is this situation here there are

100
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,799
things that for market reasons were born

101
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:31,599
like because the internet itself if you go

102
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,069
to see the internet does not  was born to

103
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:34,269
do the good of the people

104
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:36,790
then it had that side effect as a side

105
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,969
effect but it was practically the result

106
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,120
of an evolution that we say

107
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,469
market convenience has led to  then a

108
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:47,069
result that in the good of all therefore

109
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:49,540
in other situations this does not have as

110
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,669
much as possible this for it becomes the

111
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,500
premise for those good all is the

112
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,280
most to the minister the speech

113
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,099
of the easy feeder the easy word

114
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:58,709
and the drama of these

115
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,519
practically of these  years today

116
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,650
anyone any user you know go

117
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,269
on with on on on on we

118
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:05,680
live the civilization of the bank ahead

119
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,849
on whatever is in the middle

120
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,189
rights everything is fine

121
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:10,689
to reach the purpose that interests

122
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:12,250
you what is in the middle you will find out

123
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,129
dojo but this  it also applies to

124
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,019
regulations and this is not a small problem

125
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,810
because if I have to explain a

126
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,270
difficult concept you want an

127
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,220
easy concept and much more face also write

128
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,360
the phase I give an example we

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,840
talked about that disk encrypted before

130
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,250
but in a normal person  to have a

131
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,750
pinch of elbow in my opinion the

132
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,400
rip off because because the first time

133
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,720
something happens to me you those

134
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,159
the activity  united more outside not even for it

135
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,479
seems unless they remain between those who

136
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,120
can be spent and 500 euros so

137
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,800
probably for the normal user of

138
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,270
discovered kato it is more a rip-off than

139
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,000
anything else but it is much easier to

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,650
pass rather than this concept

141
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,449
as the concept that I you  i offer

142
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:51,880
something inherently unsafe and

143
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,990
that car offers a sure thing

144
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,060
is a much simpler concept my

145
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,830
system is safe he tells you so

146
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,990
because his number is a simpler concept

147
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,760
here people are more likely to

148
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,960
accept that concept  there and there are therefore

149
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,810
from the end of the aspects that concern the

150
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,730
advent of these standards they are not

151
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,130
purely technical they are technical aspects

152
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,780
are aspects of marketing pd how

153
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,790
these things are presented and how

154
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,190
people say finally perceive them and there

155
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,050
are aspects that are purely

156
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,640
commercial  linked to the fact that there

157
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,110
are lobbies that push etc. so

158
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,120
all this chaos must be made of the

159
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,800
polar laws that make c  homodo

160
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,530
to people so he had to digest

161
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,170
the famous easy concepts and then

162
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,760
let's see a little bit there are new

163
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,080
standards so now I am

164
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,340
finally calling to talk about these things of

165
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,070
this world the standard is called poets

166
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,560
that will take the place of the bios that breathes

167
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,970
the machine and  those first

168
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,310
program that starts when the system

169
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,220
is loaded we will talk about 6 core mood

170
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,190
which is a start mode made

171
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,610
just this wef in we will also talk about

172
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,820
the certifications of a company

173
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,570
but I don't know what because we will see

174
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,400
that this is what creates the casino no  and

175
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,890
we will see it later because in themselves these are not

176
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,620
negative things here eh the set

177
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,530
that creates a negative situation

178
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,410
we will also talk about a system i simply

179
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,370
wi fi system in bus stalls you have

180
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,900
never seen that speech for those said

181
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,730
with the key is one  standard for which he

182
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,960
started with the key automatically

183
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,060
in the loaded role system asks you

184
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,130
if you have not seen it because it does not exist

185
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,250
then let's go  forward

186
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,840
the bots but I guess here you know

187
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,950
how to do it apart from bayern alias the old

188
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,440
bay I am now part of the web to recall

189
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,050
this master boot record that 512

190
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,670
practically does not fit into it

191
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,350
anymore so consequently it

192
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,310
debuted there that is another

193
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,680
position  it is practically made for

194
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,630
which it starts the expenses so on

195
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,130
in short there is practically a chain of

196
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,590
software that is linked to the other

197
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,110
and this chain here potentially

198
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,580
dangerous because someone could have

199
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,900
replaced what I know

200
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,640
master boot record with something else

201
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,410
could have put in the master boot in the

202
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,390
body of the other or have put in the

203
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,500
boot loader something else that did not

204
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,730
have everything insert a virus

205
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,560
inside the kernel and so on

206
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,900
so there are inherent dangers

207
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,790
beyond the fact that when parked that

208
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,350
they do these things are very few

209
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,970
but potentially certain risk okay

210
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,350
here is an asymmetric double key explanation

211
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,140
I hope that sand

212
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,400
usually does it with  an explanation

213
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,960
just mentally a second you never know

214
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,030
if someone does not know it I say okay to

215
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,860
in fact a kind of signature generator

216
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,550


217
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,170
no practically a machine that of

218
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,850
guardian genus you do not have in a

219
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,740
signature generator the other in a

220
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,560
verifier of signatures you exchange

221
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,940
keys eto'o practically this mania

222
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,560
you can verify from a distance if what

223
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,630
I gave you with form what you had

224
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,340
learned of great advantage that these

225
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,630
things are not physical things they are

226
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,180
practically code and in practice you

227
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,980
generate keys  with this

228
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,600
key system you are the guarantee that what

229
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,340
actually sent you is

230
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,480
what I sent you it

231
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,580
seems like a thing if instead but the idea

232
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,470
was brilliant

233
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,960
then let's go and see this

234
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,870
famous wake that takes the place of the bios

235
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,920
then  in the meantime, you can see that he has already seen it

236
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,000
graphics must be quite another

237
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,980
thing

238
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,030
before it was all a blue thing

239
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,040
etc. In the meantime what was born

240
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,890
let's say the end of 2003 from int  el who

241
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,350
later passed it to a hi fi wi fi forum

242
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,690
is made up of very big companies amd

243
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,550
apple of the capibile month but they are

244
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,990
all evident in the face book among the

245
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,990
runtime services and also uses its

246
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,900
own drivers 15 its own drivers see inside  do you

247
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,490
remember how I said the beginning before it is

248
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,460
a deal that is better

249
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,929
I am sometimes not able to do that it was

250
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,990
512 bytes this to do here dine to

251
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,610
take a linux distribution pull

252
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,820
away the dredge everything is smaller than the

253
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,180
wef

254
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,460
practically an operating system

255
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,770
all effects under the machine that is there

256
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,730
at the beginning on windows vista service pack

257
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,220
1 windows server 2008 second and four

258
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,370
suits this was already very

259
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,950
detailed specifications in 2012 were already more

260
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,430
than two thousand pages tells me a common dad

261
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,930
so that he explains in detail  what

262
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,050
should your famous web do and therefore the

263
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,900
question is but what a baggage that has to

264
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,210
manage just over 2 seconds

265
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,680
practically as big as linux

266
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,610
already this in short that a bit strange

267
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,170
massacre as they say  or giving it less there is

268
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,820
also the fact that however it happens that the more

269
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,380
regulations mean the more mechanisms and the

270
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,780
more peculiarities you insert, the more

271
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,400
likely it is to find

272
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,270
loopholes to play games even a

273
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,270
command shell and so

274
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,240
system information is organized in tables  in

275
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,860
a file service and against them I tried

276
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,300
graphic teams

277
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,860
then after then apple has been using it for years as

278
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,210
an exclusive system for their computers

279
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,490
since January 2011 all the new

280
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,890
asus motherboards implement beyoncé we

281
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,000
will speak in all machines that today

282
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,550
come out with windows 8 point 18.0

283
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,090
they have compatibility mode its will be

284
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,260
doors so there is the possibility of

285
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,550
making a truth go that someone

286
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,870
calls go in a way something

287
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,850
like this that practically allows you

288
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,160
wanting to return to the old bios and

289
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,140
run it with the bios code written in

290
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,940
c is not written anymore  nor always per cent

291
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,490
and therefore even more easily

292
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,560
but do not keep by the company

293
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,120
ask that the companies that fan account  no

294
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,649
the wi fi they are the ones who rewrite this

295
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:23,029
program it is only they who know

296
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,080
what this program

297
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,360
does so it is not an open program even

298
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,920
if there is an open code wanting

299
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,470
to power on the force and download

300
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,209
let's say the main structure

301
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:34,730
but the fact remains that  however the

302
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,339
package that package proprietary

303
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,000
communication between devices with

304
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,680
specifications on the protocols so it is

305
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,870
in short it is essential here this is

306
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,550
an important point indispensable to

307
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,899
generate professions of more than 2

308
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:45,490
terabytes

309
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,149
if not you do not do it and use the cpt then

310
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,380
there is also the speech  on 11 of the

311
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,240
partitions that you can create all

312
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,800
these things here there is no more speech at the

313
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,450
party in the main bars expenses so

314
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,490
in short there are innovations and

315
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,320
this probably the

316
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,970
most visible innovation in some ways is in fact

317
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,310
when you load the partitions you take

318
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,870
to  sea maybe a gem even sent

319
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,130
the machine with windows 8 on went to

320
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,330
see that the situation partitions

321
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,770
you saw there is an esoteric partition

322
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,839
such as I don't know partition that people will read

323
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,550
later because the distribution of

324
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,330
these systems changes is both your book

325
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,700
manager attention f to your ebook

326
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,750
manager so not the group

327
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,370
theoretically should no longer be there

328
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,110
because you should have confiscated it

329
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,100
at the

330
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,510
he who defines the priorities

331
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,970
no and we will see then that this also of the

332
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,089
consequences makes it easier to

333
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:43,339
manage the PC servers remotely 15

334
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:44,420
having the drivers having everything

335
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,700
practically there is the possibility for the

336
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,279
constructor to update maybe bios or

337
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,260
to  do who knows what this then

338
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,000
only he knows because obviously being more

339
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,149
closed you cannot know what to do in the

340
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,910
future it should be open made of

341
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,010
putting new diagnostic

342
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,480
systems data recovery systems the services

343
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,490
that photographers and integrated functions for

344
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,839
the management of consumption and  so on all the

345
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,060
things that one can put in to those

346
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,410
belloli of these system expenses

347
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,029
operated  vo parallel that is underneath

348
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:14,709
us then we now want to see only

349
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:16,720
one aspect that of the second

350
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,999
so you see that the wi fi is a thousand things

351
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,429
behind and it is not all crap there

352
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:22,689
are also things that make sense

353
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:24,550
for which actually it becomes

354
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,259
quite difficult today to justify

355
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:28,839
not to continue without using the web, however,

356
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:30,249
inside there is this discourse of the secur

357
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,740
book that perhaps the most crucial point

358
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,639
of the whole matter

359
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,949
or as already said that they will be able to the

360
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:38,110
system we make sure to certify the

361
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,240
whole chain so that from the moment

362
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,069
you are leaving  the machine at the moment

363
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:46,329
it arrives running let's say your

364
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:48,279
login in your login page all the

365
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,220
chain siena certified chain

366
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,589
and here it enters all the stores if the

367
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:56,579
keys which is heavy enough because

368
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,559
why then the concept was to avoid

369
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,149
the famous all cool  and then it

370
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:03,009
means these virus programs that

371
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:05,050
could potentially lurk but

372
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,939
this is played with

373
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:10,720
scam mechanisms  key bi 5 o'clock when I

374
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,600
realized that he had put here a moment

375
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,089
only tries to solve how the fate of

376
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:17,589
keys done so

377
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,589
in practice there is within the web there is

378
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:23,860
a key that has been certified and

379
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,660
this certified key must be

380
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,339
then in the other modules so if you have

381
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,369
a boot manager it must be inside good

382
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:31,779
manager which must be its same

383
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:33,490
key that you have inside the web

384
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,249
then you must have it if you want to certify then

385
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,619
also certify the kernels because I

386
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:41,110
tension the web and in the specifications it does not

387
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,600
say that  it is mandatory to certify the

388
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,279
kernel and because they stop only at the first

389
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,619
stage practically because that of

390
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,879
let's say no longer becomes in quotation marks

391
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,860
relevance of del wef is part of

392
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,569
subsequent specifications potentially

393
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,839
so in fact you could also just

394
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,509
authenticate the boot manager enough at

395
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:04,299
this point then after d  'alia deletes the

396
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:06,040
justification the kernel and attention

397
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,509
there are also used more elements

398
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:08,019
of the caen

399
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,429
because if you have modules they must be

400
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:12,339
c  you also certify those not so it must

401
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,470
be all

402
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,120
digitally signed

403
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,610


404
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,100


405
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,660


406
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,939


407
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,480


408
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,270
stuff.  these manufacturers different

409
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,640
buildings according to you because they should

410
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,000
put the key of linux or

411
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,600
microsoft or any other manager

412
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,460
then microsoft we will see how to get

413
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,770
their key put in the

414
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,690
problem is that for there it is not much more

415
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,950
difficult to get myself  that you have

416
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,090
inside and we will see the effects that

417
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,120
this thing who manages the keys

418
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,480
this is not told at the web level

419
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,460
are in fact certain fiction authorities

420
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,340
so I would say that this is a

421
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,930
fairly obvious thing

422
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,700
then there is the concept I said

423
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,070
before having to sign the  modules that you also create

424
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,690
problems because you imagine having to

425
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,460
sign the modules for example that are

426
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,170
introduced d  to virtualbox or from

427
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,050
envy drivers or almost of this type

428
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,490
so there is also this problem is

429
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,870
that it is not a monolith with which I have to

430
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,900
do it is clear I can also very well

431
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,430
decide not to start my

432
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,410
consecutive system there is a sea without a second  you

433
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,330
is the problem does not exist then from that

434
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,750
point of view the manufacturer decides the

435
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,490
keys he wants to load so I have

436
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,780
produced hours it is I who decide the

437
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,330
keys I want to load and the over coat

438
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,520
how I do it there too is all to be

439
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,960
seen because now  then there are all

440
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,730
if the problem then maybe we also talk about

441
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,560
the motherboard that from you so on no

442
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,410
oh well the pc in the shopping malls

443
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,540
will have all the functions enabled

444
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,070
who or which I can tell of all

445
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,630
the colors because mounting renounces even

446
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,190
in the latest versions of I guarantee  that

447
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:57,390
you see of everything of everything third

448
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,050
protagonist

449
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,990
this is a logo that you find on the pc is not

450
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,160
exactly the same it is slightly different

451
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,270
compatible on the pc

452
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,570
if you want to see this pa  stooped

453
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,940
if you want the stamp the microsoft what does

454
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,130
it do you stick it says you can

455
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,220
certificate the

456
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,139
machine very well then I make

457
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,790
you the stamp you bring me the car and

458
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,579
I see if it meets the requirements it has given me

459
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,199
here is the nerve center of the

460
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,540
question the requirements  that

461
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,129
microsoft gave if you respect these

462
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:31,000
requirements I pay you so not only do you

463
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,709
bring me the car I say okay and then

464
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:34,269
you can attach your directives fries

465
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:36,370
of my windows 8 that to the pachino and

466
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,579
therefore it is certified but I also pay you

467
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:44,860
for this thing is  but obviously and

468
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,930
if you let him certify then what do you do I

469
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,959
sign the contract and first thing he

470
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,339
asks you to enter my

471
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:53,139
plan key then the microsoft key

472
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:56,259
in machines with windows 8 is necessarily

473
00:16:56,259 --> 00:17:00,879
there but there is not only that for example

474
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,920
I specify that you are smart it must

475
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,250
be active by default disabled

476
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,789
but active by default

477
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:14,619
this is a devastating thing because you

478
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,299
call a friend and tell him now you

479
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:18,010
put us on linux

480
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,339
see if he succeeds because he has to find out he

481
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,270
knows how to enter the setup is that there is no

482
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,780
standard button complaint in 70 of the

483
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,970
times or at the eye flash c is sees it in

484
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,350
some cases even with the fresh one with the

485
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,610
money nothing 20 shows  absolutely nothing

486
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,230
so it must go to google

487
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,900
give me model ac to the three press f2 then you

488
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,120
arrive at the 12 there is a writing that says

489
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,970
I want to go in mode if it is not curved

490
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,179
no there is in safety mode perhaps in the

491
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:48,250
version such as there is mode  or it

492
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,080
happens as a machine less

493
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,760
a brawl where there is

494
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,320
absolutely nothing written I say but how the hell

495
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,390
is I go to see on the internet purpose there

496
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,830
is no problem just put the password

497
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,320
in to enter the bios as soon as you put the

498
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,270
bios password  this you are able from the

499
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,070
writing that says with this then of the

500
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,860
veils alice coreboot [ __ ] how

501
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,710
did I do not think about it that is you see that is

502
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,899
unspeakable filth brought to normal

503
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:15,869
the second on arm to this cortege on

504
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:17,850
arm must be active not disabled at

505
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,690
all  on page that can be enabled because

506
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,679
security for all you know that there is

507
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,119
nothing more dangerous for

508
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:29,369
security than a weapon device I know from

509
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:32,279
what it did but I don't say at least I think I

510
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,600
know why it did it

511
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,100
probably because if they had ever

512
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,690
done the  same thing on this side

513
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,279
what abuse of dominant position was

514
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,009
certainly no here they do not have a

515
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:42,960
dominant position to a residual situation

516
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,950
consequently potentially it becomes

517
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,570
difficult to sustain what you

518
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:55,109
look at here the problem is also this

519
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:57,779
that here the problem is that these things

520
00:18:57,779 --> 00:18:59,820
just change every two  days not

521
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,200
we will see it for example with

522
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,940
linux distributions these things change in languages

523
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,929
days for that problem is also that

524
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:05,970
days even if very informed about

525
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,649
what is happening because the

526
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:13,850
casino is happening now and linux

527
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:18,139
this was the first

528
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:20,279
justified reaction the first to  be

529
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:22,379
justified because it creates a mess

530
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,570
because there the very fact that linux

531
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,269
is by its nature does not mo  nolitico is a

532
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,429
mess to be able to donate one says oh well I do not

533
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:31,200
activate the security systems but in the meantime

534
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,480
an excellent one arrives by default

535
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,399
then I go to explain to your friend them who

536
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:37,710
says scott a migliaccio windows 8 and

537
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,509
I want to put on linux

538
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:42,659
no eh well disability security but

539
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:45,629
how  linux was not a safe system

540
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:48,119
I have to disable the security to

541
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:51,690
start my system I don't even think about it

542
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,309
but to explain the easy concept it

543
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:55,619
says exclusion concentrated with the

544
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:58,080
easy concepts the easy concept I

545
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,609
take away the security for the security

546
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:04,870
they want to explain if  you are a man then

547
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,540
what happened this was the first

548
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,160
who ventured into this

549
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,830
fedora thing that obviously and to the

550
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,390
distribution we say that then also

551
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,360
that of reda practically the first

552
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,590
who faced the problem saying

553
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,030
in short somehow to solve

554
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,460
this problem what  did they

555
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,340
bought the doctors key you

556
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,059
can't imagine but the fact is that

557
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,380
whoever made that choice was not

558
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,620
ac  retino is one that has not found other

559
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,160
solutions

560
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,010
and the problem is probably other

561
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,960
better solutions right now

562
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,380
maybe there aren't any

563
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,880
debian ones and since 2013 they are

564
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,460
fighting over deciding what to do

565
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,929
they still haven't supported because they don't know

566
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,790
what to do because  probably this

567
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,950
right now is crap but

568
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,179
probably the only solution

569
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:54,160
right now because microsoft has a

570
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,740
passive quoted system of

571
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,770
keys for who are the manufacturers who

572
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,970
have to sell the car with the

573
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,559
bologna it is turkey fault above so it

574
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,090
is they who are  go get it key

575
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,460
no you can't do the same thing with

576
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:06,880
linux

577
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,510
so this is a mess and therefore

578
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,370
how obviously a popular revolt arose

579
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,780
after which after the first

580
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,540
moments of td of anguish discussion

581
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,890
etc. they realized that

582
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,090
actually it is not a

583
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,390
rash choice  let's say it was a bad

584
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,860
horrible choice but it was not a windy choice

585
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,920
of 99 from the dc meeting you want I

586
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,450
understand eg  riodi sell a key that

587
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,760
attention can also change because if

588
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,559
microsoft decides to revoke its

589
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,510
key because actually even in

590
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,190
good faith a cazzaro took it at

591
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,260
all disasters no I am forced to

592
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,940
change the key I trigger the

593
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,800
mechanisms because web to allow a way

594
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,059
to make  trigger

595
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:44,650
key change mechanisms change the key

596
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,860
immediately placed there it no longer works

597
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,929
no after which you too will have to chase

598
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:51,250
the change of the call in linux

599
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,630
etcetera treta and if a war happens

600
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,830
that I block all the PCs because I

601
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,520
change you clear it is not a thing to do

602
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,710
little

603
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,750
fedora filmaker in and modules with skis but

604
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,890
now let's see what this

605
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,680
came out one is practically it is accompanied

606
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,210
not done the same practically it was

607
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,770
a later invention that they

608
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,690
sought a little bit of let's say to

609
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,240
find the pieces in quotation marks we need

610
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,580
the wedge is  practically what they have

611
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,380
done from the moment in which the

612
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,450
system part from the choral moment goes to load

613
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,860
the lo  g manager basically loads a little

614
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,840
program that he manages the keys and

615
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,310
that he goes to insert because there is the

616
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,780
possibility for a little program to

617
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,250
go and change the key never serious his

618
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,940
keys of practically fedora inside

619
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,640
the web

620
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,810
and after which he continues with those of

621
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,950
fedora which is a bit of a spin

622
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,330
and so on but let's say that it is a

623
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,560
little more tolerable situation

624
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,940
because at that point the management of the

625
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,260
glass keys but the golden key

626
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,700
obviously this thing has to do a little bit of

627
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,850
all of the man later after

628
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,050
everyone has it  said of all colors

629
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,920
some point ubuntu also had to

630
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,910
move on this plane because they too

631
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,590
felt the need to do

632
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,030
this thing because the problem is that the

633
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,460
machine move in all of them like this and therefore

634
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,960
it started first to see if there is a

635
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,520
loophole they have not found a

636
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,290
loophole does not pull unfortunately said

637
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,390
the way is that there we are

638
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,580
forced not to take it key from microsoft

639
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,960
and it does the same thing s  and not that they

640
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,880
discovered a catch that since cru 2

641
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,580
had to have it digitally signed if

642
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,980
you went to see practically the gbl

643
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,510
there was a fairly questionable point of sale

644
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,070
because you in fact do not

645
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,680
distribute the source as it was but

646
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,810
manageable with the key attached

647
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,140
microsoft for which in fact it was not all

648
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,300
transparent so disputes could arise

649
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,890
and a discussion was born for

650
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,180
which in the end they are even allowed to

651
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,150
do something other than cranes 2

652
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,310
precisely because now me what did not

653
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,110
have

654
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,880
anyway let's say we did something

655
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,120
different from q2 on purpose  to avoid

656
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,130
running into problems of this type if

657
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,290
the wrath of god was unleashed because it is a point

658
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,940
they were not just any institution it was

659
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,620
practically the most widespread and

660
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,590
consequently free software foundation that

661
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,030
she who who has the gpa of which

662
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,299
practically manages in fact has  said

663
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,760
but as abandoned you can not use it

664
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,960
for that absolutely there are no

665
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,280
problems from this type

666
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,809
from this p  anointed of view etc. so

667
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:20,880
there was a return back no

668
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,410
point and then clearly at the end

669
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,179
all the peace and love but an endless war was born

670
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:24,960


671
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,730
if this thing here then arrived I think of

672
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,410
sousse begins with the

673
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,090
braille version the tete a tete  same

674
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,400
key microsoft loading a

675
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,290
library of keys into sci because

676
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,460
he said well in short, the idea of the

677
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,950
disciplines bad but perhaps made a

678
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,120
little better you could make a

679
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,790
library of practical keys the

680
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,059
oedipal speakers database declare is so

681
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,890
beautiful that at a certain point fedora  he says

682
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,150
well you did a good thing we too do

683
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:51,570


684
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,900
not it is practically the situation more or

685
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,290
less this conclusion

686
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,780
we go on finally the

687
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,360
cutter that fondation moved and what did he

688
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,740
scrutinized he wanted to exploit a

689
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,530
specification after all this practically

690
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,440
exists the possibility  potentially

691
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,960
to start a coreboot system in itself and

692
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,760
deny it a moment later that is to say

693
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,730
since I see that the step suc  cessivo

694
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,740
is not authorized no because

695
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,020
it is actually not digitally signed

696
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,120
if you want to go straight I press the

697
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,549
function key from such no that says go

698
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:31,980
on the same I don't give a damn

699
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,169
and practically they managed and in fact

700
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:37,410
they are made sheen them no with

701
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,790
this  option for the attention that

702
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,020
this option is excluded within the

703
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,080
famous microsoft certifications which

704
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,120
instead says you can not do

705
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,740
moreover that the situation for which in

706
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,150
fact the moment in which you speak so the

707
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,669
second you as not even there was for which

708
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:55,470
in fact those  all the vague mosaic

709
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,360
security chain in short it is a

710
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,860


711
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,320
devia debian casino imagine having to

712
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,240
take the key of marx that is one

713
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,380
thing in itself if you go to see the

714
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,970
presentation of colangelo the end says

715
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,080
that the distribution of vip is a

716
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,640
differently fast distribution

717
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,600
obviously we have  all maximum

718
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,549
respective this is supported on debian

719
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:20,280
but the fact remains that having to digest

720
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,870
the fact of taking it never ask  so

721
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,309
said it is not a very easy thing in

722
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:24,960
conclusion they do not support it yet they

723
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,540
support wife i no but they are not

724
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:32,340
willing to endure according to the result

725
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,879
this graph

726
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,309
obviously this graph someone

727
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:39,690
anyone of you could do it in your own way

728
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,580


729
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,570
never do it on the graph absolutely

730
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,429
relevant as it cannot be demonstrated

731
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:45,690
the result of conjectures of my sick mind

732
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,860


733
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,440
then it is the concept is this this is

734
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,910
the percentage of users who are

735
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,190
able to move to mount linux by

736
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,340
themselves no I which dates you can not

737
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,720
move but in any case the concept is

738
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,919
this you know that there  he gave the

739
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,559
wages not on a decrepit car

740
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,690
we were also on a 486 he called me a

741
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,750
loser

742
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,680
and yet I don't tell you the miners the hardships

743
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,150
because there was no my technique face of

744
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,040
life there was nothing that 2t wifi does not exist

745
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,700
it is practically a delusion so the

746
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,020
older the car, the more it struggles

747
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,010
because at the beginning there was no

748
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,710
problems and then later the drivers

749
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,480
began to have  there were the

750
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,620
last drivers that gave some

751
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,670
problems were for example those of

752
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,740
the video cards then there are the keys

753
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,570
for what I do

754
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,040
the bevels because everything seemed to

755
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,300
be fine then the

756
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,160
keys came out and usually that was the

757
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,290
problem they had  all no

758
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,220
then now the problem of the keys is also solved they

759
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,020
solve the problem

760
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,940
finally they are installing the machines

761
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,390
of the last 5 6 years but we say as

762
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,920
soon as they are bought and looking for no problem

763
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,150
in my opinion it was the machine just

764
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,890
bought they are silent in the use husband

765
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:52,970
next to one  out of ten for printing one out of

766
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,610
ten and this is not a small problem

767
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,620
because at the moment people do not

768
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,420
pay much attention to it because they are re-

769
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,320
conditioning old machines but whoever

770
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,080
finds himself installing linux a

771
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,870
new machine has the problem and how

772
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,670
and here the problem is big it must

773
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,740
be solved in some way the

774
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,270
problem is that not only do you see a

775
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,590
solution because at this moment  the

776
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,840
solution we should not give it to us

777
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,580
should be that famous power

778
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,710
supply you saw at the beginning where at a

779
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,470
certain point the international techno intervenes

780
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,300
that says them white

781
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,050
nothing

782
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:40,490
at this point the problem is big and

783
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,350
big is the only solution what it

784
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,660
could be  to buy machines

785
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:49,130
without the windows 8 patch 18.0

786
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,640
if you find it we have found another

787
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,480
disability solution in the following but

788
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,620
you must be able to make people understand

789
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,050
that the tory alemi those

790
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,260
safety mechanisms is not to remove the safety and

791
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,200
this is another problem  not just

792
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,610
the other possibility the moment in which I

793
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,080
entered with this mechanism of the

794
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,430
century butini then inserted in a

795
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,170
hitch is because for example I have

796
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,660
the habit of putting two

797
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,800
linux distributions side by

798
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,420
side so that I know  asked the

799
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,370
projector then I started with the other one and

800
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,690
went to see it because you share the disc

801
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,720
what happened that

802
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,160
practically if I did it, parts

803
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,330
c  follows a hole and after one does not

804
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,060
see stuff the others and so on

805
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,580
no then a thousand other problems then

806
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,200
derived from the fact of a

807
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,880
push safety system because this

808
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,770
push safety system justified in

809
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,460
certain environments is justified then two

810
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,050
three things that I will show you  as a

811
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,440
consequence of this thing here I will

812
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,800
show you for example this now I

813
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,030
am not extracted a bit from my blog

814
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:55,670
the goal on let's say problems and we

815
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,230
love each other more from the new technologies I know that

816
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:57,950
in the stands

817
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,750
certainly never seen but then

818
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,830
ok

819
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,169
but let's see there  the water in here

820
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:16,520
I am brought so why so I

821
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,970
do not even need to connect with

822
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,490
here it is if then this is fine it is

823
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,549
also up to those eight players then

824
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:29,150
never the with the open files are those

825
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:33,850
it does not then disc give you s

826
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:39,240
but this this  ok this

827
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:42,640
then of the center so

828
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:52,110
then we see again you are coming

829
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,260
ok if you see it here I will show you

830
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,910
for example what happened with

831
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,980
hewlett packa windows 8 and pa  ck also the stories

832
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,630
of ordinaries and protections but the story of

833
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,100
when I went to recondition an

834
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,130
epaca machine beautiful fast villas

835
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:10,140
of angel and music hall a minute away

836
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,120
then I didn't understand anything when

837
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,670
I was very fast practically this

838
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,770
machine here after unspeakable problems

839
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,090
at the end  v6 discoveries with a bang not

840
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,710
deactivated anything you went to

841
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,929
install linux that of the versions that

842
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:24,000
support the second one entered

843
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,320
everything perfectly

844
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,640
if you did a showdown as soon as

845
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,750
you did the show giving at that moment you

846
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,870
kept errors at the start

847
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,790
because it said like the processor or something

848
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,320
like this  like if you want to go go and

849
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,860
read

850
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,270
there is the detail of the whole thing how it

851
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,190
went i tried to give back the

852
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,600
car dealer told me

853
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,400
you can't see it back because the di

854
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,410
changed the operating system or look for

855
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,330
i called the brawl beautiful  pat slime

856
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,000

857
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,260
problem of your wef that does

858
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,360
cazz  ate response to the packard bell

859
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,010
we do not give assistance on the machines

860
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,299
where you have that puts the operating system

861
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,040
but excuse a moment I am not

862
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,720
asking you for assistance on windows 8 I

863
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,220
am asking you for assistance on the wi fi that

864
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,059
you wrote that makes cassate

865
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:04,740
here is this  here is another another

866
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,150
was with him a detach the two packs

867
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,890
what does he do we said that the groove

868
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,049
decides which partition is the

869
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:12,570
group that finally the group does not manage it at the

870
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,950
level of the

871
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,809
perfect web then I say I want to start

872
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:19,230
the first one  you can not because the function

873
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,390
inside the west that says which is the

874
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,919
operating system the game before did

875
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,470
not put it there because windows must start

876
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,600
but you can do fe no me if

877
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,640
you do f9 you can say that within

878
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,110
that list  there is the groove and start

879
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:34,380
the group that makes you start and this is

880
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,850
all that happens to hand over

881
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,590
the management of the web both of the companies

882
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,080
that give you in the third of the I have not

883
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,290
yet seen a screen of the setup that

884
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,030
allow you to go to command lines and

885
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,910
put your hand on the web that

886
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:51,210
is potentially there so practically gave me a

887
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,860
pig in a poke someone who manages

888
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,610
it as you please

889
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,220
this is reality and you don't even

890
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:56,990
know what

891
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,630
we guarantee an apple supply chain

892
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,510
poisoned or potentially belen to you it

893
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,470
's okay to

894
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,240
close the matter and if you want to go and

895
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,250
see on the site and I also made a

896
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,250
small one that I called the wifi at the cup

897
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,960
nefarious where I tried to explain in

898
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,690
human terms for people not of the

899
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,440
trade

900
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,600
no the question but not  it is easy to explain

901
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,040
why it is complicated

902
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,350
I hope you need something for the

903
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,970
rest I leave room for the logical one

904
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,460
I apologize if I stole games
