1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
so good morning this is the last talk

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,620
combine after thousand euros from the boxes you do not

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,970
see lead what we see today is

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:15,680
the open source project of an Englishman

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,189
who then translated an Australian into the

6
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:26,250
base and who only sells

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,349
the base for free so the components you have to

8
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,750
buy veils  you to make an efficient

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:39,239
and interesting hf transceiver the

10
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,070
very old project because of 2002

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,960
2003 but still very active now

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,390
so there are many people who

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,670
work behind it for example they have made

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,410
an algorithm to remove the noise that

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,530
came out just two three weeks ago  where

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,690
they say that basically you do not hear that

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,480
noise when turning that is it gives you the idea that

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,880
you are without antennas attached in reality as

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,260
soon as there is a useful signal I have heard it

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,380
is still an SDR this is the

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,460
block diagram that you will certainly not see well

22
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,570
because  unfortunately this is the size of

23
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,369
a series of filters so a first

24
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:22,700
conversion to a filter means that the

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,580
part here is a part of the procedure

26
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,860
ssore sorry this the dsp will go there

27
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,869
is not yet the pro with the software so by

28
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:36,080
modifying the software it sends change of

29
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,840
sp these are the three reception

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,920
so each band decided the filter

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,740
what you see above a

32
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,479
microprocessor that controls everything that

33
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,850
is that  of the hardware the wide in the

34
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,420
one from the largest one the

35
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,590
sorry I don't get the name 10 56 I

36
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,440
'm wrong the one that has the most fins

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:13,450
ever of the gods the

38
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,880
and in essence this is the a of the ds and

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,530
automatically you have the receiver the

40
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,820
transceiver done  this is one

41
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,320
of the great implementations that have

42
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,240
been made the advantage of this

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,940
project is that it is customizable

44
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,190
so there are those who choose this display that

45
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,950
can be touch and for which you have all the

46
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,070
parameters on the screen so to choose

47
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,180
display type with 16 characters 2duerighe

48
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,200
that you see classically on the picks and of

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,390
course you will have less information and

50
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,790
also all the part of monopolistic

51
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,010
buttons s customizable for which

52
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,459
you can choose  how many knobs to want

53
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:07,720
or how much information to give and now

54
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,010
we go to see the site so we see

55
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,239
some information

56
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,100
indeed no because there is no internet connection

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,160


58
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,379
no

59
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,210
no

60
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:37,480
well then this is another

61
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:56,299
interesting other that you can see

62
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:12,990
this is another type of radio  in

63
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,699
reality, tonight we have always

64
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,289
amounted differently because the

65
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,430
imagination of those who mount goes a little and in my opinion the

66
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,759
most beautiful

67
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,759
one must be very good

68
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,969
mechanically this for example

69
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,330
another type as you can see without

70
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,340
knobs and buttons and lastly that

71
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:42,509
without making you lose  time is this here is

72
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:45,240
the most beautiful ever from

73
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,710
an aesthetic point of view

74
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:55,050
let's see if one arrives what is the church is

75
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,969
a cash more a pc solo remade

76
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:02,159
he has cut out and remade the part

77
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:06,539
in fact if you go and see here you will notice

78
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:10,949
that  it has something of a pc the solos

79
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,409
remade let's say the front has cut

80
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:21,710
the power this

81
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,180
the most beautiful and implementation has done

82
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,490
well it is made by a Japanese this

83
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,140
qu  ello that you see of the display

84
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,730
during reception are all the values that

85
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,650
are the size of the filter the

86
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,310
frequency the florist b and all the

87
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,200
parameters if you put the touchscreen

88
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,180
you can click directly here

89
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,620
otherwise the buttons externally it is

90
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,390
done so it looks almost like a

91
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,120
commercial radio because actually  well

92
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,530
done there are questions about this they

93
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,690
are all implemented on the board

94
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:02,930
that is the pins that now all can be

95
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,480
put on them not to put them exactly or

96
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,070
fix them with the existence

97
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,660
depends on the display has a card

98
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,540
on this but it already hooks here and

99
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,140
already has  predisposed

100
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,000
enough basically then being

101
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,170
free software someone can implement

102
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,000
something more things less the

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,320
difference is that it is something

104
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,030
hardware becomes more difficult now that

105
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,210
the base is made this is the fourth

106
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,460
version that is made because

107
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,169
once it was all on one  larger base

108
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,370


109
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,620
this time they did not split in two and

110
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:46,530
so a little smaller no this came

111
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,960
first  to media filter conversion with

112
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,710
low frequency version of st this

113
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,580
let's say more classic than dsp

114
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,160
direct connection the prices are this here as

115
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,960
components one thing and the other evening

116
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:08,620
the 2 300 euros plus display is more the

117
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,820
box that is here if you buy the

118
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,200
coupon that has seen before the

119
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,440
smallest is 800 dollars for excellent

120
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080
also the box amplifier

121
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,790
but if already able to filters that

122
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,000
this already other questions

123
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,200
I have finished us a little more boxes

124
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,220
thanks to all

125
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,920
any questions you find me in loves

126
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,520
around  she
