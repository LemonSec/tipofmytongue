1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:04,140
here we are then I said we are here to

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,490
present linux is a wireless

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,370
community network born in rome precisely fa

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,250
bis came from dani nuxe rome i am from

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,610
linux verona the idea is to create a

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,150
new network etc. and we create it a bit

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,850
according to our canons a bit  like how

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,800
we like to do because someone would

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,529
want to make a new network for example

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,480
because we like to tinker we can

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,510
be precisely have the passion of

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,640
systems engineers linux ari programmatore

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,370
even if the radio amateurs and want to

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,750
do our thing that works under

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,480
our control to play a  po

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,160
or to have more performance type if

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,219
we want to make a connection between us

18
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,190
and our friend in another neighborhood

19
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,360
passing for example on a

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,090
game server in australia the performances

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,039
will be painful by making a

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,420
direct connection we cannot

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,420
have both more bandwidth and less  latency

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,309
or we can do it for activism for

25
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,188
example I consider it a way to

26
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,750
actively defend the freedom of

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,540
communication  nor, that is, not on such a network,

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,900
we can prevent

29
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,430
what we do not like from

30
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,230
happening that happens on the internet, for example, the

31
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,000
shutdown of the internet as in the

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,520
Arab springs but also obama wants the

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,730
possibility of being able to do

34
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,350
it censorship we can study a network

35
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,000
in which  it is impossible to censor it is

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,070
impossible to turn off in which the

37
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,229
network neutrality is

38
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:36,070
guaranteed enough by design in which the

39
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,229
physical structure and also the management is not

40
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,150
hierarchical like the one we see on the

41
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,280
internet but is carried out from below in

42
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,170
an equal way and obviously use

43
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,970
an open source software  if these

44
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,020
are our reasons

45
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,340
or we could do it out of paranoia

46
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,080
create our servers with our

47
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,110
open source software to instead of

48
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,790
sending our data to the cloud

49
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,619
take back control of our data

50
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,720
and also of the communication line on

51
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,670
these data transit we can also do it

52
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,258
for  civil protection we have an

53
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,899
example in linux in reggio

54
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,620
Calabria of one of our friends who is

55
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,690
trying to make a linux network

56
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,640
resistant to earthquakes therefore

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,709
battery packs that last that keep

58
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,739
the device on for tens of hours

59
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:25,440
solar panels and things like that

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,790
or against the digital divide for

61
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,330
example a person in a village  of

62
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,070
mountain expects a

63
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,989
commercial provider to bring him the commission

64
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,880
could wait tens of years I

65
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,380
just need to put an antenna pointing

66
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,030
towards the city and its connection

67
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,730
less because the provider follows

68
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,860
commercial logic that

69
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,299
will never make it convenient to go to the

70
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,560
mountains to bring  a cable ok how

71
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,959
can we make the network and let's say that the

72
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,540
network the network and passes by as

73
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,310
definition

74
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,250
comes from the bottom and starts from a group of

75
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,930
people in fact they are called wireless

76
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,450
community so at the base it is not so much

77
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,020
the network but as the people in

78
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,780
what the network must be according to

79
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,930
our point of view has

80
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,540
shared ownership everyone must be the master

81
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,459
manager of the p  roprio node therefore there is

82
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,760
no mr linux that one day someone

83
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,319
can go intercom to mr linux

84
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,170
ask and ask let's say explanations

85
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,690
and therefore as such how inter works

86
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,860
is based on a very

87
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,830
fundamental principle that collaboration there

88
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,350
are group decision-making dynamics is

89
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,569
in  this environment

90
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:44,830
let's say the network is born in these

91
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,810
interconnections of personal relationships

92
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,299
even more you need the network for

93
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:51,549
your own network to talk in short for with di

94
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:53,920
for it therefore shares the two the two

95
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,319
concepts of community and networking

96
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,870
feed each other as we

97
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,760
said  from a practical point of view

98
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,940
we put devices on our roofs

99
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,570
we can also put them on the balconies but

100
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:15,000
we prefer the roofs because the network

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,790
must and spread go definition so

102
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,970
have maximum visibility on when it is

103
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,899
possible

104
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,320
around the point where

105
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,050
the node is installed will allow the network  of

106
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,350
ladder to climb and you climb on the roofs

107
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:38,120
in this also quite pioneering

108
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,010
you use  licenses are used

109
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,710
devices that use free frequencies

110
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:50,400
so the 2 gb 4 the 5 gb or even

111
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,580
if you want even the 17 giga from the last from

112
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,040
the legislative point of view has been removed

113
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
and the constraint of crossing

114
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,840
the private land so it is possible to

115
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,630
pass  on the sun on public land and

116
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,510
therefore it has become in effect

117
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,310
let's say legal first there is a

118
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,590
regulatory hole with the latest

119
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,540
communications code this situation has been remedied

120
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,430
and therefore it is possible to

121
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,470
connect with wireless bridges even

122
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,780
between private excesses

123
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:29,790
our homes ok this is this was

124
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,540
one of this is a work of art

125
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,970
the work given in the garden with which

126
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,720
an access point was placed but man, however,

127
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,190
let's say that we use these devices

128
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,180
more or less than the ubiquitous of the micro

129
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,020
tico any vendor for they have an

130
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,760
excellent value for money so they

131
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,220
are quite cheap

132
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,080
in the end when building a node

133
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,000
the most expensive part is not so much

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,100
the antenna as the wiring the p  ane

135
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,530
tie rods all the carpentry that we

136
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,000
do not want to go to the roof every day to

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,280
fix but making a knot that lasts over

138
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,610
time is something to be done click

139
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,630
the experience you also learn to do here

140
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,240
and now the software part or rather the

141
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,430
firmware continues I just in  these

142
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,710
antennas are

143
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,590
real routers year of the

144
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,560
proprietary firmware of 15 euro s micro tic

145
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,880
router ose so on

146
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,520
and however to make

147
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,349
a mesh network we need and say

148
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:47,200
open we also need

149
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,350
to be able to fiddle around because it

150
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,870
could be done  everything with rob is

151
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,790
proprietary but that is not the

152
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,360
spirit so devices are based most

153
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,990
of the time there is open caps

154
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,790
which allows us to install all a

155
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,190
series of particular utilities those

156
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,740
for routing because it is not that we say the

157
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,470
routing part must be done in

158
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,270
intelligent automatic mode the network must

159
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,530
learn by itself to vote

160
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:21,220
ok and then obviously it must be configured everything must be

161
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,500
configured on this as

162
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,170
obviously the obie  It is not effective to make the

163
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,440
network only between super technicians super

164
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,400
geeks the various islands to the various groups

165
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,780
therefore the various groups

166
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,640
also work to customize the

167
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,200
god firmware for derivatives from a

168
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,720
guerretti of the pre-configurations

169
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,880
according to their island and therefore

170
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,680
also facilitate those who are  first weapons to

171
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,770
install their own node and among the

172
00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:00,040
many let's say 33 many versions of open

173
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,500
boretti we tell us this project

174
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,640
that gets sick pre match involving

175
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,680
both linux and wi fi that in another wants to

176
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,840
bet on catalonia or argentine alter match

177
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,570
and want to talk  all fish

178
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,040
ok

179
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,420
in a nutshell how much we are this

180
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,100
is a typical example of an area of a

181
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,270
mesh network

182
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:33,219
we do not say full match so not

183
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:35,229
all common calls with all

184
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,770
we assume that there is that the node from the

185
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,960
arrow I want to reach the resource

186
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,190
that is there  it is in the red dot that any resource that is

187
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,890
started ok the

188
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,360
routing protocol finds the

189
00:08:52,360 --> 00:09:00,670
best way and reaches its destination the network

190
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,340
to be  we say yes how the network

191
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,770
wanted in dynamic some no later it can

192
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,680
have a faith it can be switched off then

193
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,450
the routing protocol re converges

194
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,440
finds its way again and with a time that

195
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,430
depends on

196
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,620
the type of protocol used by the

197
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,720
performances it reaches

198
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,580
its destination again  it stopped ok

199
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,820
so I have what software manage the

200
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,380
routing each island let's say as a

201
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,100
linux project maximum freedom in the sense that

202
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,560
beyond the rules that you find dark on

203
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,740
our site to start a

204
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,510
wireless committee that are let's say

205
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,210
such as adhesion to the pico peering

206
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:57,300
agreement and  the open manifest let's say

207
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,820
there are not every community decides the

208
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,260
protocol to be used

209
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,300
within its own island so it can use or

210
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:09,330
lsr batman bmx babel is the only

211
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,880
thing that if the islands have to talk

212
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,500
it has to find a common protocol and

213
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,570
in our case, let's say no, the way of

214
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,600
art has been used for the

215
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,130
islands that we want to interconnect

216
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,970
using let's say internet

217
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,660
uti  we lizziamo bgp using tunnels

218
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,640
in how many today as configured years

219
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,550
nuxe linux type in rome florence and cosenza

220
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,730
we use all sr then

221
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,060
routing protocol so we are at layer 3 level

222
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,440
with two customization the names from us

223
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,310
picturesque smurato nor fart 1 and

224
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,100
derives from the aero sdk  and if when he

225
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,410
released it again then modified then

226
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,710
he stopped releasing it and then we

227
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,800
start configuring the nodes with a

228
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,910
customized version of open vlt

229
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,700
codenamed fart in pisa use

230
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,670
batman which is a

231
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,590
second level mesh protocol so it works at

232
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,250
level  max in verona bologna mesh book

233
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,520
and at the moment the islands are there is a

234
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,440
think-type vpn that

235
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,130
is in rome there is server st romeo

236
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,990
we all say all the other servers of the

237
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,420
strange vpn everyone is an island and we

238
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,380
exchange routes

239
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,910
obviously there are no dp conflicts

240
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,290
although we use

241
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:43,240
private addresses libre match which uses well then

242
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,250
free in the closed two

243
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,910
routing protocols at the two uses ba  tman banque syz

244
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,070
that precisely at the year I have to say that

245
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,050
routing based on mac addresses

246
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,329
completely difficult to remember there is

247
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:59,290
layer 3 if there is ipv4 ipv6 is the same

248
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,589
and we use

249
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:04,149
this for example in the philosophy of books and never

250
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:06,339
used at  inside a group of

251
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:08,170
fairly connected nodes that can be seen

252
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,420
quite well with each other both

253
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,279
locally,

254
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,290
the interesting thing is that precisely all

255
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,329
the clients that connect to a

256
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:18,800


257
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,140
group of wireless devices that

258
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,330
use batman advanced as

259
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,209
a routing protocol turn out to be

260
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,880
in the same as if they were attached

261
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,529
to a network switch that is to say they are seen

262
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:33,470
directly at a distance therefore

263
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,200
all kind of more local sailing all

264
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,930
these things work as if we were

265
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,269
attached directly or at most a

266
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:43,029
switch and even broadcasts travel less

267
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,360
and the problem of  batman that it seems that

268
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,089
in the memory of the devices there can be

269
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:51,829
at most type up to a thousand

270
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:53,420
nodes which is a dimension that for now

271
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,029
I don't care, however, the firmware is

272
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:58,279
designed to scale better up to

273
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,089
larger numbers

274
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:01,790
so another

275
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,250
routing protocol is added which is bmx 6

276
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,740
this time it is at layer 3 and in fact it is

277
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,320
used to group various

278
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,640
local batman islands by

279
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,620
making this game in which  we install

280
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,459
bmx 6 on the devices on the border

281
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:20,720
between the two between the two groups it is only

282
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,420
batman within each group

283
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,010
we can get a network that scales

284
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,930
enormous dimensions such as those of the

285
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,980
internet in short ok the network scales well

286
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,220
then for example why should I do myself

287
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,709
linux what services can you give me of sounds

288
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:39,320
nuxe makes the network that is our purpose is to

289
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,800
create the network so it

290
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,899
may not have anyone it

291
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:47,029
may not have services the services that

292
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:48,980
are there are those who decide to

293
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,790
put in the participants for example they

294
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,420
can  there are shared folders

295
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,160
can store my data on

296
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,470
my friend's server that has more

297
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,870
disk space I can have backups spread

298
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,630
over several co  mputer within the

299
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,640
network and taking advantage of the low latency

300
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,890
I can have game servers I can

301
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,019
host local TV radios that

302
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:16,730
want to stream from their headquarters

303
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,089
or from an event around the

304
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:22,339
city using the coverage that linux provides

305
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,860
in some  cities like rome can

306
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,690
stream using our network

307
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,130
without putting us with the

308
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,709
phone keys or you can do voip you

309
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:31,660
can be there

310
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,850
by email in chat video conferences

311
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,290
precisely videoconference because we have

312
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,690
a good band these antennas

313
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,760
we use have wireless n so in

314
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,220
theory we have  a nice band another

315
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,840
interesting thing to have interesting services

316
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,000
at a local level i.e. for

317
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,490
example local social networks or

318
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,340
tools for collaborative writing

319
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,860
one of the services if someone

320
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,960
shares access to the internet but it may not

321
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,020
be there if none of these

322
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,970
nodes of the  network advertises itself as the gateway

323
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,100
to go on the internet connection  the

324
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,050
internet is not there is our network remains

325
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,380
separate other services limited to the

326
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,040
imagination I connect to what

327
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,470
ilario said before so the purpose of inter di

328
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,750
linux is not to bring the internet because

329
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,910
it does not aim

330
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:24,370
to replace itself with an isp then and  this is

331
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,920
the first misunderstanding when but why

332
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,580
should I do when maybe I talk to

333
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,860
someone let's say don't convince him but

334
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,530
I have to talk to you about linux we said that the

335
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,300
internet is well reported at home

336
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,740
no it's no because it's another spirit

337
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,019
indeed there

338
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,899
may be useful maybe then you see not

339
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,610
how could it be a network where

340
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,879
you want sky I can transport like

341
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,459
sky at home the house at home in the country

342
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:59,139
I don't have it ok I put the sky transport node on it

343
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:02,199
and then the rules towards

344
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:06,699
let's say towards the

345
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,089
inside decide the community of which  above for

346
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:14,860
example in pisa in pisa absolutely not in

347
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,589
florence in florence on the mistress florence

348
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:18,970
absolutely not

349
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,600
in rome it depends on the community you go

350
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,029
customs you find

351
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:29,860
let's say it's not it's not a point of  the fact

352
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:36,639
is that being a network and in the

353
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,779
case of rome

354
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:41,379
we say a fairly large network

355
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:43,089
we are also very rich we say we are

356
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,600
known in the context of rome and

357
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,029
we have managed to enter the nup

358
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:52,440
in rome at the namex

359
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,010
as we have public ip available

360
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,870
we have  the possibility of

361
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,240
announcing them and then peering

362
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,660
peering with other networks other networks which

363
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,670
in the case of Rome are on the root server

364
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,730
type content manager type contender

365
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,380
network type google to karaj or

366
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,209
we have with research networks and

367
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:20,060
this following we see why

368
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,319
we fortunately also have the

369
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,569
possibility of having

370
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:28,019
a pool a 48 bar of ipv6 so it is

371
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:30,720
someone who gives us cipher from upstream

372
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,399
tv6 in ipv6 and therefore from the point of view

373
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:39,570
in the ipv6 network we are a piece of

374
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,360
internet in ipv6 because we

375
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,820
also have public addresses ipv6  and

376
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:52,889
anyway in rome a public ipv6 or in addition

377
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:54,570
to the network what the community does the community

378
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,110


379
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,269
I speak to you from the experience of rome but in

380
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:59,490
any case also the  and other communities of

381
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,690
firenze di pisa we

382
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,870
develop open source projects type no

383
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,139
of shock which is also developed in

384
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:09,440
collaboration with google summer of code

385
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,100
of google books match with having been

386
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,129
developed some plug in of hall sr

387
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:21,269
we do mentoring training of courses

388
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:23,519
or in ours  thursday nerd doing

389
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,070
tutorials these things here

390
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:32,039
this year linux is part of the god is

391
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,950
part of the project is part of the

392
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,860
research project with find which is a

393
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,799
European project that uses the

394
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,929
European wireless communities to build test beds

395
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:48,269
for research in the field  of

396
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:50,820
networking so instead of researchers

397
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,970
do tests on simulated networks they

398
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,340
can test on

399
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,080
real networks networks are those

400
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,809
of wireless communities maybe the

401
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,059
details of this project with find

402
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,610
maybe those interested in power we

403
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,140
can talk about it at our banquet

404
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:14,370
we are always there and  Legal After As

405
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,850
I mentioned earlier there is a collection of

406
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,610
laws advice how to argue with and

407
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,649
the condo administrator  minio in on

408
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:23,880
our site

409
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,260
so a little bit of a map hurts

410
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,070
no because we say these devices are

411
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,610
low power they have the final 27 of bm and

412
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,669
are very directive so even the

413
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:45,000
mobile phone reaches 32 but let's say about

414
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,610
thirty dbm and there  we stuck to the

415
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,120
ear as our antennas

416
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,590
let's say radiate in a

417
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,269
pretty narrow angle and away from our

418
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:56,460
brains so it hurts less than

419
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,000
cell phone

420
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,149
definitely so ok so this is

421
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:08,179
a photo taken this year in November

422
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:12,120
then last year where we  we

423
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,429
all met all the various islands in

424
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,130
rome

425
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:20,440
to talk a little about the prospects

426
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,560
let's say about nilox in italy and to

427
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,720
exchange experiences a bit like this

428
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,210
situation here the map with all the nodes

429
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,490
and the inter but for new york

430
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,180
who is interested in the project  it is an

431
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,220
excellent starting point because one

432
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:42,620
puts the placeholder sees the

433
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,810
neighboring contact placeholders through the map serves

434
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,090
says that nice if you are interested too let's

435
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,390
connect then  the

436
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,790
typical question of these days that we have been

437
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,210
sitting there has but but how do I

438
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,850
connect you come

439
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,440
we did not have we come to our

440
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,230
neighbor if you like the idea of wars

441
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,430
foams united united make the community it has

442
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,460
begun to build the network

443
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,760
the technical part  and secondary

444
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,440
the important thing is the people because

445
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,960
we have experiences that when the

446
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,010
base of the people for the communication

447
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,290
of the people is missing the desire to make

448
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,490
people

449
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,860
the network collapses miserably and there is

450
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,990
no toll-free number to call and say

451
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,040
linux does not work

452
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:35,060
I think  that it is venice when you arrive in

453
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,670
venice

454
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,100
ok i think that's all if there are

455
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:46,510
questions 17 24 and

456
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,370
how easy it is for a normal user

457
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,000
let's

458
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:04,580
say then at the base of the pdc the

459
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,490
whole project is very documented so

460
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,430
on wikis you on the site all the

461
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,730
information  so there are firmware

462
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,040
how to install if you go to the blog are

463
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,450
also the photos of we earn to install

464
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,960
the nodes then the advice of the

465
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,270
same advice is valid  star maniano dell'open

466
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,970
source that is the help of your neighbor

467
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,070


468
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,860
we from rome we go we have helped

469
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,990
those of florence those of florence

470
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,740
have helped others in short we help

471
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,330
each other you help you exchange experiences

472
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,450
I would say meetings like these are there  a

473
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,130
transfer of know-how

474
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,580
we here in this one in the east

475
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,560
there are many networking gurus we

476
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,910
have met we are

477
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,460
the networking scoundrels but we like to do it

478
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,250
so anyone can try their hand at

479
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,400
learning the question in the sense of whether in a

480
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,210
village for example yes  wants to create

481
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,750
an island yes it's ok there are a couple of

482
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,790
geeks who can manage

483
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,240
it

484
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,940
how simple it is then if we want to

485
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,240
put it in any case even this

486
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,560
thing means

487
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,570
the problem is that it is the same if

488
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,970
those two people remain and the others do

489
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,860
users do not scale dies here 11

490
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,050
moves for work one leaves the

491
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,540
village as happens most of

492
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:29,810
us

493
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,110
the network dies if every house for example

494
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,630
a antenna maybe a  shorter range

495
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,590
even non-directive

496
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,279
at 360 degrees and here or using a

497
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,830
router then each house and if the

498
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:48,029
mind is cheap for each person it

499
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:50,440
enacts laws are those two three people

500
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,190
who succeed it is not the principle of the cell

501
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,679
you are making a provider has buzzed  that is

502
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,510
the common wireless provides for the

503
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,539
involvement of the community in the

504
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:07,809
management of the network absolutely because

505
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:13,090
there is if one disconnects if you put it to the

506
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,649
lady who maybe does not know what the hell

507
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:19,299
we are talking about, that is if she is not in the

508
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:21,760
least involved and unplugs you

509
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,610
and maybe that  it is a knot of

510
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,059
passage to the truncated the s in two so it

511
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:29,830
is only for geeks

512
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,230
no because I can tell you from experience

513
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,750
that there are people who are not geeks but a

514
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,800
minimum a minimum a including the

515
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,130
let's say the concept is capable of doing a

516
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,660
minimum  troubleshooting

517
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,060
maybe it gets to a point where it says I

518
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,070
don't know technically capable ok at that point

519
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,260
there is someone who writes a mailing

520
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,140
list guys to this problem we will

521
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,840
help you that  but there must be a

522
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,420
personal hicker on the thing that is it is not

523
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,510
that otherwise it does not it is not for linux

524
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,590
it is not for everyone that is at that point because

525
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,360
if you want a storage solution if you want

526
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,140
a game server solution

527
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,730
whatever else you can find  it

528
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,620
costs less if we put it on the point of

529
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,930
seconds it costs less to do it on the internet

530
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,910
you make a connection you make a

531
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,740
connection if it breaks calls the

532
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,920
toll-free number that is the point of view that is

533
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,950
after the point of view of

534
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:34,280
the use of the thing is  different it is as if it

535
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,890
were so let's see it as a social network only

536
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,600
it is a social network and at level 7

537
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,350
application see facebook no this here

538
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:46,600
is at level 3 at level 2 at level 1

539
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,180
I know if I have made the idea

540
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:58,340
ok there are other experiences like wi  fi

541
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,590
that they mentioned before the network in

542
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,840
catalonia that 24,000 ways where

543
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,640
many people on the network are seen as

544
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,770
a very distributed ISP and there

545
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,100
are those who are in the ways the nodes for a fee

546
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,160
that solves the problems there are users

547
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,560
who fans  no users there is also in this

548
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,490
regard the network municipalities have a

549
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,560
minimum common denominator which is very

550
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,590
restricted and that is to live together

551
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,390
according to the rules of neutrality

552
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:37,200
with respect to the network then there is a way there

553
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,090
are different ways to live it here is  rome

554
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,450
for example the culture that everyone

555
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,280
must feel at least

556
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,860
involved in the management of

557
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,740
their own way that there is no nuance

558
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,810
as you can imagine rules between those who are

559
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,660
able to stop at the ping and say which

560
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,010
is my car does not come out  out of my

561
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,100
way and who maybe makes you collect

562
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,260
they send it back to me explains the tests of

563
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,060
not at all and in any case on two people who

564
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,830
then need someone

565
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,450
else's help we have to escalate the

566
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,670
problem that there is the approach  as he says and

567
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,850
very localized and very localized it

568
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,480
is up to the intelligence of those who decide to

569
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,000
do this thing and then let's say how

570
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,580
everything that must leave must have as

571
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,960
when making bread you need a bit

572
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,910
of yeast to make it  grow

573
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:31,530
so if there is no core that makes

574
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,360
this thing rise it is difficult for it to

575
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,850
take on its own so if you want to do they had

576
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,380
started to make a network start to

577
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,880
make a network two three friends

578
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,910
start broadcasting the ssd starts to

579
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,240
show you and the  network grows and the network

580
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,910
enters people enters also

581
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,260
people who want to do maybe

582
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,270
they don't know how to do anything about you network but

583
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,370
for example, what do I know they are very good

584
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,409
at communication they are very good at

585
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,890
designing interfaces you are good

586
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,520
at writing what they do too  part of the

587
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,310
various tusk that can be useful for

588
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,430
notes are decapitating me so

589
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,630
something on the fly insert some mechanism

590
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,390
let's say of direct convenience like a

591
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,890
bit like with logic for example that

592
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,980
was used for example fonera so in

593
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,090
fact you

594
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,730
by virtue of the fact  that shares some

595
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,240
of the bandwidth that you have on your wifi then you get

596
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,910
the free check

597
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,290
point as long as you attack the ces point

598
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,910
of that other in  that moment yours

599
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,430
is on ok but it supposes in one in one in

600
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,020
a community in which there is

601
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,110
no exit from the lan from the

602
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:48,790
man is the problem was less case the

603
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,980
push is much more motivating and knows

604
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,950
how to say then you can use  the internal services

605
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,700


606
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,310
however there are a lot of service

607
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,290
oh well anyway all these discussions

608
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,960
and we refer them to the banquet to we are

609
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,490
there to chat when you want to

610
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,830
come and disturb us there are we there

611
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,949
