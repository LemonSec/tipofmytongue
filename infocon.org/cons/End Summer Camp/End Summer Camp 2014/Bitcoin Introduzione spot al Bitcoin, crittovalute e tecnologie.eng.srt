1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,449
ok then in the

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,680
meantime I apologize but the talk was not

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,740
prepared in the sense that todt it

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,840
would have been there now and on bitcoin however

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,949
the person who had prepared it for

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,050
some reason is not there and then he is

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,710
improvising me trying to replace

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:27,800
and improvise the  presentation then

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,300
how many of you know what it is

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,870
they have already heard they know

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,969
ok so 30 percent have

12
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,760
heard of it then bitcoin is a

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:47,670
digital currency that was born in 2009 is

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,680
still in the bootstrap phase feel

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,010
computer more or less then the phase

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,140
bootstrap will be completed if I

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,730
'm not mistaken I go by heart around

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,370
2020 about the post rock phase consists

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,710
in creating these bitcoins that as they

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,670
are created we start from this there is a

21
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,250
public ledger public register that

22
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,200
contains all the transactions and is

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,030
public that are made with

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,670
bitcoins every few minutes

25
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,140
all these transactions are put

26
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,640
together in a block and

27
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,970
there is an algorithm that rewards who we say

28
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,710
we are  I'm simplifying and even

29
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,510
improvising so I could say

30
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,220
[ __ ] rewards those who solve this

31
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,110
block and verify the tennis player in reality

32
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,420
then it is solved is verified by many

33
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,450
but the moment in which this block

34
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,790
is verified a

35
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,090
certain amount of bitcoin is assigned to someone who

36
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:08,800
has it  verified at the moment there are about

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,890
13 million 12 million bitcoins in

38
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,030
full operation there will be 21 million so

39
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,040


40
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,370
the quantity of bitcoins

41
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,260
that will be in circulation in full operation

42
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,730
after the printing phase is already predetermined within the algorithm

43
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:36,050
ok creating a transaction means

44
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,610
have an address an address that

45
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,670
is called a wallet which is nothing more

46
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,150
than your public key but which

47
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,070
works with public key

48
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,330


49
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,190
private key when you create wallet

50
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,720
is actually created a private key

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,950
which is a random number from the

52
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,530
private key is possible  generate the

53
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,660
public key and consequently also the

54
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,640
wallet when you have this you

55
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,190
want to create  ato obviously there is

56
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,840
no transaction within the

57
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,390
public ledger that contains all the

58
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,160
transactions and therefore your that

59
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,510
said zero when for

60
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,210
example or mine it is said in jargon you mine

61
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,190
bitcoins or you have this system that

62
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,940
solves these  algorithms and validate the

63
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,800
transactions then you can decide on the

64
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,750
prize that you are given to put it in

65
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,930
your wants or you can

66
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,300
simply buy them from someone who matches them

67
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,880
t obviously when the

68
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,560
bus trap phase is over you can only buy

69
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,910
in reality there will always be the  fee

70
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,870
there is a small transaction fee which in

71
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,350
any case will go as a reward to those who

72
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,940
verify the transactions so in

73
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,710
essence your wants at

74
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,720
the beginning when you create it will have a total of zero

75
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,060
bitcoins at the time you buy a

76
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,519
bitcoin for example there will be  a

77
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,950
transaction from a hicks wallet wants

78
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,730
your wallet y a bitcoin that will be

79
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,160
validated by date by the miners

80
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,600
because the signature of the transaction  ne that

81
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,120
is done by wallet hicks is

82
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,190
compatible with its private key and

83
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,440
therefore the inside of all the

84
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,180
transactions of the public reads there will be a

85
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,730
transaction from xy of a bitcoin it is

86
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,800
therefore your bitcoin rom wallet inside

87
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,230
therefore basically what  you

88
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,960
with your wallet have nothing

89
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,110
but your private key multiply

90
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,440
private which is a number that is a

91
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,560
random

92
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:10,300
number and which contains the result of

93
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,029
all transactions made in the public ledger

94
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:14,889
now I am more kata a lot I

95
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,270
know there will be millions of questions

96
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,719
I hope and pray

97
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:26,129
someone has some questions help me to

98
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,319
no one everything is very clear they say evening

99
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,139
they say bitcoins remain anonymous

100
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,330
but if all transactions are

101
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,490
registered as sensitive ok obviously

102
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,499
then in reality it is all public it is

103
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:46,800
not it

104
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,570
is not anonymous the only one  anonymous thing that

105
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,610
exists is the link the connection

106
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,910
between the bullet the owner

107
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,890
ok in the sense that it is a number

108
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,950
basically ok but reconstructing  a

109
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,200
bit of all the transactions one can

110
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,610
understand who can understand the history of

111
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,080
how the wallet has been moved but you

112
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,380
can still see that it is popular through

113
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,270
or something

114
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,220
certain the bank transfer the boom in which the

115
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,810
transfer in this case does not exist

116
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,840
because there is  the list with the bitcoins of the

117
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,540
euros to someone who is him and is able to

118
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,440
know that which toilet after which the

119
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,090
link is lost, however for example if I have

120
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,480
a wallet of 10,000 bitcoins then I am

121
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,510
a lot of pennies and I'm going to get

122
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,590
some sweets

123
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,330
ok I spend 50 cents

124
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,960
I have left 9 10 milan lot of

125
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,250
bitcoins

126
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,080
the store manager knows that I

127
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,120
paid with a goal that had

128
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,689
10,000 bitcoins inside so here is

129
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:05,569
the anonymity that is lost and they

130
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:08,000
put some mechanism as a guarantee  of the

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,729
fact that I know these bitcoins someone

132
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:12,530
from today and tomorrow will tell me they are worth

133
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:12,830
nothing,

134
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,039
i.e. for example in the case of money

135
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:18,849
there is the state that it is theoretically there is

136
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:22,340
none there is no

137
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,039
technical mechanism that gives value to  bitcoins the

138
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,259
bitcoin value is given by the transactions

139
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:32,629
since it is based on the trust of the users

140
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:37,430
who exchange if there are

141
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,680
other web sites that essentially

142
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,729
act

143
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,250
as trading points where I can

144
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,199
make my offer to buy or

145
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,659
sell them and so on  when the

146
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:57,659
offers cross when the demand and offer

147
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:00,210
cross the price of bitcoin is established

148
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,460
at the moment around 500

149
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,539
dollars for

150
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,660
free bitcoin everyone here

151
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,690


152
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,590
today is self then yes this is

153
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,010
part of the concept of wanted which is

154
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,890
part of the concert of the dl  mining i.e.

155
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,290
bitcoin when fully operational will be 21 million

156
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,010
ok it will tend to infinity to 21 million

157
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,289
obviously but more or less we will

158
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,330
reach them towards 2000 they

159
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:44,420
don't make me 2021 I don't remember the

160
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,940
fact is that there is a component

161
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,480
called difficulty that makes  more and more

162
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,620
complicated there is always a need for more

163
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,090
power to be able to calculate i to

164
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,460
solve this this succeeds that

165
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,800
make up the blocks that are then part

166
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,680
of the public  ledger and therefore it becomes

167
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,470
more and more complicated it always

168
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,690
takes bigger cars we started that

169
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,840
the cpi was enough to finish passed the

170
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,450
dc more than one computer to undermine and gave

171
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,060
results at the beginning obviously

172
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,589
bitcoin came out at will

173
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,440
then slowly if you had to use  the gpu

174
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,779
the graphics card that with the elite curve

175
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:37,300
was fine then it was not enough anymore

176
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,880
and therefore the asiks were born so

177
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,980
we first clusters of

178
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,040
graphics cards then the agips were born that

179
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,500
have destroyed the thing a little so the

180
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,220
asiks are explicitly designed micro chips

181
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,010
pressure the problem

182
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,899
of the bitcoin own and therefore they do

183
00:09:58,899 --> 00:09:59,830
only that

184
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,410
there are machines that make a

185
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,310
rushdie tea of data when a gpu was 80

186
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:12,399
mag comes out where there are avalanche of big

187
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,470
cars that among other things this year

188
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,520
also a lot then and then now  I'm not

189
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,430
right now, like now, we have to take a good look at

190
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,390
it I don't express myself in

191
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,800
regards to mining but a ok

192
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,420
here this is a part of the

193
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,459
tames  nde to which I struggle in the

194
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:34,779
sense that they are probably

195
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,520
realizing they will have heard of

196
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,370
existence I do not know how many know

197
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,320
of existence it does not, that is the

198
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,600
legal yellow with the state that says ok legal and

199
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,380
illegal because at most any

200
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,720
type of good in  Italy that can be

201
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,240
exchanged for any good that is, that

202
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,040
you can make an actual transaction

203
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,500
if the calculated in Italy as

204
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,570
illegal money they read money and substance is

205
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,910
as if it prints silos at home on a

206
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,000
fake unless it is something me and

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,890
the  the only thing I can give are

208
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,560
vouchers for the exchange of the goods that I myself

209
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,250
produce or as in this case that is there

210
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,089
after then

211
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:26,930
I cannot tell you this I know that there are for

212
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,370
example there is the post of now I

213
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:35,319
advertise the  rocket that the rocket exchange

214
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:40,670
essentially for the

215
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,749
shopkeeper

216
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:44,689
he makes the invoice and neuro and receives euros

217
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:46,879
however the customer pays in bitcoins because he

218
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,309
passes through the exchange then the customer pays

219
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:53,600
the bitcoins the exchange co  nverte in euros

220
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,519
for the shopkeeper they return euros so

221
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,920
for the shopkeeper it does not change immediately after

222
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:03,319
there is the ex sense that he makes the change of

223
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:05,920
wanted yes yes

224
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,360
yes here this is not said

225
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,060
extremely important that is a bitcoin

226
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,430
is worth 500 euros but it is divided  for 10

227
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,750
at least 12 then you can go then

228
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,230
spend up to 0 lives at 0 000 000 a

229
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:33,819
bikini is terrible

230
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,490
then the wallet is actually just

231
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,009
a random number among other things the

232
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:44,240
random number between I think 0 and 115 x

233
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:52,519
10 to 75  so you are like 8 atoms

234
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:59,930
of the universe for no

235
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,790
then when there is no transaction in the

236
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,829
public lecture it means that you want to

237
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:06,550
empty everything there

238
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,480
is because there is a transaction in the public

239
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,870
ledger

240
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,610
no no no the bitcoin itself as  concept

241
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,430
in reality does not exist is this the in

242
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,319
reality what exists the

243
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:23,649
public register of all transactions

244
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:28,759
point is unique is unique and is distributed is

245
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:31,310
distributed peer to peer therefore in

246
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,800
essence it is synchronized in the peer

247
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:43,910
to peer network but you know yes between the  various

248
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,800
attacks that among other things is still

249
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,379
possible there is the hillman attack in pool

250
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:51,339
of 50 per cent

251
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:56,180
sygic comes out there it has arrived in fact they are

252
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,739
discussing how to solve

253
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,060
I can do it

254
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,220
as if it were

255
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,130
tofollow

256
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,960
yes now in a sense it would be like

257
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,750
hammering  because to reach 51

258
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,490
per cent of computing power they

259
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,930
spent a lot of money and so they would

260
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,790
disintegrate so I don't know how much

261
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,910
it suits them clear me but it

262
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,000
is technically possible and they are

263
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,680
trying to solve the problem

264
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:44,580
within the but in reality they do not

265
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,200
control it  rightly because they don't

266
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,090
control it, that is, not in the sense they don't

267
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,250
own it, they control it because the

268
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,350
mining pool is actually made up of those

269
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,100
users' money who are

270
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,420
yes yes

271
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,229
eto'o and it's all public

272
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:15,309
yes exact you know that but if I

273
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:29,300
had the same face

274
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,180
then understood a fair because

275
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:41,550
there are these

276
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,950
that are alternative krypton that

277
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,790
guarantee anonymity

278
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,200
then all more or less all debt derivatives

279
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,090
because then now we are talking about

280
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,670
bi  tcoin but in reality the

281
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,940
light coin was born many others who have

282
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:04,550
combined it to a lost goal they are

283
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,270
all the same as bitcoins are all there

284
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,860
are alternative things among the

285
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,450
alternative things there is for example one that is

286
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:19,520
being born now is that of  substance

287
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,920
a sort of dropbox scale its currency

288
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,780
where you can buy and

289
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,100
sell all hard disk sports and I don't know

290
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,410


291
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,540
that I don't think there was no need to make it

292
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:38,379
new currency but exact among other things

293
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:39,879
if I remember correctly I would not like to say  a

294
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:43,560
[ __ ] now I am registered but

295
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,029
they have decided those that it is a

296
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:48,310
fact the service of this service

297
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,720
here if I remember correctly they decided the

298
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,279
first the first 80 percent we

299
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,509
put it we keep it us the rest

300
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:53,860
of the 20 it

301
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,939
was so it has not  headquarters

302
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,750
yes yes yes no for charity in fact, among

303
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,400
other things, bitcoin obviously being

304
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,349
exchanged so it is the market value

305
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,839
given by the exchange in 2009 it was worth nothing

306
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,510
there is the famous case of a person who

307
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,020
bought a pizza not  I remember with a

308
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,709
thousand bitcoins and the times when 10,000

309
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:26,770
bitcoins and in more or less times and it does not

310
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,690
remind me of the American racer knows that later

311
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,400
when it came to a dollar this

312
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,990
here said we paid 10,000 dollars to the pizza

313
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,810
there is now worth 500

314
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,980
dollars l  'one I do well you

315
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,460
would buy see you see but it is the

316
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,809
risk there is one thing not

317
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:03,720
but you have found something exclusive to

318
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,340
Italy because as far as I know

319
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,200
in England there are a lot of

320
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,940
chains that already accept small in the

321
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,160
United States there are in  germany and in

322
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,299
holland in holland is going

323
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:17,490
yes now it seems that soon

324
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:22,090
ebay too I was born over books

325
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,539
with paypal through their other

326
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,820
company the one that does credit card

327
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,370
processing they start the sector shortly

328
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:35,890
bitcoin then the free software

329
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,620
foundation some bitcoin wiki pd  accepts

330
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:46,450
week coin as I do not know but all

331
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,169
public data are

332
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,779
and was very fast
