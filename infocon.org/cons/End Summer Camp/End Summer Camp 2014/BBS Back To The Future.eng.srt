1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,450
then it was democratically decided

2
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,869
that being the one who understood the least

3
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,300
of the subject of the talk started

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,080
the introduction and as Marco rightly said

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,269


6
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:28,470
let's start for a moment from what

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,780
the bbs were on a personal level for us it

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,290
is okay as usual to be

9
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,420
the old  wise

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,219
I remember when I spent half a million to

11
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,670
buy the acoustic cover I

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,620
use war games and I connected with the bbs

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,620
that is not the beautiful vbs fidonet

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,440
own mandate of the

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,660
bbs browse and monet users experts I managed

16
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,520
a bbs in florence that had a single

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,680
switched line then  we connected

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,360
one at a time it was a 2 euro plus apple

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,130
that had been created to mount not

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,340
two but four 160k disks and

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,200
the source of immense satisfaction to

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,490
meet these

23
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,689
high-level IT facilities

24
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:26,960
even if you had to spend the nights

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,799
on the phone  urban tariff

26
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,270
justify bills etc.

27
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,700
etc.

28
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,490
the dream of the time the dream of the time

29
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,770
to be able to connect  and the university

30
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,570
of essex where there was the first

31
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,180
multi-

32
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,790
user world that everyone was talking about and no one had

33
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,260
ever managed to connect why and it is

34
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,240
limited to 50 users who knew it

35
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,780
all over the world and that

36
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,470
at most it was handed down

37
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,790
traditionally I remember one  once

38
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,340
I managed to connect at the time

39
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,950
of boot he

40
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,690
receives the message the world has not

41
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,520
yet been created because on that bass

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,840
we launched the program then

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,850
obviously the line dropped

44
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,100
because the usual x25s had

45
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,590
the reliability they had and therefore

46
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,770
good peace of the  'computer science bbs to

47
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,239
summarize quickly for me it remained

48
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,420
a myth little practiced due to probably

49
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,190
total technical inability

50
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,000
then my experience and how bbs

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,470
started in 1994 with a modem 2004 that

52
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,450
bad weather was absolutely not the top

53
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,150
of the range because it seems to me that there

54
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,660
were already modems for sure  14 4 maybe

55
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,430
even something faster but it was

56
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,930
what I could afford as a

57
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,390
kid I started connecting

58
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,040
practically exclusive  mind the

59
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,440
main bbs from my city there

60
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,610
were 23 but only one noteworthy that

61
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,580
was moderately important not only in

62
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,430
fidonet but also in some other alternative networks

63
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,640


64
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,030
what was fidone in the meantime

65
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,209
but out a few words that maybe who is

66
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,630
not there  era will not know if shouts

67
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,250
interrupts issues so I explain it lido net

68
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,820
and still because there is still a network

69
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,170
of bbs

70
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,150
that use standard protocols

71
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,140
more or less based on cp to

72
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,270
exchange mail which can be both

73
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,480
personal mail and mail of the

74
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,810
message areas that you  call vico mail

75
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,120
at the time

76
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,380
I was a sewer node a user node

77
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,140
called point because the

78
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,260
fidonet addresses were something like

79
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,350
name.surname

80
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,110
and then the node number in my case

81
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,060
was 22 points 3 32 bar 20

82
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,390
6.10 what all this means

83
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,350
2

84
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,440
was the number of the zone europe there was

85
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,280
one united states and

86
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,030
oceania 5 africa 4 I don't

87
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,300
remember south america if you remember it oh well

88
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,979
206

89
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,740
332 was the Ligurian network and 206 was

90
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,450
the n  umber of the node here I connected I

91
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,560
was point number 10

92
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,280
the sidone environment let's

93
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,600
go into detail later I

94
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
continued like this for a few years

95
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,919
in the meantime after two years I started

96
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,410
to connect to the internet via

97
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,640
ucp only posts and newsgroups and then I am

98
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,510
other things arrive like the dsl first the

99
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,840
telephone flats for which slowly the

100
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,040
world has moved on to the internet what

101
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,260
remains nowadays of fidonet in

102
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,040
italy practically nothing

103
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,700
there is my node that a few months ago I

104
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,580
put up for a

105
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,120
we produce retro computing experiment

106
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,750
that is,

107
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,730
and

108
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,710
then

109
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,280
let's start from before at a certain point

110
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,710
I had fun setting up my

111
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,660
node number reachable only via the

112
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,380
internet

113
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,110
at a certain point even the most reluctant

114
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,030
had realized that this thing of

115
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,160
making phone calls

116
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,470
does not  it would last forever for which

117
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,540
protocols were studied for

118
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,540
exchanging fidonet mail via the

119
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,580
internet also because the phone calls

120
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,280
still continued to have a cost.

121
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,260
The structure of the network was

122
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,470
completely hierarchical so that each

123
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,000
node called the regional node with which it

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,730
exchanges mail and how which in

125
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,040
turn called a national node which in

126
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,710
turn called a European node

127
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,000
and all this with telephone

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,370
calls largely paid by the stops

129
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,560
for  as far as I know there was not much

130
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,260
much between king active at the time in

131
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,080
fidonet although someone had

132
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,000
ever told me if you have

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,870
different experiences let's talk about it

134
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,720
for which there were discrete costs

135
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,110
from yes software to exchange mail

136
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,380
and then

137
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,020
precisely it was  invented this

138
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,090
also different system to exchange mail

139
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,070
via the internet

140
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,930
at one point I had set up my

141
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,120
node which was also a gay stone towards

142
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,410
some newsgroups dedicated to this but

143
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,130
for various internal reasons and fidonet that is

144
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,890
mainly there were hard core this

145
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,500
is hot  they said is but if the mail

146
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,330
is also available through the internet

147
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,310
no one will ever connect to my

148
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,350
bbs again

149
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,080
and unfortunately they did not understand that the  what

150
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,050
was important was the community and it would have

151
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,910
been useful to keep it alive

152
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,550
regardless of the technology

153
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,680
perhaps guaranteeing it a

154
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,960
smooth transition to a different technology

155
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,530
that would have kept it together but the

156
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,009
attractions of the internet were still

157
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,669
too great for people to

158
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:55,129
continue to use the bbs a  once we have

159
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,919
reached affordable internet connections

160
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,699


161
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:02,029
we do not talk about adsl etc. so

162
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:04,849
over the years I have always obtained

163
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,550
this node

164
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,039
reachable via the internet which in the end

165
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,710
was practically the only

166
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,529
Italian node there is me who am the

167
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,539
national coordinator at this point

168
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,089
being  left alone and another

169
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:21,639
half active node

170
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,259
this summer

171
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:25,759
decided to do a retro

172
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,610
computing experiment if any of you experience

173
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,129
with things of dos like the manager share

174
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,969
point ex let's talk about it we will

175
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:36,610
introduce I installed

176
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,559
what was the program I used

177
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,659
as a point to manage routing

178
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,849
I asked you about the post called fasti co

179
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:46,310
I desco who developed it at the time of making

180
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,920
me a registration key for the

181
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,399
new node because the shareware and then I

182
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,160
installed gold and the program to

183
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,579
read the messages

184
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:02,480
and this living as long as yes and then there

185
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,279
are directories shared with the

186
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,079
incoming mail in  output that is

187
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,940
exchanged via the internet

188
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,800
at the moment

189
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,209
this is the state more or less all over the

190
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:14,209
world there are countries with more nodes with

191
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:16,970
fewer nodes maybe countries where

192
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,709
a radical cleaning has not been done as in

193
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,959
Italy because of no deaths but

194
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,980
apart from the  'former soviet union

195
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,720
where there are still many thousands of

196
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,050
nodes even if I don't know exactly what

197
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,510
they do because there is a

198
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,690
very strong language barrier for the rest in

199
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,459
the rest of the world fidonet is

200
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:39,829
practically non-existent there are

201
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,930
some people having fun  to keep on

202
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,319
your node or linux or emulated in

203
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:49,670
some way, however, all the

204
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,769
technology has gone ahead and the community has

205
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:54,760
not remained together

206
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,839
language barrier the boat

207
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,649
good morning  everyone

208
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:13,750
is a euro always a meeting of

209
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,970
anonymous alcoholics more than but in any case

210
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,910
I am not anonymous

211
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,500
then no the speech in the meantime I thank

212
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,019
there is an invited to do this

213
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:27,790
because in any case this year it is twenty

214
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,000
years since the 94 of the Italian crackdown that

215
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,620
then maybe someone  has read someone

216
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,339
there was someone knows

217
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,019
I also brought things I thought

218
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,029
it was because we had not clearly defined

219
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:41,560
what this brisk would be

220
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,600
anyway in the end I still have an

221
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,730
active bbs that is no longer connected

222
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,639
no network even if it keeps all of them  the

223
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,279
configurations I came out of fidonet

224
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,930
with the eagle earthquake because I

225
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,209
took the mail from gino legino lucrezi

226
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:58,690
who remained the bbs under the rubble

227
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,930
for which we hardly organize then

228
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,459
I tell you the technology because I around we

229
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:04,959
were organized to get the feeds

230
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,660
from  foreign with which I also explain

231
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,970
how the evolution of our bbs was the

232
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,680
bible if that of the metro graphics

233
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,560
I think you know it as bbs dot

234
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,360
lo gr  aphics punto org still active via

235
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,329
terne

236
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:20,829
tu my experience of that of those

237
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:22,510
years the thing is complex because I could

238
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,339
talk about it for hours but I don't think it is the case

239
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:26,649
since on the morning of the 10th

240
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,860
I started

241
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,170
this adventure in the theme that today

242
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,959
pays me the mortgage

243
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,660
in the  second half of the 80s with

244
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,510
300 baud modem connected to the

245
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,240
door of the commodore trying to

246
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,220
connect to the one who was whistling

247
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,839
on the other side no

248
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,720
acoustic couplers in Italy I have not seen any

249
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,620
personally I have only seen peaches and

250
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,350
self assembly cards of modems 300

251
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,360
baldi

252
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,470
yes yes I have to tell

253
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,390
you clearly you have to frame the thing

254
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,450
in the historical period there were computers

255
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,000
that we say personal computers

256
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,070
were affirming the ibm pc's are

257
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,510
affirming they came from a period in

258
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,120
which everyone had the spectrum the texas

259
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,450
instrument the comfortable l  'friend the como 64

260
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,250
that sells worlds that did not speak to each other

261
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,420
begins to come out the first

262
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,060
80 86 the first 28 if then because those

263
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,850
in my opinion have made the  difference

264
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,580
there was a whole scenario of bbs who

265
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,470
leaned on the world friend who

266
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,430
had their own way of living

267
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,279
and doing graphics the demo dinner of the time

268
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,510
etc.

269
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,300
there were a whole series of bbs

270
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,230
starting to set up knots

271
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,850
strand therefore with a very

272
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,370
strict policy on what was to pass or

273
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,040
not there were the diasporas as they are

274
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,779
today as there have always been there are those who

275
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,460
wanted it cooked who wanted it raw who

276
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,230
did not want the pgp pass for the one

277
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,310
after but who  he did not want

278
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,320
certain contents to pass through who

279
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,980
I wanted to talk about so on the pole

280
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,089
just jump years is that I am here

281
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,100
and on the technology he described

282
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,950
very well before marco then on the

283
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,930


284
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,670
ftn technology this type of mail exchange was still called

285
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,390
with these protocols

286
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,529
similar to the cp  for the exchange of

287
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,180
basically e-mails and

288
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,100
newsgroups even if they were called

289
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,380
aerial co also files if desired ago the

290
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,420
problem is that the random files

291
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,520
had certain  dimensions and therefore it

292
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,380
was necessary to bear the costs but

293
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,360
there were file distribution systems

294
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,790
for example my bbs was the

295
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,760
world coordinator of a huge network

296
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,520
of exchanging porn images

297
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,920
anyway

298
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,930
that is not my personal one and the one to which

299
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,439
I connected

300
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,380
therefore c  'they were a series of realities

301
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,060
around the world of bbs

302
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,620
meanwhile it was not called mail

303
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,870
matrix or net mail at most the most

304
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,080
advanced ones but 24 hours he says around

305
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,990
polling but reaches it was fine

306
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,260
against italy 24 retro also two

307
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,800
otherwise

308
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,430
anyway in short  this world I

309
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,710
was point me connective then to other

310
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,620
bbs in 94 all of a sudden they arrested everyone

311
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,450
for a

312
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,290
kidnapping they remained nobody in

313
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,850
reality if this was a series of bbs they

314
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,340
left two

315
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,660
because I train those who had a modem were not

316
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,940
always seen in a

317
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,770
good way yes there is  it was always this suspicion

318
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,170
in 93 the law on computer crime came into force

319
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,120
which was not there before

320
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,190
but the Italian scene was quite

321
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,510
varied there was  those who just

322
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,610
connected videos of the itit pack pierced

323
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,710
doing so entered the bucks etc.

324
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,930
there were a series of bbs who made

325
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,960
warez they

326
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,220
took software from abroad they

327
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,890
resold it for a fee then there were

328
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,170
all the world of bbs instead fidonet

329
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,910
who were at least had  a

330
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,830
clean facade then there were those who were consistent with

331
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,780
this and those who do not break for a

332
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,090
legal clarification there was no

333
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,310
law on the league line conflict until 93

334
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,340
exact means that there were some

335
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,590
bbs in a totally open way they were

336
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,110
exchanging illicitly copied programs

337
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,300
it was not a crime  a well-known

338
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,060
Italian provider the owner of a

339
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,820
well-known Italian provider at the time had

340
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,090
this huge bs for amiga they

341
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,890
had sued him for

342
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:51,280
unfair competition not being able to find other

343
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,640
legal footholds another stop I

344
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,950
knew

345
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,350
ran a bbs in the united states not

346
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,160
paying for the phone calls

347
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,019
in  feet I entered into force the law

348
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,300
on computer crime then thought oh well

349
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,378
I dedicate myself to fidone

350
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,720
si fa  ceva boxing there were calling cards

351
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,620
there was a whole world so boxing was

352
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,649


353
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:22,250
the use of some frequencies to

354
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,899
unhook the carrier on certain

355
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,970
telephone exchanges of a certain

356
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,889
period is in Italy for example the

357
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,300
Italian ones have never worked in

358
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,040
this technique, however, could be called

359
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,189
central is the last Montevideo era that

360
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:37,709
I remember working so you could

361
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:38,750
call

362
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,959
the switchboard of the direct with the

363
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,079
abroad send tones with the

364
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,550
captain grange the one who came to the

365
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,279
mocha was good at these things

366
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,829
anyway yes  they sent tones that changed

367
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:54,389
you took control of the central

368
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,629
you could redo phone calls

369
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:00,209
by dropping let's say the billing of

370
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:02,399
that phone call or use

371
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,619
American colin cards usually anti-

372
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,839
perfect therapy because this software was

373
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,760
often

374
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,980
imported from North

375
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,569
American South African North American BBS

376
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,799
a '  alternative and the use of

377
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,770
x25 networks that were widespread at

378
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,770
the prevalent dale level  entity that everyone had

379
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,830
no one used practically were devoted

380
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,260
to consumption like a telephone line if

381
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,360
you try your hand in possession of the

382
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,799
entrance code there was not even a password

383
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,720
through left-handed people typically

384
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,299
working

385
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:48,539
in the structures you could give them connected

386
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:51,710
to anything else perhaps with it on

387
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,710
x25

388
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,410
however to do wireless it was not good

389
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,780
that it was a thousand notes it was good to

390
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,640
make connections publicly to

391
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,120
try to connect with exotic bbs

392
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,880
to do the ass that it took this

393
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,419
outside the networks numerous are species

394
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:13,630
had this

395
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,929
no this is what  it was called

396
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:20,450
courier it seems to us a [ __ ] reason that

397
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,200
it was called curios

398
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,000
anyway going back to the bbs because that

399
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,620
is a period we were talking

400
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,390
about so many things we are also mixing them

401
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,090
the world of bbs had us for what

402
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,730
I remember a series b bs  who

403
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,010
did hacking and wireless activities

404
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,160
sometimes for a fee they wanted fees

405
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,900
because clearly they had costs

406
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,309
there  to be able to download this

407
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:46,370
software or simply the ratio, that is, the

408
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,650
more you applaud you pirated software the more

409
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,120
you can download it then there was the whole

410
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,740
world of trust networks of the fidonet network

411
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,210
which instead was

412
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,950
apparently very strict on these

413
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,140
policies who wrote the fidonet policies

414
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,940
currently in charge of the

415
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,000
vatican ced therefore in short,

416
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,330
the framing of

417
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,530
the network actually up to half had an

418
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,299
at least public official

419
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:10,520
very very very rigid setting which then led

420
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,470
to the creation in Italy of many other

421
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,990
technology networks that perhaps not everyone

422
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,280
knows the first cybernet then  decoder the

423
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,830
types of decoders of milan together with

424
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,830
other 10 m detach themselves from a fidonet area they

425
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,770
create their cybernet network with

426
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,080
the same addressing but instead of

427
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,890
yours starting with 6

428
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,870
the world of roles of role-playing games

429
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,630
is created its network  rpg network is a

430
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,140
group of crazy Neapolitans the p net

431
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,680
peacelink that still active as

432
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,970
an activist movement had made its own

433
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,070
network  the scouts are in fact their

434
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,200
network to the technology trend so there were

435
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,260
many Italian networks with this type of

436
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,110
technology that exchanged messages

437
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,660
I what I always say even in

438
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,620
metro graphics in the end nothing changes

439
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,200
30 years have passed 25 years but

440
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,230
in fact  with this stuff you do

441
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,730
private messaging

442
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,730
discussion groups chat and file exchange

443
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,310
so that it is facebook or that it was the b

444
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,400
bs of 25 30 years ago the things you do

445
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,760
are these then the contents change the

446
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,710
technologies change and the way of

447
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,300
approach  they change you can do it with your

448
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,130
smartphone but in the end we always do

449
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,630
what

450
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,880
we throw we talk about messages one by

451
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,820
one we talk about topics in

452
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,270
open public groups we exchange photos files and

453
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:34,860
programs

454
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,990
basically so the underlying

455
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,150
technology has changed but to come to

456
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,760
us  briefly in 94 from point

457
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,990
after the crash they gave as a

458
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,970
reaction created the association to give

459
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,700
a poly look and the motif of the meteor

460
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,860
free that here  they arrest us they seize

461
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,620
the computers we have to give a legal guise

462
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,350
to this activity because the law has

463
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,300
now changed and therefore we no longer understand

464
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,550
anything so we do the bbs

465
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,990
neuromancer my first bbs in 94 I opened it a

466
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,180
month after 11 May there  it was the crash

467
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,950
from an early June we

468
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,320
inaugurated neuromancer which I then

469
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,270
set up and remote access south or

470
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,570
if there is remote access fa stico goals the

471
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,070
programs he said only for boss

472
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,560
a line a bbs no multitasking

473
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,680
end of the computer used to make the

474
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,870
bbs

475
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,120
then the association m lo graphics is created

476
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,220
around this bbs we do a series

477
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,539
of things clearly in 97

478
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,720
we merge 2 bbs from Pescara in the meantime from

479
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,700
a pescara one of the pirate bbs who

480
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,249
exchanged software codes for

481
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:44,720
boxing and  it is taken is

482
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,379
seized

483
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:48,600
only the active vivanet bbs remain

484
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,759
those a little more so we open this bbs

485
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:54,149
after three years I change everything we do m

486
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:56,009
graphics bbs which is the pbs that is

487
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:59,309
currently still online and  there with a

488
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:00,690
vision a little different from what

489
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,700
he said we tell ourselves I didn't make

490
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,159
a small investment at the time which

491
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,749
didn't help because the

492
00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:09,090
internet had spread by now we bought

493
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,190
or cut which was a program made up of two

494
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,889
American steps  the santos brothers who

495
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:16,200
had us wild card for dos had

496
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,379
brought this stuff to windows nt so

497
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,019
a really multitasking system that

498
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:24,269
also worked together with other things

499
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:26,669
a frontend always made by them

500
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:28,820
which is called pixie like the

501
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,099
processor the standard mail and so

502
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:34,470
let's say first  attacked the modems and then

503
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,869
gradually removed the modems

504
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:38,970
abbs we reached the internet and

505
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,320
coluccino we had agreed to use it to

506
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,479
use a small program called

507
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:45,389
trans peak made by a madman who

508
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:48,210
simply takes mail packets

509
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,989
in fidonet format he attacks them  in

510
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:54,179
an e-mail luhmann on the other the other

511
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:57,299
takes these e-mails, processes and

512
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,820
puts them back into the normal glories hunchbacks

513
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,190
xmen and que  this stuff went on from

514
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,580
97 until the earthquake so I ended up

515
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,679
in the sky had until the earthquake the pbs

516
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,749
still online I honestly got

517
00:23:09,749 --> 00:23:12,179
back to it these days because they

518
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,489
asked to do the surgery if not I

519
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:16,289
connect like once every twenty years

520
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:19,529
about that I do anything else and therefore she

521
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:20,999
is there she lives her own life

522
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,789
sassoon serverino with

523
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:25,220
256 megs of ram

524
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,369
it still works

525
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,899
and I know it but we were powerful in the

526
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:32,639
years once 7 I put it graphics it was

527
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:35,669
in full expansion so it

528
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:38,690
could do all  these things

529
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,980
no that came after the ram

530
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,140
there have been some hardware upgrades

531
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,679
over the years so no no it was not and

532
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,390
therefore those who want to see it still there can

533
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,580
see very well with terminals like in the

534
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,230
facts I had prepared everything

535
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,299
because the graphics indeed  from all of

536
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:56,649
these of these standard tennet it is

537
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:59,770
disgraced so it does not make it not have

538
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,210
rim porn implemented well but it

539
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,000
still works even on

540
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,490
modern windows and you can see

541
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,990
discreetly I had lawn this

542
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,350
then oh well and therefore nothing there is a

543
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,820
museum an open-air museum we have

544
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,350
not left it I did not understand why you are

545
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,570
interested in this stuff from 20 25 years ago

546
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,799
the first question I asked him

547
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,210
when I put  maker what the [ __ ]

548
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,179
do we have to do a talk on bbs I personally am

549
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:24,010
an entrepreneur co2 grown up children I

550
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,350
play basketball I go with a bicycle

551
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,000
I don't understand the reason for this

552
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,279
interest in a dead stuff from

553
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,890
various pluses yes well

554
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,760
then

555
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,230
technologically this story is dead

556
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,779
I'm  completely contrary to any

557
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:46,090
form of attempted exhumation that is

558
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,250
not for historical memory that is I repeat they

559
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,230
are the bbs online so it is not that it

560
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,539
is a sort of museum but there are

561
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:55,059
several that is csec bbs still active

562
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:56,440
there are many those of the brothers

563
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,149
center o  via internet register they

564
00:24:58,149 --> 00:25:00,669
reach several bbs but I do not understand

565
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:03,070
the interest we are in 2014 there are

566
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,630
privacy problems problems of

567
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,980
any kind please

568
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,419
revive

569
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:18,400
me then instead  and to talk to you about

570
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,860
technology and then I will be brief

571
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,600
I can tell you that for me

572
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,090
personally it was one of the most

573
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,880
beautiful things that has happened to me in life

574
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,520
really because

575
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,809
I found myself in a

576
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:33,580
historical moment in which I was about 20 years old

577
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,480
and  with in hand you

578
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,659
felt at the time that this stuff

579
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:42,330
had a

580
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,279
monstrous mortal potential that

581
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,070
a revolution would happen I felt every day

582
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,720
I woke up at night I saw if we did

583
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,370
the ing while I was going to piss

584
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:55,000
I saw if the bbs because the users  he

585
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,520
needs my mail I warned

586
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,200
I was not clear what could happen

587
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,870
but then I also made other

588
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,960
making steps in the internet world etc.

589
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,120
etc.

590
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,690


591
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,460


592
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,940
there would have

593
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,520
been communication in many to me

594
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,169
caught up on things they

595
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:22,529
believed in i.e. I think I lived

596
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:25,750
the pioneering years  i of telematics

597
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,390
and that do not come back because

598
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,309
those were the years not thanks to us but

599
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:31,779
because we simply found ourselves

600
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:33,970
in the right place at the right time

601
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,580
while these things were happening we

602
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,529
perceived that I was being taken for a

603
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:40,570
ride because now in earners they are in

604
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,240
fashion  but at the time I can't assure you that

605
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,950
in the late 80's 95 final I can

606
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,950
guarantee you that in the late 80's nerds

607
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,950
and they weren't [ __ ] fashionable and that is

608
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,690
we were caught people

609
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,190
took my ass they said what the [ __ ] you do

610
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,630
all day in front  on the computer cheering on

611
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,700
[ __ ] of this type even

612
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,450
heavier then

613
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,880
here is the problem he knew the problem

614
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,220
was that who intuitively

615
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,649
tried to do a bit of evangelism and

616
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:15,309
then went to his cousin doctor from

617
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:19,149
his cousin student of nuclear physics and

618
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:21,520
tried to explain to him that there were

619
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,220
newsgroup that you could post a

620
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,910
question by

621
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,590
sending an email and within two hours

622
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,750
the world's leading expert gave a

623
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,940
detailed answer  what worked the

624
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,300
first is that it was unthinkable not responding

625
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,130
to an email in two hours because it was a

626
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,980
very serious insult

627
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,570
after ten years they almost all

628
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,180
told me actually I was taking you for a

629
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:50,430
fool is an extreme synthesis

630
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,440
they told me dear people with whom

631
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,960
what  However, they accepted this

632
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,630
scotoma of madness of mine because I told them

633
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,800
things that weren't together with the

634
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,740
interior then they accepted after the

635
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,440
flat modem connections

636
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,140
became common and therefore a few

637
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,390
hundred thousand people who

638
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,310
had heard me speak suddenly

639
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,400
entered  on the internet in Italy

640
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,450
I had these small satisfactions

641
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,420
given I was not so pleased by 10

642
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,250
years I thought he was so stupid but

643
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,130
in short, it is the synthesis and the synthesis of

644
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,420
the moment it is

645
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,420
at a social level up to a social level

646
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,300
what was happening thirty of us are  were

647
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,310
the children of the sixty-eighths ok so,

648
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,110
as always happens, we had

649
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,570
quite libertine parents who, however,

650
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,250
have  anza castrato then

651
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,340
chased and we arrived in a period

652
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,590
in which however you take into account now

653
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,540
you connect you have friends that I know

654
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,060
in america in australia we are close to

655
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,240
mars moon and so on but first

656
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,580
everything was the small ancient world linked

657
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,320
to the village to the city  I live in

658
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,360
avezzano in the province of L'Aquila

659
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,520
and obviously the friends were the ones

660
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,500
you met at the bar you saw and so on

661
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,050
the same thing if you had to ask

662
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,660
for some information have

663
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,940
some doubts about something or the

664
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,470
mimeographers insisted that they came to you once

665
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,990
a month but it has  a name etc. in the mail

666
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,140
or in any case you had to stick to the

667
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,710
zebedees because there was no way to

668
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,750
go and find a quick way to

669
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,300
exchange ideas so as soon as

670
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,720
the bbs arrived for us and an incredible [ __ ] world opened up

671
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,580
that is I can

672
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,880
talk  with one in america in an

673
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,320
unthinkable English and that's what

674
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,030
those answers me as well because obviously

675
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,060
we didn't have google translator

676
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,710
veram  ente condition or letter for the

677
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,630
three I then I had done French in

678
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,180
middle school so imagine writing in

679
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,640
English and then let's say the

680
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,490
social impact was enormous as he said

681
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,140
when I bought my first

682
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,240
computer it was the zx80 550

683
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,340
thousand lire and 550 thousand lire  that for

684
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,570
inside about half a million

685
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,250
what they were now is right then either

686
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:33,090
an employee a moped ok I get

687
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,110
home

688
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,910
this is a computer takes a

689
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,920
fake keyboard but here a k of ram

690
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,860
that is an exceptional graphics

691
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,620
64 by 44 pixels white and  black

692
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,690
obviously attacking the television and

693
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,030
there were bad things understood for which

694
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,610
even being able to finally reach a

695
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,679
level of hacking that is before I was

696
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,520
geek with

697
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,140
electronic savior in hand start

698
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,000
working on a computer weld

699
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,100
it weld it and program it too

700
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,010
machine language and obviously being able to

701
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,340
connect with a model that is really

702
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,230
scrauso to

703
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,000
connect with the whole world and

704
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,390
therefore have it within reach of  i hand understood for us

705
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,210
a really message that he sends away and

706
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,550
after two days he would return the answer

707
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:28,260
is [ __ ] he did immediately it was a

708
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,140
lightning understood now for you i am still

709
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,820
not answering 10 seconds that i send it to

710
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,160
him look at my girlfriend up here

711
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,140
whatsapp

712
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,910
understand what it is  the speech for which it

713
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,580
was really a disruptive thing

714
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,470
so imagine you that maybe you

715
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,090
have always been your garden in

716
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,590
your kindergarten in your really

717
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,059
little ancient world at some point

718
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:49,790
you can

719
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:52,860
obviously travel through the internet else

720
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,920
you now have my low cost flights

721
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,040
us  this case, that is, hello, but Italy,

722
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,630
that is, going abroad was really

723
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,960
a business but from the thread I understood

724
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,610
or really where to avoid

725
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,690
backpacking and struggling around so

726
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,220
this here is significantly

727
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,650
freedom the internettian sexual freedom is

728
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,750
not  more to go in

729
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,640
search of porn magazines

730
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,350
maybe left in the woods but finally to be

731
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,000
able to download the images  ini

732
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,330
directly from the internet

733
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,890
I do not have the syndrome of my time

734
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,080
but I realize that I am like my own I

735
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,400
remember my grandmother who went

736
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,900
hungry during the war that when there was

737
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,600
food but they loaded and we had

738
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,309
this type of  approach with food that

739
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:36,870
is different from those who have not been hungry I

740
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,110
have chosp the text everywhere that is me between

741
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,110
300 bars me if this the 4g I always have to

742
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,030
see how much more and more gang makes me more and more

743
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,340
band that is never enough for me in the cie  from

744
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,010
10 gb i'm happy i always do

745
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,710
ispi tess this is a disease that exists and

746
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,730
i don't live i don't say that once no

747
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,350
i don't i don't like to say in my time

748
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,900
because i live contemporary i am

749
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,490
an entrepreneur of a small company

750
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,140
that  IT security is also

751
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,930
fairly good but this

752
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,670
approach with the band for example that

753
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,520
I realize that

754
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,840
people who are a few years younger than

755
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,790
me do not have because for them the band is

756
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:18,470
discounted for less that is me if this is

757
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,300
in fact one of the 4g  things of which vol  evo

758
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,820
talk is that

759
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,340
you who have never used a modem in

760
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:33,650
2004 do not have 300 boo or worse,

761
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,390
however I have never used

762
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:40,830
a modem to connect via fidonet you

763
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,390
have no idea what the

764
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:46,170
pressure was to save resources

765
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,200
1 because they were

766
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,160
technologically limited  2 because the yes

767
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,160
tops paid their bills out of their pockets

768
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,870
to exchange mail for which there were

769
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,940
beautiful rules

770
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,920
beautiful habits now a bit lost like

771
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,890
the senseless quotation of emails and one thing

772
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,918
that I have learned fidone in fidonet and

773
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,899
that will be useful to me throughout  life and that it

774
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,850
would be nice if many more people

775
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,520
knew that you do not reply to an

776
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,639
email at the top because microsoft

777
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,899
decided it a few years ago

778
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:29,010
and then since the top paid

779
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,239
their bills out of their pocket

780
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,530
there was also a

781
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,960
very strong social control  on the contents because they said

782
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,770
I marry your mail follow my

783
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,860
rules and there were different networks with

784
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,129
slightly different rules fidonet in particular in

785
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:46,590
particular in Italy it was

786
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,230
particularly restrictive

787
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,350


788
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:55,230
In fact, on certain issues, other networks were born with

789
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,440
slightly different objectives, however in

790
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,350
general there was this habit of

791
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,910
staying on topic

792
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,950
in a certain area of discussion

793
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,320
avoiding talking about one's own business,

794
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,320
wandering etc. and this allowed to

795
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,079
maintain a very high quality that

796
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,900
now it has been lost practically everywhere,

797
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,800
however, they seem to be positive to

798
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,690
make people understand the impact that the quoti nng

799
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,829
for example had in my life

800
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:26,109
still says the signs on the back of the

801
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:28,690
moderators who took you back no more

802
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,640
than twenty days ago a month ago my

803
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,190
14 year old daughter  I said something at home and

804
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,770
she told me dad this ti quoto because

805
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,290
now ti quoto has entered the

806
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,970
common language they also use it a little inappropriately

807
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,430
no because we used it only now

808
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:45,460
entered the common language of the CEI

809
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,230
guys to say I'm d '  agree with you you

810
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,750
say this i quote this thing

811
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,609
put me my 14 year old daughter so

812
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:54,250
i mean this [ __ ] that we felt

813
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,440
powerful did those  work on the

814
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,480
revolution there has been mass diffusion

815
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,000
there has been seeds to be a bit

816
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,740
but in the end at meetings of this type

817
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,290
we are always the usual 100 150 I

818
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:10,380
assure you that we have been 150 for at least 25 years it

819
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,910
is so and so we are always 150

820
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,770
people change is but in the end the

821
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,960
number is always the same the base has

822
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,630
increased a lot of those who

823
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,710
now approach technology have

824
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,290
practically everyone today from the

825
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,630
elderly to the very young have internet

826
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,390
in their pocket but maybe those interested in

827
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,760
these things always an

828
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,270
extremely small circle of

829
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,800
sorry people I quickly reconnect with

830
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,390
what he said for a different reading

831
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,380


832
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,060
many of you were there last night they

833
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,750
enjoyed the talk of miami rebus they

834
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,380
saw matthew broderick

835
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,110
and with the girl around an accomplished and

836
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,990
fake that we had built

837
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:57,260
for the occasion  it

838
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,790
was a very funny thing

839
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,760
because he saw it as a final comedian

840
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,890
at that time having a few years

841
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,010
more I was already studying I worked together  I

842
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,220
was doing the moonlight programming

843
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,680
a hotel stand for example on an apple ii

844
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,340
with 48k and they sold it to hotels

845
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,130
and I had the acoustic copy I had

846
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,530
the computer

847
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,330
I could understand by ear what

848
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,400
the modem was doing when it makes those curious

849
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,450
noises and if  he would have taken a line by

850
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,310
listening to the notes to those who have dropped

851
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,610
speed can not fall

852
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:38,130
the important thing is like this but without

853
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,190
anyone having explained a musical ear

854
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,840
applied to technology

855
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,640
the problem was that he did not have a

856
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,800
blonde girl who insisted on

857
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,380
coming and seeing  my computer turned by

858
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,640
touching the various equipment

859
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,050
that is actually world games had a

860
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,060
profound impact on my need

861
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,090
for the world no I have not yet come

862
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,940
to understand everything, absolutely everything, however, the

863
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,700
acoustic hp cesano one thing that we have not

864
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,220
said because we are talking about details

865
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,800
and I think  that if I say this everyone will

866
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,650
know each other at that time it was not so much

867
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,720
the fact that we had had access to

868
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,420
one thing  that it would not change

869
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,250
the world it had changed it from us to me it

870
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,680
changed my life I found

871
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,320
myself dealing with virtual reality

872
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,730
suddenly you doing these things

873
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,120
here it is because the cinematic special effects

874
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,830
were there even once it

875
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,030
is

876
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,790
like that  it happened it happened that I

877
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,710
lived

878
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,470
isolated on my skin the first wave

879
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:45,040
of information overload once I

880
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,100
started a book a manual to put on

881
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,830
an armchair you read it from the first

882
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,930
page to the last then the region there

883
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,460
also because it deviates a friend maybe

884
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,110
unfold what you did not understand

885
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,410
or talk about in an email and this is an

886
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,750
event that marked a week a month

887
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,780
of your life but deeply I had

888
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,860
understood one more thing from algorithms more

889
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,540
from equal data structures and go-to

890
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,630
programs to the manual of the little program that

891
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,250
did  strange things

892
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,680
every access to information

893
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,440
changed your life you had to look for it how to

894
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,570
go to the library look at the

895
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,880
tags those of narrow

896
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,100
drawers for  r find something and spend the

897
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,580
morning with it and because you didn't find it

898
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,960
well this had been an information

899
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,630
had them before you could absorb

900
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,450
all the information that existed for you

901
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,150
in the world that you could find

902
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,560
because you were the

903
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,380
bottleneck not  he managed

904
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,810
from newsgroups onwards suddenly you

905
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,030
realize that you will not be able to read

906
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,070
everything you want because

907
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,830
hundreds of emails keep coming to you in the 12 15

908
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,170
hundred newsgroups myself and at

909
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,510
some point you have to throw them away

910
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,420
you will never be able to read them that is this type of

911
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,670
creating problems  at work

912
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,040
at the time I was already working that they see you

913
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,020
it was not so normal that one was

914
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,360
always stuck behind a computer

915
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,950
once you still wrote on the notepad

916
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,710
which having the computer on your

917
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,970
desk can create problems at work at

918
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,000
some point the super g  somehow

919
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,040
this is an experience that our

920
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,540
generation

921
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:30,610
let's say who at the time from 14 to 20 30

922
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,010
years had to overcome in some way  on

923
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,650
his own skin, perhaps not even knowing

924
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,980
how to tell exactly how it happened and

925
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,890
this what computer scientist who is a

926
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:45,010
shock and informative instead all the

927
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,740
others who have had

928
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,690
different technologies have not had to overcome it not

929
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,150
because of the technologies as

930
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,130
neuro rightly said but simply

931
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,260
because  from something that only

932
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,320
very few knew it had become something that

933
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,030
you could ask your desk mate

934
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,690
so the new generations let's call

935
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,230
things sorry they didn't have to experience

936
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,560
the shock of a flood of training

937
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,980
that is to spend

938
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,750
hours looking for hours looking for a book in the library

939
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,480
up to say I can not subscribe to

940
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,030
this penny I can not go and

941
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,500
read this thing here because I do not have

942
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,610
time all this for me meant

943
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,040
tearing my heart is thrown from

944
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,630
that other side because it is inconceivable

945
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,820
not lectern and all that are

946
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,990
curious shiver  puts in the hands

947
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:45,300
call of the forest is too strong if

948
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,640
I tell you right away that  I think I am for

949
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,610
the klondike but apart from that I

950
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,470
lived it all from the beginning to the end

951
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,690
I too had the acoustic tower couple and

952
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,030
I will say more that today it could also

953
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,920
be there and that I never went to

954
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,530
bologna otherwise in a warehouse  in

955
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,750
bologna there was one I wanted to take him to take

956
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,340
a handset of the one that is attached

957
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,200
from cell phones and try to make a

958
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,150
connection to 300 because 1200 in

959
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,850
my opinion would never have gone

960
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:14,100
from the other stage, however, a

961
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,260
call to see what you said that there  he

962
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,270
did it at 300 he does it could also

963
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,340
be a pity that I did not go to those

964
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,930
from bologna as a result and I do

965
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,280
n't even know if he still had it in the

966
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,950
warehouse because he had to see so

967
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,810
initially I too had so I have

968
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,460
86 and all that  who was

969
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,970
behind the modem 300 as ask why it

970
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,370
cost less than the external one so it's

971
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,170
all such a thing and after which

972
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,150


973
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,790
I practically used the classic people for the

974
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,350
call on the first

975
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,910
internet connection it was with  a manager who

976
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,360
praised for free that italy online and

977
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,680
ran a script at night i

978
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,960
heard his the big computer

979
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,490
sounded see [ __ ] connected with

980
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,610
mosaik i saw my first page that

981
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,319
was not google because it is not that see

982
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,989
not c  'it was and therefore practically it

983
00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:02,609
was my first connection with the great

984
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:04,380
satisfaction that you knew that you are

985
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,199
doing it for free that this is a great one

986
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:08,459
because precisely with the fate of the

987
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:10,559
absolute economy you did not know that you were doing it for free

988
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:12,209
then over time it happened that I too  I

989
00:43:12,209 --> 00:43:14,039
opened a part that I connected to the

990
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:15,539
nodes I signed connected or that has

991
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:17,759
a bologna stand which was a beautiful thread knot

992
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:19,709
and actually the first

993
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:21,959
thing that they understood that who the real

994
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:23,640
cool was not only the fact of drawing

995
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,489
the jpeg porn files etc.

996
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:28,619
but  the real cool is the fact of the newsgroups

997
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:31,199
that is the ones that are today forums and

998
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,209
newsgroups evening from which the rules are then derived

999
00:43:33,209 --> 00:43:34,890
because in fact the rest

1000
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,390
came out with the blog there is because you

1001
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,459
realized and  ffectamente to

1002
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:40,459
broaden your circle because then

1003
00:43:40,459 --> 00:43:43,349
you say that you are an expert that I

1004
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:45,779
know I deal with databases I

1005
00:43:45,779 --> 00:43:48,329
do not know you in my area that

1006
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:50,729
database expert four cats at my level on

1007
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:53,160
that type of specific area here

1008
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,660
are others I am  respect in networks others

1009
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,609
are web experts high everyone has their own

1010
00:43:56,609 --> 00:43:59,609
experiences meant that suddenly to

1011
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:03,890
widen the circle of 23 people

1012
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,569
more or less your level of competence

1013
00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:10,769
to a circle of 50 60 100 people of

1014
00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:12,269
which there are at least thirty as many  which

1015
00:44:12,269 --> 00:44:15,059
are a hundred times more than you and therefore being

1016
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:17,069
able to talk directly then with

1017
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:18,690
a mechanism whereby if you ask the

1018
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,130
stupid question there is the one who wants to show

1019
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,559
that he knows it and answers you the same if you go

1020
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,869
to super intricate question to greater

1021
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:28,170
satisfaction that  that will be answered by

1022
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,089
respondents and this mechanism is

1023
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:32,249
what then in the end was really the

1024
00:44:32,249 --> 00:44:34,019
difference because then in the end today the

1025
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:37,289
blogs, forums and facebook also dressed

1026
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:39,569
the cassata practically  and they are all

1027
00:44:39,569 --> 00:44:41,910
derivations of this logic here and there he

1028
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,589
had understood it first about

1029
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:45,959
what little but certain then another thing that

1030
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:47,579
had happened to me that practically some

1031
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:49,289
point covered even a small bbs

1032
00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:51,239
just a very specific theme because it

1033
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:53,099
had neither  works in a company that thanks

1034
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:54,749
to geomechanical geology I worked

1035
00:44:54,749 --> 00:44:57,719
with probes and then we did one thing

1036
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:00,059
to the theme no burned a program to

1037
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:02,980
run under dos and practically

1038
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,170
managed this little bbs then over time

1039
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,760
what to do when the internet started

1040
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,020
I said castro do the  provider and

1041
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,840
internet in ferrara and then you make the

1042
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,350
first internet provider in fact it

1043
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:16,180
moved me when I saw a sport for there it is

1044
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,030
supported that it was an amazing modem

1045
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,920
because the other was the one for rich

1046
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,210
that other was a little less rich

1047
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:25,170
but it worked like a god  it is practically

1048
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:27,190
then how did it give

1049
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,380
connectivity no you went from the

1050
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,840
sip then there was the sip tells him it's

1051
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,490
about I need sixteen

1052
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,619
telephone lines  he down 16 telephone lines

1053
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:38,109
had a battery of modems which of

1054
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:39,580
you were turning around because the problem was that

1055
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,290
the type of switching that there was you

1056
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:42,460
had the first way in which it worked

1057
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,080
from morning to night that could

1058
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,280
catch fire is the last one that did not

1059
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,280
he never worked so every now and then doing

1060
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,160
the rotation of the modems but the

1061
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,230
one starts and so on after the whole story

1062
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,240
went on and actually when

1063
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,890
I finally started sc flat lines

1064
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,930
everything changed

1065
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:01,060
but we had already understood that

1066
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,590
logic ii and this did

1067
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,359
difference because then in reality those

1068
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:06,100
who moved then many were

1069
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,290
precisely those dino of trust and therefore

1070
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:10,690
they already knew what they were expecting

1071
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,910
on the other side and then after everything

1072
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:15,880
else another thing went on the

1073
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,600
copier and

1074
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,800
had some LEDs  this picture of the

1075
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,960
beautiful LEDs and caught fire with a

1076
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,000
certain ease and then had another thing

1077
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,130
is

1078
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:32,440
then the copy leaves the place the

1079
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,030
acoustic tour couple was used because

1080
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,910
also  and not only for those who did not use the

1081
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:39,190
world instead of from but also because if they

1082
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,750
had to transfer files for example

1083
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:42,520
I had to not know how to download a data from a

1084
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,410
probe I had to send it what do you do you

1085
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,000
connect the wifi network but what the [ __ ] there

1086
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,609
is no wifi network what exists  the

1087
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:50,650
phone booth with the tokens then the

1088
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,660
more an idiot arrived with a box

1089
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,430
as well as with the computer etc. you

1090
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:55,750
take a copied view and made the

1091
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,630
call and when if tvb bob rock trac

1092
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:01,810
game or call 300 because

1093
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:03,970
hoping it would go maybe you did 23

1094
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:06,430
attempts and what  maybe you made the

1095
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:08,290
second attempt while you made the second

1096
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,010
attempt

1097
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,020
on the other side in the company phoned

1098
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,750
a lady on the other hand heard

1099
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,769
on the modem

1100
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:18,749
lady took no one you in the meantime

1101
00:47:18,749 --> 00:47:21,450
call find busy and then after

1102
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:22,859
a chain occur that for which afterwards

1103
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:25,529
in the end  in short there goes 56

1104
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:28,109
calls 10,000 tokens and then you see the

1105
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:29,059
guy is

1106
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:32,430
leaning on the handset click click

1107
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,019
grid techniques and there and there watching the  The return

1108
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:35,460
warning he makes it he

1109
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,829
makes it now he makes it

1110
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:38,989
today another world

1111
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,589
is another thing that

1112
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:45,509
is not written anywhere

1113
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:47,609
the computer industry of the time already

1114
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:49,710
existed that is we are talking about the

1115
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:53,549
bbs world that goes  go on with the blow that

1116
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:55,829
olivetti gave with the m24 which has

1117
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:58,650
become the best-selling pc in the world

1118
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,960
i was lucky enough to end up

1119
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,579
working in olivetti and to find myself at any

1120
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,980
moment to beg the gang

1121
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,009
somewhere to have  an e-

1122
00:48:08,009 --> 00:48:10,980
mail address because all idea or idea was one

1123
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,789
of the twelve hosts of nfs net so

1124
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:16,529
I found myself in one of the three places in

1125
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:18,720
Italy maybe you want the university where

1126
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,039
everyone had an e-mail

1127
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:21,660
address and everyone used the internet

1128
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:25,099
too  if it wasn't called that,

1129
00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:28,200
there was no coupling the

1130
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,309
computer industry and we call it telematics

1131
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:34,910
who had experienced much less experience with bbs

1132
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:37,890
like me suddenly

1133
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:39,989
found himself at an advantage because people who

1134
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:41,150
understood all

1135
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:45,599
the ttl circuits knew how  throwing a

1136
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,140
pc in front of the trivial use of the line

1137
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,930
needed you to explain it to him

1138
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,489
i ended up at any moment

1139
00:48:53,489 --> 00:48:55,230
as the system administrator of

1140
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:56,609
one of these places where there is

1141
00:48:56,609 --> 00:48:58,680
direct access and internet and so i

1142
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,720
said cabbage  and they even talk to me

1143
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,430
no just because love saw that we are

1144
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:07,559
making history we make history and the

1145
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:10,170
speech of the business of computer science

1146
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:11,759
of the bbs gave a big hand to

1147
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:13,319
these gentlemen who were then

1148
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:14,880
bought for example of the tricom la

1149
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,619
zeit sel that it was not  no one started to

1150
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:17,509
do

1151
00:49:17,509 --> 00:49:19,969
so part that one who puts his name

1152
00:49:19,969 --> 00:49:22,279
on his company for the names I am

1153
00:49:22,279 --> 00:49:24,979
sick the association m lo graphics from

1154
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:26,509
a book

1155
00:49:26,509 --> 00:49:28,130
the company quantum leap from a computer

1156
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,409
then these have named the

1157
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:32,899
company us robotics which is the  'company

1158
00:49:32,899 --> 00:49:35,829
that makes the robots in the asimo trilogy

1159
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:39,019
did de standardize in the sense that

1160
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:42,099
if the standard was undoubtedly 2004 it was

1161
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:46,069
24 bis with the protocol correction they

1162
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:47,229
did

1163
00:49:47,229 --> 00:49:52,549
what went 96 hth tsh th n  I do not know

1164
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:53,630
a protocol that they had

1165
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,119
invented for which

1166
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,219
discount after a

1167
00:49:57,219 --> 00:50:00,799
strong discount result if they bought the

1168
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:03,049
courier what they had to buy in

1169
00:50:03,049 --> 00:50:05,059
such a way that then users were

1170
00:50:05,059 --> 00:50:07,219
encouraged to buy the sport ster

1171
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:10,609
because it supported the 9600 because everyone

1172
00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:13,519
went to 24 with the  standard modem and but

1173
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:14,839
we are talking about stuff that cost

1174
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:16,839
millions

1175
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:18,849
over the years the end of the eighties

1176
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,150
annual cost 1

1177
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:24,059
million lire

1178
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:26,680
and therefore also there a whole business had been created

1179
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,140
clearly related to

1180
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,829
numbers and

1181
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:35,259
also a whole series of bs software that

1182
00:50:35,259 --> 00:50:37,989
also  if shower, however, good or bad we

1183
00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:39,670
paid in some way also to

1184
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:43,089
support the thing is to talk about money

1185
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:45,039
among other things even knowing the exchange rate

1186
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:47,380
the devaluation does not convey the idea and on

1187
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,140
my shot bio it says that at a certain

1188
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,690
point I had to  decide if birthdays

1189
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:55,960
the car or an apple with compensation from the

1190
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,640
computer and I chose the personal

1191
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,440
computer the price of the same 4

1192
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,190
million and a half of the

1193
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:05,170
poor I all  'era I was 16 years old

1194
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,719
no more or less I was at my house I

1195
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:10,630
bought my internal trust 14 4 which

1196
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:13,380
cost less than the one there

1197
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,450
I was a student I didn't have a penny

1198
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,950
the telephone

1199
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,859
line the telephone line was the one at home

1200
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:22,380
there  it was my mother who

1201
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,880
called relatives in the evening so I

1202
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,619
could not use the phone for the bbs no

1203
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,450
it

1204
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,190
is not clear that this thing goes so

1205
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,190
I had put on a bbs that was open

1206
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,829
from 10 in the evening to midnight and 13

1207
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,359
says midnight  and my mother knew that she could not

1208
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:41,430


1209
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:45,190
call but if you tell her at

1210
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:47,019
midnight the bbs was turned on i

1211
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:48,819
watched people

1212
00:51:48,819 --> 00:51:52,739
connect to us i could not connect to the bbm from 10 o'clock

1213
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:55,960
i connected at seven o'clock with my

1214
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,940
mother head on the phone I heard  the

1215
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,910
casino bellagio the line I cursed

1216
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:05,469
cheerfully so it also caused

1217
00:52:05,469 --> 00:52:09,539
some familiar shows this thing

1218
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:15,770
this thing here was

1219
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,690
the form in solutions my trusty

1220
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:19,040
admits I have seen it enough with binoculars

1221
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,200
having something that could be connected

1222
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,110
like this  coli otherwise I had a friend

1223
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,620
who always ran on fidonet was called

1224
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,730
deus and maybe he knows why he

1225
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,920
wrote everything in capital letters because he was

1226
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,960
14 and he felt the coolest on

1227
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,180
earth and was pardoned and while

1228
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,720
the operator

1229
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,210
who took him for this let's say

1230
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,670
in short  they don't always tell me more as an

1231
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,880
excuse illicit how you have to write

1232
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,010
things but

1233
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,630
on one thing, however, what I ask myself

1234
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,490
but if here you had all the bbs hands

1235
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:04,570
what the [ __ ] are we talking about when

1236
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:07,370
we are telling it they are expected to

1237
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,770
hang on us like  as usual months

1238
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:13,070
invitations about money

1239
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:15,850
about money no my first portable

1240
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,160
laptop and they weren't brought it was a

1241
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,450
portable one because it cost much less

1242
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,790
than the laptop you don't know

1243
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:24,620
what is untraceable then you have

1244
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:28,130
this as an air one of how I was a tbm

1245
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,530
that  did not

1246
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:31,670
then someone thought the case

1247
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,230
we make the portable version we make

1248
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,500
the video so

1249
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,440
then the video so we fit it

1250
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,320
alongside there was id  e slots for floppies if

1251
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,970
you had money you could also have a hard

1252
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,350
disk

1253
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,360
practically the keyboard closed

1254
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,090
in front

1255
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:52,340
and is doing from a height of about one meter

1256
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,430
by one meter in short, it is a

1257
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:56,740
consistent stuff with an equally

1258
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:02,229
heavy weight it is all a [ __ ] vision

1259
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:08,280
yes so it wants to  to say that from that money

1260
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,290
he took from me

1261
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:13,970
you buy used and attention

1262
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:18,090
later after then after having changed

1263
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,610
the notebooks came out and so on and so on

1264
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,910
and when the company bought

1265
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,930
the toshiba with the plasma screen

1266
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,580
and then there was the  other cool the

1267
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,710


1268
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:33,180
famous hercules card who has seen the card is who has

1269
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,010
used the card they read and you

1270
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,500
just had a great resolution how many

1271
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,340
the resolution of the hercules sori

1272
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,200
here yes facts that then go beyond

1273
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,550
the 6 40 x 480 and practically  black and

1274
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,230
white is however now let's not exaggerate then

1275
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:51,210
it wasn't even a black and white

1276
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:53,870
green phosphors to the blazer era

1277
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:57,690
but I still have

1278
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:01,500
the video of my first pc 80

1279
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,020
86 gold still working in the warehouses  na what when you turn it on it does

1280
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,210
have

1281
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:08,280
a bit like the groping you put I don't know

1282
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,560
if it would explode now it would use it

1283
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,110
to put the air from that do

1284
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:15,120
and height is however I guarantee you that

1285
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,590
I still have it there and I think it is

1286
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:17,970
formally one of the last ones left

1287
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:20,959
on the face of the earth

1288
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,790
a note of color we talk about

1289
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,010
coupler

1290
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:27,230
acoustic couplers

1291
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:32,250
modem at 300 baud I have never

1292
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,620
tried but there were people who,

1293
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,990
whistling, managed to negotiate the

1294
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:39,470
carrier

1295
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:44,359
legend legend no no it's true it's true

1296
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:54,420
no that's another thing for  boxing

1297
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,030
because in the United States the

1298
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:00,310
communication between the exchanges took place

1299
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:03,190
in bands, i.e. on the same channel on

1300
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:05,170
which the phone calls were made, so as

1301
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:07,300
on which he moved by voice as he said

1302
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,390
there were also

1303
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:13,349
mechanical whistles then subsequently

1304
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:15,790
small electronic devices that

1305
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:18,099
they generated these tones and

1306
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:20,140
therefore allowed to control the remote control unit,

1307
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:23,230
however, if for love because this is a

1308
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:25,240
written legend  everywhere that it is

1309
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,310
true that the whistle that came out with the

1310
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,109
fries of captain cross, however captain

1311
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:31,690
france told us personally that it is

1312
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:34,329
a half legend in the sense that it is true

1313
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:35,940
that that whistle

1314
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,890
comes close to 2006 which was the

1315
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:41,290
first tone 2006  it was the first 12 they

1316
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:42,760
also did the magazine etcetera etcetera

1317
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,950
but a search on however said that it

1318
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:50,200
is a bit of a legend let's say it is part of the

1319
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,109
legend it is part of the legend

1320
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:55,599
however yes let's say the tone that hour

1321
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,359
2006 on the waves shakey yo personally

1322
00:56:58,359 --> 00:57:00,760
or I think it may  be counted among

1323
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,060
the urban legends

1324
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,240
almost the hand on fire

1325
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,859
a legend instead that is pure reality

1326
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:11,920
because I managed to do it too and

1327
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,020
in Italy we had telecom that never

1328
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,780
passed the tone selection but

1329
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,670
still had the charge solution that is  a

1330
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,020
switch that opens and closes

1331
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,810
rather than a couple of tones that

1332
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:26,260
defines a cisa and if working in

1333
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,119
companies that had the first PBX

1334
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:30,069
switchboards had to do with it

1335
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:31,869
the interface you had the phone the

1336
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:34,000
wheel that someone was taking care of

1337
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,869
you saw you in the landfill to take

1338
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:40,750
control of the external line you did

1339
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,630
zero when the wheel came back

1340
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,790
because the impulses were made

1341
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,650
when you go back give a

1342
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:50,290
tap  ring road to the wheel you did

1343
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:54,069
the eleven not the zero it was the 10 of

1344
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:56,319
western and international so

1345
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:59,520
some of these things are not legends after

1346
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,670


1347
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,500
italy as regards the bills present

1348
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,780
here in italy there was before the was

1349
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,090
a single rate

1350
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,740
and therefore let's say  there it went

1351
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:19,350
pretty well then the

1352
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,750
so-called tariffs began everything but urban

1353
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,510
always in urban it was whole urban it

1354
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:28,320
was never reaffirmed I swear to the

1355
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,360
urban it was really an

1356
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,580
incredible blow that is in the sense

1357
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,830
my mother who is Venetian I am Abruzzo wine

1358
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:37,170
that she  I phone every day from the

1359
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,300
wind so you imagine the bills

1360
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,280
were already expensive and of course she was

1361
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,350
pissed off as it was said why

1362
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,600
obviously those who had a telephone because

1363
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,430
not everyone had a telephone in the

1364
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:50,400
house there was only one and obviously there

1365
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,250
will be no cordless phone that happened

1366
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,930
to be trying to find in the evening because

1367
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:56,580
maybe there was also such a

1368
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,890
reduced rate for which my mother calls

1369
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,540
in the evening instead the

1370
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,950
phone was always busy because in the afternoon

1371
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:03,930
if the fairy tales to the kids for at least 3 4

1372
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:07,440
hours in the evening some bbs was attached

1373
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,990
goodnight to the bucket

1374
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:12,540
on this we can do a seminar what

1375
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,700
still the serious bedini free urgent

1376
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,680
onwards who was there  architect with the duplex

1377
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,240
there are people who obviously then

1378
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,530
also made money with the

1379
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,900
telephone tokens were these tokens which then

1380
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,280
at a certain point no better link II

1381
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,800
year was I think it starts in the

1382
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,960
eighties present from 50 lire have passed

1383
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,020
at 100 lire for which the famous boys

1384
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,550
went around with boxes full

1385
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:38,040
of tokens to be put in bursts they

1386
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,870
found their capital doubled

1387
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:43,430
there was d  we have one as per neutral

1388
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,230
for the tariffs a bit of clarity there was

1389
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:47,840
the sip there was nothing else it was from the

1390
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,540
state and it was a public company and had

1391
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,460
a single rate for local calls

1392
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,740
, i.e. within its own

1393
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,600
telephone district  and you did not have to

1394
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,760
do the prefix that is, if you call them in

1395
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,760
pescara 085 you did not make

1396
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,000
the number only

1397
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,290
if called outside your area code

1398
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:11,780
based on the region where you were calling there were

1399
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,250
trains they made three pages

1400
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:15,470
on the list that explained what

1401
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:17,840
we knew  all by heart

1402
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,940
then at a certain point they let in

1403
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:23,350
the all-time urban rate

1404
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:26,150
then they are the campaigns to abolish it the

1405
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:29,240
suit was an ass because for those who did it

1406
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,700
also for not only because she had the bbs

1407
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,130
but also for the mother who spoke five

1408
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,470
hours at the  phone with my aunt because before

1409
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:39,950
there was a click after which instead and the

1410
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:42,680
rates varied according to the

1411
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,720
call times for which there was

1412
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,180
a low-cost time slot which was the night in which

1413
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,830
all the  call

1414
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:50,360
the problem what was that if you were a

1415
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,280
site of a network as a net wire

1416
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,960
what I mentioned earlier

1417
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,120
you who were the site did not make

1418
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,640
local calls because you had to get

1419
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,980
the post at least in the district you are

1420
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,750
next to me I have to  call the eagle

1421
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:05,090
and teramo to send the mail we can the

1422
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:07,250
perticara to get some networks from

1423
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,260
samuele samuele called me and there was

1424
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,750
a whole night scheduler of calls

1425
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,970
and I called gino lucro and marco

1426
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:17,720
cipriani who was lab 600 abruzzese

1427
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,300
so it was he who  he had the mail and

1428
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,340
therefore there were all built-in

1429
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,840
mechanisms to make this mail

1430
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,850
run well and spend as little as

1431
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:29,000
possible but I assure you that all over

1432
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,650
the world because then all this stuff

1433
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:33,290
was one there were pyramid calls

1434
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,630
at the beginning  and then pyramid calls in the

1435
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,310
morning in such a way that the mail

1436
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:39,110
to the sent everyone sent it

1437
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:41,090
sent to the Italian lab that sent it

1438
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:43,370
abroad and all took back the

1439
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,260
usual mail for the

1440
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:46,880
gera structure  rchica that there were

1441
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,530
but the rates were fundamental and I

1442
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:51,350
assure you that having a b bs

1443
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,730
then as regards this type of calls

1444
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,209
which is not that box box avi to call

1445
01:01:55,209 --> 01:01:57,609
cipriani it was not possible where to make the

1446
01:01:57,609 --> 01:01:59,289
prefix of those calls cipriani

1447
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:01,569
pay then box  ali if you wanted to go to

1448
01:02:01,569 --> 01:02:04,329
composer see things for other

1449
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:07,599
things you could save but on these

1450
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:08,950
things here it was a loss-making investment of

1451
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:12,369
course you suspended the money point of

1452
01:02:12,369 --> 01:02:15,670
bills were bills also were

1453
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,259
bills also salty in fact then

1454
01:02:17,259 --> 01:02:19,719
there were financing campaigns of the

1455
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:22,719
bbs  there is someone who asked at times

1456
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,249
only simple donations at other

1457
01:02:24,249 --> 01:02:26,440
times there were private areas with the

1458
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,239
software to be financed to

1459
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:30,579
finance all this hobby

1460
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:32,200
this to get a little clear then at a

1461
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,359
certain point they privatized it

1462
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:36,700
became telecom kept the  all

1463
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,769
for a period after which the

1464
01:02:38,769 --> 01:02:40,569
privatization there was what you

1465
01:02:40,569 --> 01:02:42,209
know

1466
01:02:42,209 --> 01:02:45,629
connection fee

1467
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:58,559
how many 3 no I don't know

1468
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,579
I think  that is not a k

1469
01:03:02,829 --> 01:03:05,650
the scene yesterday's world games scene

1470
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:08,739
you see the characters appearing one

1471
01:03:08,739 --> 01:03:10,299
at a time on the screen those

1472
01:03:10,299 --> 01:03:13,569
perfectly matthew broderick puts the

1473
01:03:13,569 --> 01:03:15,489
handset in a mega he copied the

1474
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:17,529
acoustics that went to 14 and 4 i think

1475
01:03:17,529 --> 01:03:19,869
it is l  'the only one in the world that went to the

1476
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:22,059
one that never sold but

1477
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:23,769
when you went with an applicator with an

1478
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:25,420
acoustic copy that could go to

1479
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,369
a maximum of 300 booms sometimes it

1480
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:29,130
went 110

1481
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:31,779
more to see the characters one at a

1482
01:03:31,779 --> 01:03:34,150
time forming on the line and  when he

1483
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:36,279
went to head he finally says away what he

1484
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:39,729
will say in the line after this is another

1485
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:42,390
thing that perhaps was not cleared

1486
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:44,140
another thing that perhaps is not the

1487
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,599
clarity was this that before the

1488
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:49,420
speech bbs if you have to send a file

1489
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,640
somewhere c  'was the problem that

1490
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:54,039
had to be agreed that you had to

1491
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:56,739
have a line scanned no wait for the

1492
01:03:56,739 --> 01:03:58,390
call which then after the way in

1493
01:03:58,390 --> 01:04:00,039
answered then you called the other

1494
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:01,839
always answered that in the meantime he did not

1495
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,249
call  your grandmother or things like this

1496
01:04:03,249 --> 01:04:04,339


1497
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:06,170
then start the transfer even after

1498
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:08,539
there was the famous z modem a great

1499
01:04:08,539 --> 01:04:09,920
evolution because you didn't have to start the

1500
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,779
game immediately it averaged the

1501
01:04:11,779 --> 01:04:14,180
speed it did some things but the

1502
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:16,160
great coolness of when the son of node was born

1503
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,960
trust that in reality you had

1504
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,029
a third party who was always there so in

1505
01:04:20,029 --> 01:04:22,039
fact you could send this stuff there and

1506
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:24,079
the other one went to get it seems like

1507
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:25,549
a beast but it's a big difference

1508
01:04:25,549 --> 01:04:27,440
because you didn't have to have on the other side

1509
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,079
then not only  sometimes maybe you made

1510
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,670
the call it went down maybe the line

1511
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:32,719
was poor

1512
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:34,430
I don't know what but after two or three calls

1513
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:37,339
maybe ended up on the decent channel for

1514
01:04:37,339 --> 01:04:38,509
example the thing that capital from

1515
01:04:38,509 --> 01:04:40,309
crisis providers could the first modem

1516
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:42,680
for example so even if you called you

1517
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,210
felt that it answered then it did not go  a

1518
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:45,799
cabbage

1519
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,779
maybe after a couple of calls you ended up

1520
01:04:47,779 --> 01:04:49,369
on another modem and here at that

1521
01:04:49,369 --> 01:04:52,219
point things worked and for the

1522
01:04:52,219 --> 01:04:53,869
season this is a nice thing because I find

1523
01:04:53,869 --> 01:04:55,420
ourselves  vavamo the bible is full of stuff

1524
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:58,059
also interesting

1525
01:04:58,059 --> 01:05:00,619
of one thing that speed and at an

1526
01:05:00,619 --> 01:05:03,559
exotic hardware post it was ok there was the porn

1527
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:05,119
there was the images but with the resources but

1528
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:06,799
how did they get the images

1529
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,660
into these systems we do not chat

1530
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:10,789
and  the photos in jpeg

1531
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:13,910
I had a comfortable 64 with the modem and

1532
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,680
I also had a somewhat strange device

1533
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,989
which is a digitizer practically

1534
01:05:17,989 --> 01:05:20,269
in the same way as 64 you could ok connect the

1535
01:05:20,269 --> 01:05:22,339
modem attached the bbs try more

1536
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:24,140
attack the visitor which is a

1537
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:26,239
black box with two  white wheels

1538
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:28,210
where careful brightness and sync

1539
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:31,219
sticks off a camera

1540
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:33,739
with composite video and has to appear

1541
01:05:33,739 --> 01:05:35,599
over four nearly dot-to-

1542
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,869
dot lines and completes veils and

1543
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:41,029
completes the big picture after

1544
01:05:41,029 --> 01:05:43,190
ten minutes standing there for  take

1545
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:46,249
a photo of you or point something

1546
01:05:46,249 --> 01:05:48,380
you had the whole image is then

1547
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,660
that of being able to send things so

1548
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:53,739
I think the famous ones are squares the

1549
01:05:53,739 --> 01:05:57,410
teams then they think it happened

1550
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:00,339
and  then so

1551
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:04,310
I don't know but once it was done so

1552
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:08,150
there is scanning point by point and then in

1553
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:11,170
via v with modena

1554
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:15,050
so a couple of things neuro answer

1555
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,750
why and why we are here talking about it to

1556
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:20,150
me it seems personally an episode of

1557
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:23,030
rai history in the  sense that anyone in here

1558
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:25,420
niche that sadness

1559
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:30,100
rai story rai

1560
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:33,410
exact story but not only the nice thing about rai

1561
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:36,650
story was the contrast we are giving

1562
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:40,030
to it that is all those above the door

1563
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:43,420
without effort

1564
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:44,990
tell exactly what

1565
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:46,460
happened as in the black and white movies

1566
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:49,250
black of the 60s in which speech and

1567
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:50,990
attention

1568
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:55,040
before 85 in red so

1569
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,690
communications did not exist

1570
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:58,460
what he said so in practice

1571
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:01,280
you could only know something about your

1572
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,180
city he lived there you were in person and

1573
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,640
the library was your point

1574
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:10,520
reference if cooperating a book

1575
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,040
abroad

1576
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,070
was a business the credit card

1577
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:17,990
sending a fax to america was

1578
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:20,690
impossible there was something for which if

1579
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:24,370
you want something you have to do it  ttare to have it

1580
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:27,820
and and they arrived already versa

1581
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:30,740
if you did arrive etcetera

1582
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:33,080
is the discourse for which we are

1583
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,950
used to a logic of

1584
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:38,240
we have had the

1585
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,860
opportunity to communicate one by one and

1586
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:42,860
one to many no longer in the same place

1587
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:45,920
with the mimeograph but to  distance which is

1588
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,890
something that is now taken for granted

1589
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:50,180
absolutely for granted once if

1590
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:52,820
I wanted to say something to him I had to

1591
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,560
call you and agree to

1592
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,820
be in the same place for a

1593
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:59,090
beer if I pass something a paper pack

1594
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:01,240


1595
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,790
yes

1596
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:07,340
no no but you become  mental ventilation of the

1597
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,320
greens health a slaughterhouse as well as going

1598
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,630
abroad interrail rather than

1599
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:14,950
ryanair are two things

1600
01:08:16,189 --> 01:08:20,080
exactly was that and then

1601
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,160
we say that in that way we have

1602
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,049
experienced we have understood how

1603
01:08:24,049 --> 01:08:26,390
to make the most of a device of that

1604
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,060
wonderful kind with the given field

1605
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,640
rather  that and there is a number of

1606
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,729
different dynamics with respect to

1607
01:08:33,729 --> 01:08:35,450
consumer electronics which is

1608
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:38,089
given from my point of view then

1609
01:08:38,089 --> 01:08:40,149
another side passage another side topic

1610
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:43,609
to this since in any case

1611
01:08:43,609 --> 01:08:44,529
for me

1612
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:47,390
despite having to download a

1613
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:50,630
driver you would telephone that is to try to understand

1614
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,899
where it was from the

1615
01:08:53,899 --> 01:08:56,630
telephone numbers of the magazines of the

1616
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,420
foreign magazines the colleagues and the bbs of the

1617
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:02,420
of the zeit sel rather  that in america

1618
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:05,810
and you download the file from there trying to

1619
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,700
bypass the switchboard in the company

1620
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,010
casino della madonna it was definitely

1621
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:10,990
impossible to

1622
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:13,130
get such rava or even if on the

1623
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:15,680
computer that I read irregularly

1624
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,350
because I could not box every

1625
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:20,839
day what amigas were used for for that

1626
01:09:20,839 --> 01:09:22,069
because  a much better sound card

1627
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:25,339
6 my side jump

1628
01:09:25,339 --> 01:09:27,020
at the time when I too was arguing with

1629
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:30,439
that technology was when there was

1630
01:09:30,439 --> 01:09:32,510
another reality that was communicating

1631
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:36,140
one to many one by one and between

1632
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:38,410
data traffic in an equally way

1633
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:40,880
experience of 1200

1634
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,160
was the homeland 3 god was the radio

1635
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,649
twenty five years ago 25 leaf took the

1636
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:48,410
license of the radio vapo  re and I had

1637
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:51,500
moved some of my

1638
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,960
traffic to that channel like

1639
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,370
how many coaches did

1640
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:57,500
then when it came online video

1641
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,410
everyone moved beyond so the father

1642
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:03,050
god and teletype all the form of

1643
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:05,930
transmission we had done  beyond was

1644
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:08,930
the economic answer to this in fact

1645
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:11,630
they tell you how far away then talk

1646
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:14,150
to your radio I can call my uncle

1647
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:18,300
in australia and I draw exactly and if he

1648
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:21,930
can download the files with

1649
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:23,610
what the vintage radio package was

1650
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:27,420
one of the  alternatives and digital natives

1651
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,610
are you lodo instead saw they

1652
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:31,260
gave it to others this native appeal of

1653
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,180
who the [ __ ] is digital native you are

1654
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:35,000
digital native not the guys

1655
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,750
demonstrating what they are

1656
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:39,719
considering wait always wait we will be

1657
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:41,550
the digital natives

1658
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,830
waiting for what here I can  to say one thing

1659
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:46,590
about digital video is

1660
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:49,560
a bad word bordering on insult

1661
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,620
that is it does not mean ignorant but in short,

1662
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:55,500
semi-illiterate s  simply because but

1663
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:56,460


1664
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,010
ignorance is right it means you don't know you

1665
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:01,260
are not an [ __ ] if you have never

1666
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,570
needed to deal with

1667
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:08,030
technology you take it for granted that

1668
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,280
the finger and rightly what is

1669
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,190
underneath moves

1670
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:17,070
another note neuron  neuro sorry you have

1671
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:20,670
become very good over time with an

1672
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:22,440
eye because I remember

1673
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,349
that there were stop responding via an

1674
01:11:25,349 --> 01:11:28,429
amen on a message in a forum

1675
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:30,530
quoting everything

1676
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:34,170
and replying I agree that

1677
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:36,389
person there was taken home if yours

1678
01:11:36,389 --> 01:11:38,340
daughter said ti quoto ti quoto

1679
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:41,489
explicit and says major major

1680
01:11:41,489 --> 01:11:44,550
major major I agree it did not

1681
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,570
pass but I had joker comet come

1682
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:50,880
point all the pictures how many [ __ ]

1683
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,679
times I had to put it from a considerable

1684
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:54,449
if I was to be good for folic  of the

1685
01:11:54,449 --> 01:11:56,010
nails loris of the mini logical how then you

1686
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:59,210
reasoned impossible

1687
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:02,159
if with good force I had to be or if not

1688
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,559
I have to close everyone then from everyone and

1689
01:12:04,559 --> 01:12:07,230
then one thing is what is left of

1690
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,750
this city then qu  a we are

1691
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:12,539
all doors in short I would say more or less he

1692
01:12:12,539 --> 01:12:16,889
no he no you see it is a lot here then

1693
01:12:16,889 --> 01:12:18,809
next year I will practically 30

1694
01:12:18,809 --> 01:12:20,489
years doing this job and I

1695
01:12:20,489 --> 01:12:22,320
like it as I like it from the first day and

1696
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,119
I enjoy the soul as you do  I enjoyed the first

1697
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:26,519
day and I think what we have

1698
01:12:26,519 --> 01:12:28,440
in common is probably that if we are

1699
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,480
here it is also precisely because so I

1700
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,539
wish you in thirty years

1701
01:12:32,539 --> 01:12:35,070
to have the same situation that is to

1702
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:37,409
go to the haq meeting of I don't know where that

1703
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:39,119
will be done in  so who can not even in the

1704
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:41,000
least imagine given the trend

1705
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,710
but here is probably on mars I do not know

1706
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:45,059
what you will connect the space station by

1707
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:47,579
piercing some site because that

1708
01:12:47,579 --> 01:12:49,170
way you spend less etc. etc.

1709
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:51,599
I do not know but the concept is that I

1710
01:12:51,599 --> 01:12:54,179
hope this continues as it was

1711
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:56,130
for us a great satisfaction

1712
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:58,019
and then not only because you don't believe me

1713
01:12:58,019 --> 01:12:59,429
the other day I gutted that

1714
01:12:59,429 --> 01:13:00,599
they looked at all the [ __ ] you

1715
01:13:00,599 --> 01:13:03,150
did but you don't think

1716
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:05,130
you have cash  we made monori that obviously

1717
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,679
there was once upon a time with the tools of the

1718
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,840
time and the idiot did it in a

1719
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,610
different system today the yachts you make a

1720
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:14,460
more advanced system but the idiot continues to

1721
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,900
be an idiot and this is one thing  very

1722
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:20,808
positive we left a tradition

1723
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,520
you can also tell us a little bit about the

1724
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,349
passage that has been there because until

1725
01:13:29,349 --> 01:13:30,760
now we have talked about what

1726
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,969
there was and we know what there is the

1727
01:13:33,969 --> 01:13:35,940
passage

1728
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,469
in the passage there are some

1729
01:13:38,469 --> 01:13:40,750
dramatic things of the type that there are  the

1730
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,250
moments when you realize that

1731
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:43,599
everything that is studied on a certain thing

1732
01:13:43,599 --> 01:13:45,310
you don't need a [ __ ] anymore and this is

1733
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:48,639
unfortunately a constant in the work of

1734
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:49,739


1735
01:13:49,739 --> 01:13:52,690
happy computer scientists now I do a ass like this to

1736
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:56,199
learn what I know abel when you talked

1737
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:58,420
about the doss each  of us there were the

1738
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:02,489
wizards of the conflict point ssis and of the

1739
01:14:02,489 --> 01:14:04,860
outback point bat

1740
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:08,310
where everyone has his

1741
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:11,380
satisfactions studied is your great position of

1742
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:15,750
power collapsed miserably and so

1743
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:18,639
on evolution the  transition between

1744
01:14:18,639 --> 01:14:22,860
amateur telematics and the internet was

1745
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:27,630
gradual and in some ways

1746
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:31,599
even many passed over without

1747
01:14:31,599 --> 01:14:33,389
them noticing

1748
01:14:33,389 --> 01:14:35,739
many of us with this thing

1749
01:14:35,739 --> 01:14:37,300
they made us a profession

1750
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:40,360
now I am a little younger than the

1751
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:44,170
average so I failed to  a hair the

1752
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:46,420
new economy instead of being

1753
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,099
an entrepreneur at the time I was a

1754
01:14:48,099 --> 01:14:53,040
student but many bbs have become

1755
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,050
internet providers key b more

1756
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:58,750
successful than less for example ng

1757
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:02,590
which is now quite a power mc

1758
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:04,540
link that even if it had some

1759
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,670
peculiarities I was a bin node  very

1760
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,099
important

1761
01:15:08,099 --> 01:15:12,849
galactic the third I wanted to mention and

1762
01:15:12,849 --> 01:15:15,719
what else

1763
01:15:16,949 --> 01:15:21,639
agora rightly agora and in any case

1764
01:15:21,639 --> 01:15:24,989
many made a profession out of it at the time

1765
01:15:24,989 --> 01:15:28,079
there were still some

1766
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:31,699
amateur or semi amateur systems with

1767
01:15:31,699 --> 01:15:34,940
internet access there was saab link that

1768
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:37,880
had organized itself to post news  with

1769
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,270
ucp first from the netherlands then from the united states it

1770
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,520
was basically a

1771
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,909
cooperative provider competing with unit chi

1772
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,710
was the only Italian commercial provider

1773
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:50,290


1774
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:55,990
several stops at the time had become

1775
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:59,360
providers at the time there were no grt

1776
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:03,920
obviously one could order a trunk

1777
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,600
of telephone lines from the sip

1778
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,000
a pile of modems on a

1779
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,640
metal shelf from the cellar a bit of servers to

1780
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,510
attach them to a

1781
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:20,920
fractional cdn type 128 256

1782
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,850
kb of an ai

1783
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:28,520
164 to start even how many users there

1784
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,540
were in 64 kb it

1785
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:35,890
cost from several million per month

1786
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:39,230
and in this way many have become

1787
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:42,380
small local providers then the adsl

1788
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,450
have wiped out this reality

1789
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:46,850
for various reasons

1790
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:49,460
now  this thing is reviving

1791
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:52,010
in another way with various

1792
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:55,250
wireless operators who come from another world

1793
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:58,220
that of antennas often

1794
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,520
do they

1795
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:03,350
make new small local providers

1796
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:05,720
at the time many bbs had become

1797
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:10,540
these I then two years later in

1798
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:13,670
95 I had the  my first

1799
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:17,300
internet connection in the newsgroups i met

1800
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:20,840
other other people i already knew in

1801
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,270
fidonet and this thing here went

1802
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:26,080
on even  a for about 45 years

1803
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,700
after which

1804
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:31,490


1805
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:34,030
flat connections

1806
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:37,640
for internet and revenue sharing began to spread for which

1807
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,950
you only paid the time rate however

1808
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:42,650
then the adsl arrived that

1809
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:46,430
definitively killed every every bbs

1810
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:48,560
because obviously it made no sense to

1811
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,290
connect a bbs  when there was the internet

1812
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:53,330
that had technically

1813
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:55,990
better protocols a better speed

1814
01:17:55,990 --> 01:18:00,380
there was much more freedom amp almost real

1815
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:03,050
time or even real time but there was much

1816
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:05,270
more freedom than in the management of trust

1817
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:08,330
which had its advantages and disadvantages

1818
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:11,360
but in any case not  aims let

1819
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,030
's say the total anarchy of now but there were

1820
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:16,760
still for example the newsgroups that the

1821
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,470
first years had an

1822
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:20,600
important quality so there was this

1823
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,200
gradual transition people slowly

1824
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:28,220
disappeared lele bbs slowly closed

1825
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:31,220
for example I don't  I remember a certain

1826
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:35,600
moment the coordinator of rome of

1827
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,200
lazio closed all within three

1828
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,790
days because he was hired by

1829
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:42,740
italia online I think that's all  ra the head

1830
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:46,809
of security of jol

1831
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,560
we have to close they tell us about

1832
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,980
Reggio

1833
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:54,490
however I have a recommendation

1834
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:56,390
recommendation simply because for

1835
01:18:56,390 --> 01:19:00,410
the various vicissitudes of life it happened

1836
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:01,910
that following the collapse of the

1837
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:05,480
olive groves I have been a trainer on technology for years

1838
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,590


1839
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:09,070
those of you who have had  the good fortune

1840
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:13,400
to reproduce and therefore have digital natives

1841
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,460
in the house

1842
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:18,320
do not try to explain the technology

1843
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,600
for charity do not talk to them about the

1844
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,840
punch cards of the acoustic companions

1845
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:26,270
to the limit with an excuse but you to see

1846
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:29,180
the world games and then start from there but

1847
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:31,700
if you want that  can understand something

1848
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:34,310
of what happens in the world of

1849
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:36,440
telematics even if only interested in the

1850
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,440
latest iphone

1851
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,870
explain the history the technology

1852
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:44,690
let you make a conscious effort

1853
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:47,330
not to whistle like a modem and try to

1854
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:50,060
explain to them what it meant at the time to

1855
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:54,230
be able to talk to the  abroad where you

1856
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:56,909
appropriate things simply

1857
01:19:56,909 --> 01:19:59,520
because they could not be bought  re even if

1858
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,650
you had money you wanted to buy yourself a

1859
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:05,790
connection x25 you could not do it

1860
01:20:05,790 --> 01:20:08,030
there was no category of private use of

1861
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:10,320
information technology try to explain

1862
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,020
this because it may be that they are only

1863
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:15,239
interested in the thing and do not

1864
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:17,540
take you for fools that is the situation

1865
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,980
normal that happens when someone

1866
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,500
tries to explain something that in

1867
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,600
quotation marks we can call a piece of

1868
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,699
history to people who have not lived it

1869
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:44,120
to my mom
