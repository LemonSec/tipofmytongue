1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
there is a project

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,879
wait we talked about it first of all

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:12,530
if what I told him more or less at the time

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,640
globaleaks is a project that aims to

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,699
provide a kind of framework for

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,330
sharing information and

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,830
sharing validation of

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,449
information that can  being in the

9
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,279
public domain, however, of public

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,880
utility is not a good definition bad

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,860
not bad especially for the definition

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,200
of framework because well

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,329
globalist in synthesis born after

14
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,670
we understood that illustrious blogging

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,100
was always trying something more

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,950
interesting and significant in the

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,420
society of the future

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,100
as  so many data although significant

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,989
for public opinion and these data

20
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,280
could easily be kept

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,620
hidden rather than could

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,809
arouse many people to hear of

23
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,430
many ministry professionals never

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,000
knowing and after the bowl gate case it

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,250
became clear that a

26
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,630
wikileaks mechanism could never

27
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,950
work  because he had done

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,100
something a little too much  o big for anyone and the

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,740
natural defense of the structures in the

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,680
network is to distribute yes therefore to be able

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,390
to create many small elements that

32
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,009
can devote themselves to

33
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,829
specialized things and no longer have the

34
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:30,299
centralized element to almost all

35
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,880
refer to this was the idea

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,650
initial but instead we discovered that

37
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,329
these blooming and is much more is not

38
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,630
only the technical-political activism

39
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,020
of wikileaks but it is a lot of support

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,490
for investigative tourism like the

41
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,290
traditional one that has always existed and a

42
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,470
lot of corporate transparency because even

43
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,780
within small  medium and large

44
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,530
companies

45
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,430
there is the fact that

46
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,590
yes what are they bad and you should

47
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,490
bring something bad to your boss

48
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,710
but maybe it was he who

49
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,540
had been going badly because he is corrupt

50
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,310
because he is bullying, however, being

51
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,770
able to talk about it in a confidential way

52
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,199
someone from outside  internally can help them

53
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,940


54
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,310
and thus also applied to the public

55
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,050
administration so as

56
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,000
we have discovered these things  here he

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,100
said well I loved to see that louis blues swing

58
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,870
is not a julian assange instrument but it is

59
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,030
something much older and in

60
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,950
fact it was, however, to be discovered everything

61
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,430
gradually and this we take down for which

62
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,050
framework is perhaps the proof that most

63
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,180
enhances our work  and now he passes

64
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,920
the word to arturo who will continue from

65
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,560
one thing to add is that between let's say

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,660
the limits that we have identified in

67
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,239
wikileaks there was also the fact that

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,760
wikileaks was in charge of doing many things

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,209
went from managing the infrastructure

70
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,400
developing the software that is  behind

71
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,920
this infrastructure there is then the analysis

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,560
of the tip of the materials that are

73
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,799
collected through their

74
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:02,680
submission platform then has the publication for

75
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,830
which we have actually decided to

76
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,530
deal with a more specific

77
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,840
more technical aspect to develop a software that

78
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,610
can then be  managed by

79
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,730
other people still other people can

80
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,100
deal with the analysis of the material that is

81
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,739
collected through this platform and

82
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:23,320
then some  n other, perhaps even different

83
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,250
from the three previous actors, takes care of

84
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,450
publishing it and making sure that the

85
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,180
analyzes of these documents reach

86
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,260
the public and at this point I would

87
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,299
show a little how how

88
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:40,180
globaleaks actually works among the

89
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,060
technologies at the basis of globaleaks there

90
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,160
are the  tori del service

91
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,350
this means that those who manage a

92
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,000
globaleaks node can also choose

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,310
to remain anonymous

94
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,900
this means that there is no ppd

95
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,329
machine that I can attack or which I can

96
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,200
connect to

97
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,829
a natural person this means that

98
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:07,829
a system that collects information

99
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,870
perhaps on the  mafia where the person who

100
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,790
manages the node could potentially

101
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,650
risk his

102
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,850
life can do it safely they are

103
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,399
anonymous but still facilitate access to

104
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,699
this system which otherwise would remain

105
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,810
reserved for only nerds and

106
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,000
people who in short already know thor is

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,099
exposed on the network  internet through

108
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:37,870
another technology we develop which

109
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,610
is called wrong we  b which we will then talk about

110
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,250
later which basically deals with

111
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,780
creating a transport between the darknet

112
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,750
thor network and the normal internet network so

113
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,360
when I visit a globaleaks site

114
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,330
I don't actually have to

115
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,460
enter the onion point but I can also

116
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,090
visit an address in  clear https

117
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,040
no thanks

118
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,390
then that's the point this i answer with

119
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,950
microphone bottom with microphone respect

120
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:36,700
as that is wrong web and the software is a

121
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,800
software that like thor can be

122
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,440
used by various users on the internet

123
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,330
to form new web pie to

124
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,760
make sure that if  they take down our

125
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,660
web wrong our let's say

126
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,550
main node our way of this

127
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,400
software there are also others known as they

128
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,490
could be to make a

129
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,150
parallel example of the other exit med of tor

130
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,850
of the other entry points and in this case

131
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,540
wrong web which are not of  of hermes but they

132
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,310
are of other users around the web

133
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,250
who should pull down all

134
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:22,190
those who to succeed yes

135
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,850


136
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,810
absolutely like yes but que  I am happens

137
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,460
through a series of web twisted nodes in

138
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,590
which you to be a twisted web and

139
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,110
therefore an entry point between the internet and the

140
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,990
deep web install no install the

141
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,389
web torte software that it takes someone

142
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:46,610
who runs the strong web software to

143
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,380
allow  people to reach

144
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,260
these well series is the opposite of a

145
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,280
pie med exit is an

146
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:07,850
internet entry tortures itself allows you to

147
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,610
reach the known who would

148
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,530
otherwise be inside the darknet

149
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,460
so rightly has to who has a client

150
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,169
or what is relevant is that

151
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:22,789
our architecture has foreseen a

152
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:25,910
pato mechanism on the back end and clai and

153
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,590
front end so we have a back end that

154
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,060
speaks of the most airest and of a client

155
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,620
instead benetton javascript which is

156
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,720
only exchanged on these guides

157
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,610
what I was showing here was an example

158
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,850
of the  epia and basic that throws you between a

159
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,650
knot this because he will have to think about the

160
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,300
fact that the knots do not

161
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,380
yet have co, however, they are

162
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,700
single initiatives that are created  and from having

163
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,620
users where is the list of

164
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,349
globaleaks initiatives here on wikipedia

165
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,229
for the moment any way these nodes that

166
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:06,050
want to advertise themselves must do it

167
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,650
autonomously

168
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,620
imagine that instead in a

169
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,539
fairly close future because obviously I

170
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:16,130
melfi with the new line of development of

171
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,050
next 18 months it

172
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,330
will also be possible to have an index of

173
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,889
nodes that exist so that it will be

174
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,470
easier for those who want to look for an

175
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,200
appropriate way of this blogging or who

176
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,270
as a journalist wants to offer

177
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,889
to review some documents to

178
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:32,958
find all the existing nodes to understand

179
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,159
what the

180
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,350
corresponding keywords the languages supported

181
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,360
the tor jali rules that the various nodesses

182
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,659
give and this thing here will be an element

183
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,980
released by an ep ai public which

184
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,170
can therefore be more easily

185
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:50,250
collected in an index is verified

186
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,100
over time how a node behaves  and

187
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,800
party etc. so we imagine a

188
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,410
future in which the whistle blower who has

189
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,480
something to report to gods

190
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,580
documents to some material knows something

191
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,690
does not have to make so much effort to

192
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,340
be able to find the

193
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,840
best recipient for that type of information

194
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,970
but can directly query a certain

195
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,250
service and say I know this

196
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,440
something to who it is that I have to go and

197
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,970
mark it to that  point will get an

198
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,350
answer perhaps even with a

199
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,090
reputation system of comments feedback

200
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,580
etc. and will then be able to choose the

201
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,960
most pertinent globaleaks node to his

202
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,950
type of submission to the type of material

203
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,030
he has to send

204
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:46,590
I would like to return to the topic on his

205
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,710
motivations that led us  to

206
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,710
develop globaleaks and then see if

207
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,170
we have if what we have done is

208
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,880
that we initially thought then

209
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,020
it applied in practice when we

210
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,480
thought global we started from

211
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,820
wikileaks from a centralized model in

212
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,640
which it identifies we identified a

213
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,530
problem and mainly from a technical point of

214
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,690
view because  the centralized knot and scent

215
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,460
was easily

216
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,500
attacked under goes  re points of view

217
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,420
simply from the

218
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,480
financial or alt point of view for which we

219
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,730
thought about how we could suffer from

220
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,770
this problem by creating something

221
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,960
centralized initially even the

222
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,130
first ruminations were about

223
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,660
how to achieve software decentralization by

224
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,910
thinking about making a

225
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,880
distributed database  or anything else

226
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,260
then instead it was really understood that

227
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,940
this decentralization of

228
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,280
centralization of a rather

229
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,880
cultural type in the sense that it goes balich

230
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,690
wikileaks received material

231
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,170
from all over the world but very much allows

232
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,180
because of this it has received material has

233
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,680
centered on if even the enemies of everything

234
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,430
the world

235
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,620
while not knowing how to

236
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,190
specifically analyze the material that received

237
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,800
example had received mafia

238
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,100
or camorra material how could it have

239
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,850
discerned what is good and what is

240
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,420
wrong so precisely the idea

241
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,040
was to create a site where

242
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,400
decentralization was implemented

243
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,860
allowing  that various initiatives

244
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,830
may arise  and in an easy way here and there

245
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,839
in the world and among the various

246
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:40,460
decentralization concepts that we have inserted

247
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,570
in the software

248
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,400
we have inserted a decentralization

249
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,690
based on different types of responsibilities

250
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,910
in the node so in any case we have

251
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,589
foreseen that there was an administrator

252
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:54,110
who is that person or that  group that

253
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,050
pulls on the initiative and that does not

254
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,880
even have the visibility on the sides that

255
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,770
this person receives simply yes

256
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:07,630
I do not know what we can show how

257
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,320
you could slide the knot remo this person

258
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,960
trivially admitted on the initiative in

259
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,710
some way has made an

260
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,380
advertisement of the initiative

261
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,900
depending on the resources at his disposal

262
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,850
if he is an anonymous person or

263
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,820
he allowed me to put flyers on a

264
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,089
bulletin board

265
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,300
here and there by not signing himself in any

266
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,240
way if he is a person if instead he is a

267
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,480
media he may have used

268
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,940
media channels such as newspapers such as  the

269
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,870
newspapers rather than the

270
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,890
televisions and christa then

271
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,080
the administrator puts on the knot and the

272
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,820
spritz  in addition to doing this

273
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:07,310
the administrator configures on the

274
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,730
node those who are the recipients of the

275
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,510
material what you see here for

276
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,360
example is our demo node where

277
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,790
damn it is possible to create a

278
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,180
receiver called m center configured

279
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,410
with an email from the group or a

280
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,890
specific journalist  in this case the

281
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,710
name one of the members of our

282
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,000
association

283
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:45,890
just so to make the recipients on

284
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,370
who receive the material of the way the

285
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,920
only ones authorized to receive it the other

286
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,750
user the application and the whistle

287
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,830
blower that is the one who ends up on the one who

288
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,040
browses the  application once he becomes

289
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,230
aware of it through one of

290
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:11,150
the media channels he accesses it and can

291
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,430
select those who are the

292
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:23,300
recipients of his report of

293
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,230
his report

294
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,240
this because because again you wanted to

295
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,090
try to allow him software

296
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,150
to send your report

297
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:41,120
to the  person who he believes more capable

298
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,330
of handling it because a wikileaks

299
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,640
all the material came au  in the only

300
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,340
organization and there was no way to

301
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,740
know if what was the outcome who saw the

302
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,500
material and how he managed it instead here we

303
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,080
already want to allow him on the

304
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,380
web to select the one that is the

305
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:07,910
most useful group to receive  obviously

306
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,400
reporting

307
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,220
on these this simple

308
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,190
configuration model where there is an

309
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,810
administrator rieti are the recipients

310
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,330
lends itself to being able to launch various types of initiatives

311
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,660


312
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,150
you could show the slightly more

313
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:36,220
peculiar ones to see how this

314
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,460
configurability that we have foreseen

315
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,620
is then applied in reality  for example

316
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,900
there have been very simple

317
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,810
initiatives such as Italian initiatives such as pd

318
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,689
hicks where some

319
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,720
pretty smart investigative journalists have set up a

320
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,660
node to manage reports of acts

321
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,900
via investigative journalism for various

322
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,760
areas such as the

323
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,080
food sector and

324
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,510
they have configured a  simple node

325
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:24,710
where they created their own a simple

326
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,200
receiver intended to receive all the

327
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,900
material  that is received

328
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,400
is this one of the simplest cases of

329
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,460
globaleaks installation paradoxically

330
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:44,980
instead there are very diversified cases

331
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,650
this is a very simple case because

332
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,870
they have configured a single receiver

333
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,710
destined to receive all the material

334
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,280
marked hard in the meantime it

335
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,839
shows a much more articulated scenarios

336
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,189
were those for example of

337
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:21,740
public an organize in the Netherlands an

338
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,270
organization has created a special

339
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,660
foundation in the public foundation

340
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,480
deciding to create a node in which the

341
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,440
recipients are all the Dutch media

342
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,340
you can also open it for a while that

343
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,220
loads all the myths and  Dutch after the

344
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,580
whistle blower where he is a blogger

345
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,129
browsing the whistle blowing site he

346
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:52,970
can select which specific media to

347
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,370
which specific media to send his

348
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:59,210
report because I wanted to show you

349
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,350
this directly because this

350
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,840
software with these simple

351
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,679
external characteristics

352
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:08,750
has probably given space to  a very

353
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,049
interesting case of a day

354
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,240
rather innovative lism because you can

355
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,580
see that the whistle blowers

356
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,549
available the possibility to report

357
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:22,549
select which media

358
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:25,070
the material will mark and these media I

359
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,200
don't know do not even have the same

360
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,500
political color and despite this they have

361
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,840
signed an agreement which requires that

362
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,210
if two  paradoxically, media of two

363
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,759
of different political colors receive the

364
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,379
material are forced by an agreement to

365
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:47,090
collaborate your report

366
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,350
also they have established a way of doing

367
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,360
good journalism and therefore do not give results

368
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,509
to simple reports to simple news

369
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:01,809
they have signed an agreement and where

370
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,000
they have regulated how to manage the

371
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,539
material  received something that

372
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:11,360
was not there in wikileaks for example in this case

373
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,320
they decided that a report

374
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,200
cannot turn into a news before a

375
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,350
period of 15 days so that

376
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,539
a good investigation can be followed up

377
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,879
so not a simple

378
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:31,600
news but has  a

379
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,080
story of formation is therefore never

380
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,880
published  do automatic it is made

381
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,500
available that it has selected there are

382
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,600
two possible features there are two

383
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,760
possible features or you configure the node

384
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,440
to be selectable and therefore you

385
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,730
can

386
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,860
choose it or it is fixed and not to

387
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,880
choose it depends on the organization

388
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,529
how it is structured

389
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:20,840
of an editorial office in which there is a

390
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,929
working group that has three separate parts inside

391
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:26,139
and these parts forcibly want to

392
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:28,909
work together then it

393
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:31,820
may be the case in which they are all

394
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,639
not selectable

395
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:37,279
but in all cases in which globalism

396
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,260
used to  moment there is the

397
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,760
discretion on the part of the whist

398
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,340
blogger to choose who is his

399
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,080
interlocutor contributors

400
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:16,070
yes of course every look I would say no but it

401
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,690
cannot be held by the software what

402
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,070
we can do to the maximum as

403
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:26,260
software is in but for a journalist they

404
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:37,130
wait for what to say  a promptly if one

405
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,140
every journalist must in any case review

406
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,570
what he receives and this is part of

407
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,740
his journalis practice  tica

408
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,190
if then the next boffo case was

409
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,710
received not with the false dossier in the

410
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,100
newspaper but with the right newspaper this is

411
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,350
an abuse of the journalistic position

412
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,120
which was then sanctioned at least

413
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,210
as regards the specific case of

414
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,120
boffo sallusti so abuses can

415
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,580
excuse me can  to exist I do not depend on

416
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,020
technology what we try to

417
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,900
do is always on whether we have to give

418
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,290
support to explain that some criteria are

419
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,000
ceased and the necessary tour policies

420
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,800
if instead someone uses

421
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,360
software senses we no longer know it and

422
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,880
they adopt it even badly there we cannot

423
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,570
anyway  preventing this abuse is another

424
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,530
way not to solve but

425
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,540
partially mitigate the entry of

426
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,900
garbage-type information such as what

427
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,720
is what we say that is

428
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,390
used in the more traditional world

429
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,620
of whistleblowing which is not

430
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,330
directly linked to journalism but

431
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,460
often linked to the compliance of the

432
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,370
contrast to corruption these things here

433
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:48,920
where they are defined in a much

434
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,600
more pr  apart from

435
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,300
the type of information on which you

436
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,400
want

437
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,020
I say that you can take charge

438
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,060
which can be environmental abuse or

439
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,750
corruption depending on the category to

440
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,870
which you are making the

441
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,730
report ask the whistleblower for a quantity of

442
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,040
information of high quality and

443
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,500
inadequate quantity which means  that if

444
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,060
I ask you about all the people

445
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,710
involved their data

446
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,800
tell me when the fact happened

447
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,160
tell me what is the economic damage that

448
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,240
was done ask you how I can

449
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,680
verify what you said

450
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,230
then maybe unroll twenty or thirty

451
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,130
questions

452
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,140
so not a  free form write

453
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,600
what you think that leads you to make a

454
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,310
more detailed and more

455
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,470
qualified report then raise the quality

456
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,210
of the information it is obvious that if I

457
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,550
also optionally ask you many in

458
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,250
many requests many questions and to

459
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,990
answer me only 3 and  then they write me a

460
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,970
long story in the description but without the

461
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,740
term also indicated how I

462
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,390
could verify the veracity of

463
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,610
this thing is an indicator of low

464
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,470
reliability of the report

465
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,780
here this these are things that in the

466
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,170
work that will be done later

467
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,850
will be more and more embedded within

468
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,800
the software even with

469
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,140
default questions to facilitate this type

470
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,790
of information quality filter and

471
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,350
precisely and  implemented an

472
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,760
exchange function possibility of exchanging

473
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,200
information

474
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,360
there is a system in

475
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,950
messaging quotes no between the whistle blower and the

476
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,200
receiver with in the middle however this layer

477
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,590
of anonymity that serves your business

478
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,960
cicada facilitate this type of

479
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,780
operation here so

480
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,780
check the  information that is not a thing

481
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,580
it is not a unilateral channel but it is a

482
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,770
channel that, if desired, a bilateral communication can be established

483
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,190


484
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,110
specific questions to the taste blogger who perhaps

485
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,110
lives a very contextual situation

486
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,390
wants to explain himself better but

487
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,340
the journalist or the person

488
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,720
who receives cannot explain himself  he can ask him questions always

489
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,710
protecting him

490
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,750
always Fri  derive it anonymously and verify that

491
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,130
these people people are not

492
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,470
invented the stuff but have other data they

493
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,360
can circumscribe the issue

494
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,340
so from the vote we like to say that it is not

495
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,710
like another boss another anonymous box

496
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,510
in which he puts the data is hard nishi but

497
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,950
when you do its mission

498
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,779
start your business augusta blauer

499
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:18,669
which will be completed only when it was

500
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:23,140
the data will become news in practice

501
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,830
this

502
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,430
at the discretion of the node of the

503
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,460
node sector that chooses who are the people who

504
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,990
should be part of the network reveals

505
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,600
however let's say so  this is clear

506
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,570
globaleaks a free and open

507
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,060
source software that anyone can download

508
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,400
install that is in the sense it is not something

509
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,350
that we control in a global

510
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,820
ict and then we decide an irpi yes

511
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,440
public snow etcetera etcetera

512
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,870
anyone can do his own way of leaking of

513
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,050
course  if, however, he asks us for support

514
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,870
in the installation and troubleshooting

515
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,520
of the installation, etc., etc.

516
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,400
in the customization, he does  we have

517
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,670
a skimming that is that I know

518
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,860
how to work as we are working with transparency

519
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,770
international it is clear to us that it is

520
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,630
good and right

521
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,070
and now we have started a

522
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,840
collaboration with amnesty

523
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,610
international also on these we say

524
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:31,600
that the doubts about a cube bit are few if

525
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,860
instead  the p2 night arrives which is

526
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,690
completely unknown to us maybe

527
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:41,020
we do an analysis we try to understand

528
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,580
who they are we try to understand if those

529
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,770
who are for their purposes of linking are

530
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,650
the purposes that we say we marry

531
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,160
or

532
00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:56,499
we do not know and they have not even

533
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:58,419
contacted us  we only got caught by

534
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:02,229
google alert and they started

535
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:04,869
an initiative that saw the

536
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:06,279
smiles deshaun plugin then asked for

537
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:09,940
information on let's say secret activity

538
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,119
with fiduciary activity and based on the

539
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,190
banking secrecy of the isle of man is a

540
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,809
tax haven but who the [ __ ] I am

541
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:21,969
these and what they do to us with this

542
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:24,249
information not only do we not

543
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:26,379
know but it is not even publicly

544
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:27,909
no  to in the sense they say we

545
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:29,829
prefer to keep our animated and

546
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:31,269
not say who it is because a ska activity it

547
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:33,369
is obvious that behind an initiative

548
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:36,309
such as mais leaks which thus seems an

549
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:38,109
absolutely beautiful thing and maybe they are

550
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:40,299
also very well motivated people but who

551
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:40,929


552
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:43,239
you know you don't know who they are they tell you you were

553
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:45,789
sending the secret information on

554
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,859
the banking system of the isle of man

555
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:49,869
that is, it can be incredible incredible gear,

556
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:52,839
I could be the anonymous

557
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,909
who started that initiative, get

558
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:56,589
my information and then go and do some

559
00:27:56,589 --> 00:27:58,809
nice ones and  blackmails what the

560
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:01,539
bank account or the

561
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:02,769
offshore company has

562
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:04,839
so there is a whole sensitivity

563
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,749
around depending on how you do things

564
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:08,769
publicly, that is, how your initiative proposes,

565
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:10,749
how you expose it and how it

566
00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:12,819
works this is a  example on which there

567
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:17,219
may be legitimate doubts, but then it

568
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,489
is right that we do

569
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:22,470
these doubts like anyone else, that

570
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,539
is, it is only the initiatives that we have

571
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,940
supported  must necessarily be considered

572
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,369
right

573
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:32,009
ask yourself your questions give you your

574
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:35,659
answers independently in fact

575
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:37,799
relaunch with the creations of the boys

576
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,590
here one thing in my opinion develop

577
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,349
open source software which in any case always

578
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:46,529
last but often presented

579
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:48,960
open source projects children and technical point of

580
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,909
view  however, who then promote them

581
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:52,950
because they use it so the

582
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,989
most interesting part then perhaps also find

583
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:57,210
the way to make this project be

584
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,820
adopted by media of a certain

585
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,950
importance because the three-year project

586
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,159
and the brutal tear was very slow and

587
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:06,419
now I  on the other hand, it seems that you can

588
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:07,979
have some collaboration started to

589
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:12,840
be able to move some of us

590
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,149
who spend a part of their time

591
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:18,059
if not all the time they give, let's say

592
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,789
of the association in following the new

593
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:22,889
prospects, that is, in those who are the

594
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:26,669
new we help them follow them and  let's go

595
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:29,519
and see them pamper them a bit to

596
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,109
make sure that initiatives are born

597
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:32,820
at least the most important ones that is if

598
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,460
amnesty tells us come to bangladesh

599
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,609
we take the plane that is because

600
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:49,180
amnesty many African countries on

601
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,710
investigative journalism issues therefore

602
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,100
in short, however, limit a different one on the

603
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,570
theme that sat v.to we have

604
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,060
now obtained a usable product from  a

605
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,170
non-technical band with an extreme effort

606
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:07,270
because what I had learned with the

607
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,860
Italian community

608
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,840
unfortunately in source is perhaps to create the

609
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,760
interesting technology that is cool technology

610
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,940
but then that cannot be stylized

611
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,120
by the end user because it really lacks

612
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,200
the aspect of the experience of the  product

613
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,720
management and the constant of software

614
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,760
localization in multiple languages

615
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,030
the fact that the software is stable in

616
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,140
even in a few conditions such as we

617
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,970
are giving only on ubuntu far

618
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,430
lawn tennis to bring stability and

619
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,910
nevertheless also study live to the

620
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,320
types of use that we  they are the

621
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,420
proper documentation and the hardest part if

622
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,610
you want for folks like us

623
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,560
who are anyway  of programmers is

624
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,710
this here is just the part of

625
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,320
innovation that I feel we have done and

626
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,970
that you clearly notice that maybe even

627
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,680
thunderbird enigm ale for how much it is

628
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,150
implementing cryptography in

629
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,590
public in the most instinctive way

630
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:00,130
possible has caused that people who do

631
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,260
not want to puzzle because they lack

632
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,990
does an asymmetric cryptography work

633
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,480
do not use it would have tried where

634
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,710
possible to make some considerations

635
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,860
security 106 a security issues

636
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,650
this risk these types of assumptions

637
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,630
we can make them for you

638
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,580
where we can make them we take away a

639
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,290
choice from you so as to simplify the process

640
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,600
where we cannot  making them choose the

641
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,370
administrator node that the person

642
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,890
closest to the context of use

643
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,290
then also bring a

644
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,590
high security level to a usable level it

645
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,890
was really the difficult cig ment and

646
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,710
with which I feel that

647
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,750
something new in fact cost a lot of time

648
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,440
because doing wordpress with report is spam

649
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,660
was easy  mind feasible in a month but

650
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,370
what we got but the level of

651
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,020
security we can now give there is

652
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,220
also a

653
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,840
particularly

654
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,789
nice encryption mechanism that manages to ensure that every

655
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:57,640
landed file that agitates you that travels

656
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,770
from put the channel and thor is then encrypted

657
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,179
with the public key of the recipient

658
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:04,270
without ever touching the file system in

659
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,760
clear text despite the fact that it can be

660
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,340
even 10 giga files because there is a mechanism

661
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,590
that will now explain john or rather he will

662
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,830
explain it after contorto web 15 august there

663
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,059
is precisely the most difficult part of

664
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,549
our  project produced

665
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:51,139
but a question the discussions

666
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:56,359
answered when a very simple question

667
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:58,309
me from the journalist that is as a whistle

668
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,049
blower I make a submission

669
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:12,440
anonymously how you contact me you do not

670
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,440
contact you but we tell the whistleblower

671
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,980
how to return to your report and

672
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,350
see any comments you

673
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,690
have  so i don't have a mechanism there

674
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,789
isn't a push mechanism of the response

675
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:28,159
but i have to ric  order me to come back

676
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,409
because if I keep my news on a

677
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:33,889
ticket

678
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:37,340
yes yes exact this this figure between you will

679
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,710
mark with to address book on your

680
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,980
mobile your mission lasts 180 of

681
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,739
time because one of the security events

682
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:48,379
also the from tri nation policy every

683
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:50,840
submissions cancel in which to  days

684
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,119
or then it extended over duration, however,

685
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:55,190
ideally nothing well preserved in the long

686
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,409
term because if it is managed it might as

687
00:33:57,409 --> 00:33:58,999
well be that any type

688
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:00,919
of trace that has been deducted

689
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:02,450
between taste and bloggers and journalists or

690
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,609
recipients of the ticket needs a place to

691
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,879
return to the  his submission exchange

692
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:12,260
comments land new files so if

693
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,489
there is this

694
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:17,319
web support and maybe I do it later

695
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:24,580
then it can be

696
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,168
exact it is precisely the speech

697
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:34,300
that instead sutor tweb

698
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,040
comes to me I think that if I

699
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,659
wanted to do an anonymous mission auction

700
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,179
that is, whoever made a bull did not think about

701
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,560
the todd webb mechanism precisely for a

702
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,000
safety issue because whoever

703
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,850
manages the torture node sees the  my ep

704
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,790
my traffic then I can have a thousand vpn

705
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:53,119
but it is honestly if I had to do

706
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,800
the mister blog and I would stay on a tour

707
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,030
because my isp does not have to know where

708
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,560
I am going that is I would like that before

709
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,090
the sp there was already the traffic

710
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,910
around and me  one thinks that this

711
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,580
simplification can cause

712
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,920
problems for those who want to run such a

713
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,250
service only to aggregate

714
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,960
information, however, I repeat globaleaks

715
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,710
is not a software with a

716
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,680
precooked configuration that enables any node to

717
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,750
globalize to be published through between

718
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,020
two but globaleaks is a

719
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,180
configurable framework  depending on the type of

720
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,760
initiative that I have to start and the

721
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,600
risk scenario because you can also

722
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,060
have a super-secure software made

723
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,600
accessible only with

724
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,300
a strong encryption back with an autograph but it

725
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,619
will not be used and whoever needs to

726
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:54,140
start an initiative will do so with a

727
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,130
wordpress without https and whatnot or

728
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,830
whatever we say is up to him just to

729
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,570
try to evaluate  what their

730
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,090
risks that its risk of default

731
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,210
globaleaks is not exposed via the wrong

732
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,330
web so when it is installed and

733
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,400
can only be accessed via the ben

734
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,700
service then the admin can choose to

735
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,650
publish it also via the wrong web

736
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,080
it displays a huge  warning

737
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,650
saying attention

738
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,380
the dead unicorns could start

739
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,850
raining from the sky

740
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,280
if you click yes okay I want to continue at

741
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,250
that point is activated for or in any case

742
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,290
when the whistleblower visits a site and

743
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,550
not the status

744
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,410
a node globaleaks and is visiting it

745
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,300
not by finding it is

746
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,780
displayed  a warning message here

747
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,710
attention is not using

748
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,430
thor we advise you to download it from here

749
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,070
and when he goes to make a

750
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,700
submission he is told again

751
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,100
attention we are not joking

752
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,190
really you are not anonymous we explain

753
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,470
what it means that it is not anonymous yes

754
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,960
knows that the twisted web node could

755
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,470
intercept the data of its submission

756
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,700
etcetera etcetera

757
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,010
at that point the v  he is asked a question

758
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:16,050
that is insert the sentence that is true

759
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,780
between the following sentences if he answers in the

760
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,510
wrong way he is not allowed to

761
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,550
make a submission if instead he answers

762
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,080
with the right answer at that point

763
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,750
we understand that he has actually

764
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,730
understood what the risks are  and in that case it

765
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,750
can continue and carry out its mission

766
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,650
banquet another thing

767
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,490
tortù web must be considered in two ways on the

768
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,680
one hand it is necessary for globaleaks

769
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,330
I could also expose situations in which

770
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,620
they had not animated but on

771
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,050
confidentiality and in the other case it is

772
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,000
a strategic event for the diffusion

773
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,140
of thor because the inter services store

774
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,650
suffers from a phenomenon born in the

775
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,560
networks for which there are less known and less if they

776
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,530
create a network it tends to become a

777
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,720
monopolist of itself therefore thus

778
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,330
creating the railway network

779
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,160
the distance  and binaries then becomes the

780
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,320
de facto standard to consider telephone

781
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,660
the mechanism with which we speak is the

782
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,630
world standard of internet telephony and

783
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,600
the global network and  the first leeden

784
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,790
service is not a global network network

785
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,310
used by a strong ignorance this

786
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,680
strong minority knows they have a great

787
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,930
need for security to get to

788
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,000
expose their services anonymously

789
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,850
but we have seen that it can be useful for

790
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,500
anyone to expose services in a way

791
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,170
attributable to itself because if you trace a

792
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,630
priori or because it is the only guarantee that

793
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,100
your users can

794
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,570
communicate in a confidential way

795
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,550
but this thing here must be explained must be

796
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,750
explained and if he managed to create an

797
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,820
activity around these iden services and

798
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,980
tortures it becomes necessary therefore why

799
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,720
even people outside thor

800
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,000
can understand that tower is useful is

801
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,120
simple and can act to spread

802
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,800
your browser bundle which then makes you

803
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,020
sell part of the top 20 account that the

804
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,480
bander overhead and torture where it says

805
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,240
used bowser bundle the better

806
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,590
the earthquake te percent of the purpose dr

807
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,020
tweb ensure that content that does not

808
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,370
lend itself to add that reaches the world

809
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,290
faces excellent plant so be it p

810
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,660
more sure it will be faster and it is better

811
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:27,250
so do it sorry I wanted to answer

812
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,850
what you said about one thing and we

813
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,800
often talk from a computer point of view

814
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,130
barrack ok but

815
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,840
people think differently just

816
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,400
what does it mean that we do a

817
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,350
million mind whacks about

818
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,860
safety so let's say how do you like headlights back to

819
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,630
me the answer they have to go

820
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,000
pole in pushing thing like that i

821
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,310
judge i was the protagonist in

822
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,920
spite of myself in a winston boing speech

823
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,430
and in the end the reporter tells you

824
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:01,690
something one  let's see each other because it is a

825
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,670
mentality that they have that with such a

826
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,010
tool they have to change

827
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,790
ok absolutely

828
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,520
two thousand it seems mental for example you have to

829
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,710
contact me but not with the email you have to

830
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,270
use encrypted systems etc. but I

831
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,910
assure you that in the end if it is something that

832
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,940
really burns them  they say where but

833
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,770
i send you a ticket let's

834
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,440
meet in kathmandu in the square in front of a coffee

835
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,680
but they want to see you as if  to

836
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,930
give some guarantees on the news brawl,

837
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,840
however, it is a big problem of

838
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,460
mentality that even the journalists must change

839
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,170
because otherwise we will

840
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,480
make 2000 it seems, however, then we

841
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,920
find ourselves in a situation like this,

842
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,580
then you had sent things away tor one

843
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,500
see the comments and  then who says ok where

844
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:59,910
we meet and the stage falls for you until

845
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,200
now we have not said what the

846
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,540
web cake is someone knew but the

847
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,910
others think now they do not think

848
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,400
the transport

849
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:36,390
is okay anyway

850
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,910
thor is a software that allows through

851
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,800
a technology  call tori den

852
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,310
services to make anonymous servers that

853
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:48,010
are in the one called deep web

854
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,840
to access these servers it is

855
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,750
however necessary to install the tower itself

856
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,240
and this may not be easy for

857
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,540
all users also thorne not

858
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:07,050
thor server names are not public

859
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,610
indexed by  for example to

860
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,730
search engines for which if a user wants to

861
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,700
reach a resource that is in the deep

862
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,250
web he must know it regardless

863
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:23,140
in 2008 aa  ron swarz thinking about this

864
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,360
problem since he strongly believed in

865
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,240
free information, he thought about how to

866
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,560
solve the problem and thought about

867
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,970
creating a proxy and then

868
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,720
creating a software that allows you to provide

869
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,140
a web server if you are requested

870
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,840
to  requested

871
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,690
contents that are in the art this

872
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:52,360
retrieves them and provides them to the user and

873
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,600
then he thought of starting

874
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,110
a node with this software assuming if he the

875
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,760
responsibility of following contents that

876
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,520
in fact are the alarm for this

877
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,850
was initially born top web  .org on

878
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,780
which there is a setup of this

879
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,150
hardware software and later we tried to

880
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:16,690
find other volunteers who would run

881
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:19,570
other nodes then distributing among

882
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,280
them the responsibility of running

883
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,660
a service of this type

884
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:27,580
this is the reason why we

885
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,760
wrote about it  somewhere on the wiki there are

886
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,270
other nodes like tortue dot org chat

887
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:37,030
web dot fia in finland there is a

888
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:39,580
tu point and there are other t  All followed by

889
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:44,910
different types of volunteers we

890
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,400
collaborated with aaron in writing that he

891
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,700
knows software and we then included it in

892
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,230
globaleaks to achieve the same

893
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,960
goal, that is to ensure that it is

894
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,230
a whistle blowing initiative born

895
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:02,710
by anonymous people that can be reached

896
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:06,190
by users who  they do not have in their three

897
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,650
models therefore their scenario the risk the

898
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:12,780
need to be anonymous

899
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,840
themselves so in global if we have allowed

900
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,970
different scenarios to be configured

901
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,650
the risk that the application

902
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,320
is reachable only through the toro network

903
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,930
or even through the tweb editor

904
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:28,990
what is the advantage of publishing a

905
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:30,460
node through reeling because

906
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:34,570
the user can find the initiative

907
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:37,120
directly indexed on and I would

908
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,120
add that while we say once upon a time

909
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,700
web had to be this software

910
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,060
that one runs to expose

911
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:50,910
the whole network and darknet thor  with

912
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,160
the use of wrong web for globaleaks

913
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,770
then one puts on a knot of wrong

914
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,350
web we are interested in neces  sary expose

915
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,970
the entire darknet thor maybe he

916
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,950
is only interested in exposing his

917
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,930
node globaleaks in this case it is

918
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:07,260
possible to configure torto web to

919
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,970
forward traffic only to a

920
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:12,910
specific idem service so one can

921
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,840
have a web node managed by himself on a tortoise node

922
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,710
therefore still trusted it is  however, do

923
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:23,440
not incur all the

924
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,099
risks derived from allowing anyone

925
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,040
to access any good service

926
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,240
in the darknet thor

927
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,190
look

928
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,819
no it's better

929
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:07,650
so it also works in a certain sense

930
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:12,210
from a discovery system that is who

931
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,520
allows you to discover the address of the

932
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,780
point everyone starting from a domain

933
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,640
sorry one thing a little less technological

934
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,570
no no active bulls are not many

935
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:29,280
not intended I do not speak globally

936
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,160
I say let's take a city a country one

937
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,010
do not think that the very fact of

938
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:38,240
having active service attracts the  attention

939
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,450
but it still depends on there are

940
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:49,560
more than 45 million users every day thor understood

941
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,210
however in the world let's say a city

942
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,400
how many there are in venice

943
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,570
here at this moment you pull that is this

944
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:02,840
potentially creates some

945
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,280
potential elements probably to be

946
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,030
controlled

947
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:10,440
this is why the concept is if aitor

948
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,300
there is probably something to hide

949
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,370
this type of prejudice used

950
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,650
by the productions this gesture given how much

951
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,350
I am abused  even with him bull or happens

952
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,400
to linux journal

953
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,530
then maybe you are a techno terrorist

954
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:25,830
so let's say that I hope it becomes

955
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:27,300
clear in the intelligence of the next few

956
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,720
years that it is a bit of an atypical procedure

957
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,880
Italy has some analyzes I did

958
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,370
was the second country for the  '' use of

959
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:39,840
thor in the sense of second country if we

960
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,940
take the number of connected users that

961
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,580
re official statistics given to tor

962
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:48,360
divided by percentage by per million

963
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,240
so many connected therefore having the first

964
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,290
place uf6 which has many more citizens

965
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:58,370
connected and less relevant than

966
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:01,110
having them  in italy where the percentage

967
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,750
of use then in practice the highest

968
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,160
we were second only to saud saud  eng

969
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,010
they did those tests

970
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,550
when the motivation that we had

971
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,290
asked ourselves why there were

972
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:16,180
spiders and one of the hypotheses

973
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,970
we will make

974
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:45,620
you said there is a question

975
00:48:48,230 --> 00:49:06,720
it is returning to the speech tortù returning

976
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,960
to the speech tortù web globaleaks fortwo

977
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,079
and it is  basically an entry point

978
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:15,510
for the tor network

979
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:18,180
this means that if I do an

980
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,799
installation of global leaks on my

981
00:49:19,799 --> 00:49:23,069
node where uniten service runs it would turn me

982
00:49:23,069 --> 00:49:25,319
in a tower configured in day service below

983
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:27,480
I will have the right global ict framework

984
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,549
let's say that when globaleaks stalls

985
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,980
to the ground and services dedicated

986
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,380
and then the option that you do not accept

987
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,670
connection that arrive at the wrong web

988
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,440
because when you arrive scort web

989
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,900
an eder is put in the connection with

990
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,809
hicks torture be true and you by default and

991
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:45,510
do not accept that it can cause

992
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:48,000
disability  accept one can communicate

993
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,010
with you ok I wanted to understand precisely this

994
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,079
thing if how the discourse

995
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,390
of inhibiting access was managed through the

996
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,640
entry point tram nodes  ite the ssis in this

997
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,290
mechanism because luck had

998
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,940
however put a given application and a

999
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,180
web http connection since in

1000
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,900
practice strictly web not also other

1001
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,010
types of connections that instead may

1002
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:11,579
exist in the silver network and and this

1003
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,079
is the application available here if

1004
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:14,970
too many that  he wanted to succeed at all things

1005
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,760
69 but did not check leather torture and

1006
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,619
therefore accepted that the user arrived

1007
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:24,319
given art lab also constructions

1008
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:30,269
default node 2

1009
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,649


1010
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:08,010
no node tweb node globaleaks node

1011
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,920
globaleaks node well if you don't have a

1012
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,950
data encryption mechanism on the disk that

1013
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:17,880
what compromises is the database part with

1014
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,400
application data inside the

1015
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,100
default files would be encrypted for the

1016
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,350
recipients as long as the recipients

1017
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,990
have put their public key a

1018
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:30,990
red warning tool as a house

1019
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:33,390
careful this way is not recommended

1020
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,700
because a recipient has not configured

1021
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,990
I was able to make it his key to

1022
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,550
make the

1023
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:40,950
journalist responsible for putting it in spite of it

1024
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:43,530
one could also ignore it and say the

1025
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:46,260
data is so the nice thing about the tower

1026
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,550
that in any case hides the

1027
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:50,040
geographical allocation of the server of consequences you

1028
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,400
have exposed the node via thor all to

1029
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,200
reach through torture however

1030
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,300
where geographically st this serves with

1031
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,090
which p is connected to the internet not  it

1032
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:02,190
is not is not known so the only possibility

1033
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,440
of registration is an attack through the

1034
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,380
globaleaks software and luckily

1035
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,630
we have had three

1036
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,370
different tentation testers reviewed by three different tentation testers who have

1037
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,830
carried out both architectural and code analyzes and

1038
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:17,420
on the web side that the ato  python

1039
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,980
therefore we could keep reasoning

1040
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,340
safe that we are not exposed attacks from

1041
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,980
remote place of zero day on twisted that

1042
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:29,210
may also be possible

1043
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,590
certain

1044
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,880
to build that a license plate and disabled

1045
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,610
there was still captured and it will be

1046
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:42,530
beautiful

1047
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:44,520
christ

1048
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,110
in reality what

1049
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:48,480
claudio described  is the current state of the software

1050
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,350
for implementation reasons currently

1051
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:56,730
the server was only encrypting the fi  with

1052
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:01,590
the silver cameras and not the answers given

1053
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:04,740
applications the forum answers that

1054
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:07,530
he was given only afterwards but it is in the road

1055
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:10,860
map of the next 18 months to implement

1056
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,290
the entirely client side encryption

1057
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,270
in this case it will no longer be possible to

1058
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:29,430
read even these data during

1059
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:32,030
the  'installation of global hicks the setup

1060
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,930
the configuration assistance tools

1061
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:36,680
provide help

1062
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,550
to the user for the creation of a

1063
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,160
clean system redo and to avoid side

1064
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,320
there is in the tax or things of this type for

1065
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,000
which all the traffic independently

1066
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,310
passes through thor  as if it were thales for

1067
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:50,940
example or not for now then

1068
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,760
back end side all eventual requests

1069
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,280
that the back goes to the internet

1070
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,760
are all worried about the territory

1071
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,700
you asked if

1072
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:07,559
we give suggestions we start with the

1073
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:10,029
product I love so that I have palix

1074
00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:18,000
that of  simplify the adoption therefore

1075
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:30,390
no no the left reflection is yes yes no

1076
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,400
oh well but the global leaks

1077
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,680
editors application that terrified but a  application level

1078
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,740


1079
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:55,040
in a brutal way

1080
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,870
but if they have broken through the car by

1081
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,670
now that they have broken through it is not

1082
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,420
what you can do you are not the

1083
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,270
disqualification could be among the

1084
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:09,009
when we will contain with totti
