1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
the first ambiter is the east of this year and

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,150
therefore dear tonight

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,620
sees the participation of luca moroni

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,280
who is an old friend of the summer card

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,980
however then for some years he has

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,770
also participated in already proposed talks in the

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,130
past and with regards

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,400
also to some of  these projects

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,230
in particular one that has had

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,180
an evolution which then we will talk about

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,539
tonight and

12
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,969
and therefore basically tonight

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,270
we will talk in the cyber security angels project

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,829


15
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,950
so thanks luca for participating

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,950
in dissipating this year

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,070
's edition of ann summers is a

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,379
cedar directly the word  you know cai

19
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,460
half an hour for the presentation

20
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,750
before all the screens I can't

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,579
take a break with beer like the fans

22
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:03,510
and so I'm here from home so let's say

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,880
thank you for hosting me

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,090
and also give me the space to present

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,670
this let's say this project  which

26
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,490
then somehow I wanted to show you

27
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,220
in short that it already has

28
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,700
incubation in 2018 when I had done

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,290
the talk and let's say

30
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,570
invited by seba  stay where I presented

31
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,299
the white paper the one on the h factor

32
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,189
and at the time I made it a c

33
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:37,770
circulated a bit to something still

34
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,119
hybrid that is, there was talk of security angel

35
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,119
alliance certainly 2018 time has

36
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,399
passed but in short the idea was always

37
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,009
this  I'm messing up

38
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:54,210
the discussion, in short, of the fact that therefore

39
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,460
keep in mind that the project is shared

40
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,570
with antonio that the CEO of Breton

41
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,950
with whom we

42
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,260
started this initiative that is, until it was a bit of

43
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,410
something so incubation is my idea

44
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,360
but then with him we shared the

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,030
project and therefore we are therefore the

46
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,390
speech was the fact that it is a memory

47
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,730
one day while drinking coffee it turned out

48
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,920
that

49
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,320
everyone teams up therefore the bad guys team up

50
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,840
I remember that an article had come out

51
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,600
that the different gangs let's say

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,209
attackers if they were aggregates that

53
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:35,300
sell supplements  they are all aggregated

54
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,390
the only guns that are not bound

55
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,520
are the companies themselves so this is

56
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,260
a bit of an idea and therefore in some

57
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,070
m  odo let's say outside is a world a good

58
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,620
goal style and therefore the perspective is to

59
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,830
try to network between

60
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,760
different frani in the various different companies

61
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,770
a bit here they are the photo of antonio and

62
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,230
what you see is the extract from

63
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,470
the sail no because  in any case,

64
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,470
the real scenario is

65
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,750
also the real reason that when

66
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,360
an accident substantially occurs, the

67
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,209
manager is alone, i.e. he certainly does not

68
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:17,090
have to account to all

69
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,100
internal users to restore the

70
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,110
systems and all who ask him for

71
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,170
information, vendors and  integrators

72
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,600
who see a great opportunity to

73
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,450
place peers of security solutions

74
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,330
and so let's say if he's really alone

75
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,750
and is to defend he has to allocate a bit

76
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,610
so the idea is that let's say to

77
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,450
share this path with others too

78
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,989
and let

79
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,730
's say suffering

80
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,410
beyond  beyond all there are

81
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,019
two reasons so these are the two the two the two

82
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,959
main points who is the one you see

83
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,829
there is collected is a point of 27001

84
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:01,640
you know  grandi 7100 deals with

85
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,250
computer security issues one of those of the

86
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,380
principals that is they say the things that must

87
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,870
be done is to create

88
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,049
connection groups anyway let's say to

89
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:14,060
exchange information therefore csa

90
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,399
was also born for this with this

91
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,310
objective the second objective is also

92
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,108
that  will try to make a minimum of

93
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:24,020
strong common compared to the big vendors

94
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,900
which, in any case, substantially large

95
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,169
vendors let's say have total power

96
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,330
compared to companies, not above all

97
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,310
the big ones because clearly

98
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,570
if tomorrow the situations change, even

99
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,120
in economic terms, the customer

100
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,710
cannot go back  so

101
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,620
the kin problem is one of the

102
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,000
aspects that you want to go

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,310
antigua let's say the

104
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,639
objectives of the network are summarized no so

105
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,350
exchanging information is not that it is a

106
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,690
solution it is only those

107
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,860
responsible for the information systems of the

108
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,680
other company runs when you have

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,810
taken in crypt rock era and helps you

110
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,240
restores  ting close to this is not and it

111
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,310
is unthinkable however they are exchanging

112
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,960
information

113
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,470
maybe yes and

114
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,410
integrators and consultants are not allowed because

115
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,180
clearly the past is to

116
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,490
exchange information on incidents

117
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,710
1 and 2 also exchange suggestions

118
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,380
on hobo platforms on solutions

119
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,660
then the first, i.e. in the event of an

120
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,389
accident, it is clear that if you say it and there is,

121
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:37,370
I will also say one day director in the group

122
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,010
maybe then news will come out, in short, that

123
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,919
afterwards it costs a lot of money to

124
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,830
allocate the damage to the image and the other

125
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,690
is that  if you ask for an evaluation I say

126
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,960
about the solution I say inter

127
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,880
authentication on two factors at

128
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,330
least it is hammered for a month by

129
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,639
all the possible suppliers in this world

130
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,449
who want to sell you well so

131
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:04,280
another aspect is also that we say

132
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,469
to carry on looking

133
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:10,819
around also who  composes something is at

134
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:12,110
the Italian level

135
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,379
the government just defined that the import

136
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:18,050
has the national and important perimeter

137
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,650
of s companies  security and in Italy who

138
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,449
have something to say

139
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,759
are very few so anyway if

140
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,159
there are some interesting ideas why

141
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:29,889
not maybe exchanging some

142
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,319
information is still an important part

143
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,910


144
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,610
here is currently let's say the first

145
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,800
phase is to join the group on

146
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,030
linkedin

147
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,620
the group  linkedin is a long and a

148
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,810
closed group so you are invited

149
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,760
because

150
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,710
you participate in a company and

151
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,780
today there are about 280, let's say interested anyway,

152
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,160
don't realize that it is like

153
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,920
entering a room and looking

154
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,500
around and feeling a little how the air is blowing,

155
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,960
however  it's just a manifestation in

156
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,690
some way of interest and this

157
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,090
here are a few evaluations let's say

158
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,400
from people because everything starts

159
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,520
in a very streamlined way and we also try

160
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,080
to have people who get

161
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,810
busy and therefore

162
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,590
o on every project there  he is a project manager

163
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,450
of carry forward but these are some

164
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,419
evaluations that have been given that are

165
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:27,820
also present on the sushi

166
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,930
there is a channel of  rivulets on let's say for

167
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,150
the exchange of information until the end of the

168
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,060
year they were on watts then from the

169
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,340
start we moved to Sicily

170
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,930
so that's an open channel they

171
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,250
had to express asks for support

172
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,770
evaluations exposes a problem warns of

173
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,380
a possible accident perhaps asks for an

174
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,480
opinion if others have  had

175
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,100
some reports

176
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,560
so it is an open channel radio london

177
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,730
in short he had to express his and

178
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,240
his commands here I have given you an

179
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,930
example and let's say to make you understand the

180
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,120
concept that they are not put they sell

181
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,860
supplements even a

182
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,500
snobbish but there is the  concept is that if one

183
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,410
expresses a request on such a

184
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,500
solution but also in the open world that is

185
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,050
in the better sense vupen better

186
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,080
commercial type solutions or you have tried

187
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,940
that type of thing it is clear that one among

188
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,980
only to have an opinion not because he necessarily

189
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,930
wants to buy a  platform

190
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,630
and therefore in this case the idea was in

191
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,120
any case not to admit

192
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,360
external de titta anyway

193
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,220
certainly the goal would also

194
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,900
be to explain the accidents, but

195
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,560
actually the problem is a bit like

196
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,620
this, there is a problem because no one

197
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,110
declares an accident even if the others

198
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,600
are colleagues and the risk is quite

199
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,760
big and you know it's nuanced when

200
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,730
an accident happens the leakage of

201
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,950
information also the discruise

202
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,510
etc etc etc then a piece of

203
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,850
machado in the end we have fun no

204
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,400
so you see some the pin

205
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,760
there which is this one you see it's the we say

206
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,390
the gazette we gave each other no and then

207
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,730
we say we have fun in short in the end it's

208
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,920
also not  just one thing one thing

209
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,820
let's say about work whose fundamental concept

210
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,910
is networking so we

211
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,370
started the first ago the first dinner

212
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,300
in treviso where we were about 12 13

213
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,810
people and the last is for example those

214
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,960
you see that let's say the one at the

215
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,630
top right we were  about 35 there are people

216
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,010
from friuli from

217
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,450
emilia anyway they said they were all the

218
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,690
big and important companies on the fauna when

219
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,310
that is, we meet because it is important

220
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,520
for us to network and let's say

221
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,120
talk to each other because it's not just motorcycles it's like

222
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,990
drinking a beer let's say here we know

223
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,120
we chat maybe we have a

224
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,330
briefing and then we eat in short

225
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,370
their last last supper that made me  rubio

226
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,750
is a new la 40a on a verona

227
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,460
let's say let's let's make

228
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,100
content with the aim also that

229
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,590
some tell their experiences not

230
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,150
the angels and tell themselves it's a bit of

231
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,430
this this aspect is certainly

232
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,890
important but basically we try

233
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,570
to give valuable content

234
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,930
without let's say without the slightly

235
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,300
commercial hustlers and therefore what we do we

236
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,300
do with the brains at the beginning of the year to

237
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,280
understand a little what are the topics

238
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,220
that are of interest to everyone so for

239
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,400
example when the top is reported the

240
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,450
ranking in order of preferences for

241
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,630
2020 and 2021  but you see that the most

242
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,000
interesting one the topic was for

243
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,410
example on the governance

244
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,410
and security framework and in fact then you have it  love

245
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,720
we made a

246
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,030
specific one precisely from this point of view

247
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,900
clearly we too were

248
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,670
impacted by copy bernes that the last

249
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,250
event we had done was precisely in

250
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,400
vicenza after we treated everything and

251
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,790
we kind of started over to it

252
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,140
these are the things we did

253
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,690
we  from contents perhaps

254
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,270
also interested in something a little lighter like I don't know

255
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,400
the presentations of apple and his

256
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,470
book we said the silent tragedy the

257
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,260
one on safety for children

258
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,690
rather than the interview with carola

259
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,460
frediani who told us a little

260
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,030
about her vision  della of the headquarters

261
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,850
security in the future these are the

262
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,150
things we do from here to say to

263
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,250
that are already scheduled for the end

264
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,590
of the year so let's give sponsorship to

265
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,230
an event that is now doubtful but

266
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,210
mind you it's fair to say  even

267
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,550
a little the value seems to me yes to

268
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,530
us with the sixty people

269
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,160
of companies about ten are members of csa

270
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,450
so we have a delegation in gubbio

271
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,340
you say  I love that it is certainly important

272
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,800
the others are still topics

273
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,680
that were of interest to everyone the last one is

274
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,960
let's say

275
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,700
deals with the theme of wellness which then is the

276
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,070
thing I wanted to show you because I am

277
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,280
very proud to

278
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,600
show you this which is the

279
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
project we have  published just

280
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,880
today, that is, after months of work, we have

281
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,350
elaborated this on the booklets because

282
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,380
there was an idea in mind, we have

283
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,240
seen, I don't know if any of you have

284
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,410
seen it, he has made some booklets at the unieuro

285
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,920
which, let's say, spoke of the

286
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,170
security of the  cyberbullying and therefore there is

287
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,500
the booklet given to the company's logo

288
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,020


289
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,600
a nice interesting idea to

290
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,700
train people is always a problem and

291
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,100
therefore we had a book written

292
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,920
in a simple way on a PC which is the

293
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,340
main problem here the idea of ​​making it

294
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,740
a necklace and in the one with which to

295
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,830
sell it and therefore to find a

296
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,260
livelihood also from the revenue from the

297
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,300
sale of the book but also the

298
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,850
possibility possibly for this  For those who

299
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,700
are interested in clarifying the book

300
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,040
and giving it to customers and suppliers,

301
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,990
let's say this is an aspect in some

302
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,810
way also training no access to

303
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,820
a start teaches that it is better that you

304
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,100
also explain to suppliers that the

305
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,840
password solar wings 12341 is fine but

306
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,670
too much  object and this for example the

307
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,700
fact of going around itinerants to

308
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,400
explain the issues of security because

309
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,280
if you make the elections people get

310
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,950
pissed and therefore the question is

311
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,320
to change and therefore it is the problem

312
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,320
for everyone at indy terme  and the

313
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,590
executives a listen to safety is one

314
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,110
of the most difficult things in this way

315
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,900
however if you bring up a topic let's say

316
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,540
something that interests fun

317
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,550
perhaps with someone who speaks from outside

318
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,120
fi anyway a little disclosure this

319
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,370
is another project let's say l  he idea

320
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,889
is to make a tight CTF between the

321
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:33,930
companies

322
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,399
because I'm the one who's been following the

323
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,370
security issue for a long time you've been hearing about

324
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,100
himself let's say about Pasqual T's blue team  eam

325
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,589
however basically coming

326
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:46,779
down to earth the companies let's say from the

327
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:48,999
north east they don't even know what

328
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:51,370
networks are but imagine if you change the

329
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,160
colors too so let's say the reality is that the

330
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,529
brutes but today only a bank can afford it

331
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,660
an institution  financial,

332
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,350
however perhaps by making a team chosen from

333
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,019
among the companies, one can think of going

334
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:07,839
to make some ctfs of this project in

335
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,360
progress, a sum that has not yet been real.

336
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,620
another aspect is, for example, the

337
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,290
possibility of consulting, as we were saying,

338
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,660
from the members to the other companies

339
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,350
that is, in the sense that if you ask me to

340
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,209
evaluate something while I'm

341
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,639
eating pasta for lunch,

342
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,579
let's say at dinner, he would say it's one thing,

343
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:30,250
however, if he asks you for a serious evaluation and

344
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,139
I can't give it to you and therefore it is right

345
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,089
that it is recognized

346
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:35,290
therefore there is  it is the possibility of

347
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,620
offering consultancy to the other members of the

348
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,589
group using let's say csa come da

349
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:44,110
through therefore an extension of one's

350
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,610
decorum

351
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,829
oh well here are other starts  tive here

352
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:49,899
are the members to date but they are

353
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:52,120
growing so let's say there are

354
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,180
large companies smaller companies the idea was

355
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,660
born let's say when I

356
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,790
talked about it in 2018 it was more of a

357
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,389
territorial idea however ge is the verb one

358
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:09,160
in the sense that the  the word is

359
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,480
spreading so anyway we have people

360
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,750
starting to be from milan of varese

361
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,290
because it is precisely this speech of that

362
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,480
there are no i sell integrated repair fine it

363
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,870
is the only association in short today

364
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,970
also in italy that has this

365
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,899
characteristic

366
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,089
the requirements are these so how

367
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:31,060
said so let's say worked 15 in via

368
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,570
from the company you must have to leave from home

369
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,660
there is a speech linked to

370
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,550
territoriality for the concert of

371
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,089
working the signing of the code of ethics and the

372
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,550
payment of the fee the fee

373
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,130
take into account the fee I am also in

374
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,120
between  and dinners and then made with a moment

375
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,190
of calculations the problem is that we

376
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,250
did bohemian stuff for two years and

377
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,380
we found ourselves we did the Roman way but at

378
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,690
a certain point s  egna impact everything

379
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,970
because when it came to paying for the dining room it is

380
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,250
clearly one who says oh well mascoli

381
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,260
ate I ate a dish and I

382
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,660
also have to pay for the dining room and therefore it is practically

383
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,910
self

384
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,199
-financing therefore more than a membership fee

385
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,720
it is clearly

386
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,980
invoiced

387
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,799
and  this is what I then that is

388
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,890
given so let's say

389
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,660
to the whole range of content and they

390
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,080
have taken possessions are therefore

391
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,020
people stay because we say something

392
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,990
interesting to say there is the

393
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,750
reserved channel I think it is the most

394
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,669
interesting thing is more  important because

395
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:42,669
let's say the questions come

396
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:45,549
up very often in short, there are those who

397
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:48,160
never answer but instead they give

398
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,110
suggestions that are very useful

399
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,480
that are worth gold because in any case going to

400
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,549
look for the best solution on a

401
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:58,919
certain thing is in any case complex let's say

402
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,730
this is he says  a little bit csa

403
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,570
so if you have something some

404
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:11,260
questions to ask it's a bit but it's an idea

405
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,270
let's say it's an idea that has taken hold

406
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,809
in 2018 it was absolutely evanescent stuff

407
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:20,350


408
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,290
today it is something concrete and

409
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,630
clearly precisely the project

410
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,850
again in times Anton also speaks

411
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,890
indeed much more often because he is much

412
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,030
better than me

413
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,540
let's say as a show man and

414
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,700
therefore we say we are carrying on

415
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,970
in short a

416
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,340
following a  path but I hope it goes

417
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,070
on for a while thank you very

418
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,400
much luca then in the meantime it's

419
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,940
21 and 22 it's still slowly and therefore

420
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,860
minutes for any questions answered

421
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,950
I

422
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,410
invite anyone who might have to

423
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:01,730
ask them via the chat channel yes editor

424
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,310
who always said it in the room

425
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,000
maurizio and in

426
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,790
the meantime I asked the question and so

427
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,100
I wanted to understand a flash of a formal view of

428
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,280
how this association is framed,

429
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,490
yes now we say the association and it is

430
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,730
precisely to avoid techniques that I realize that

431
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,710
in some way I am also the founders

432
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,660
of other associations, including clubs of the

433
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,790
friuli summa pd and other other

434
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,610
associations to avoid unnecessary costs and

435
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,430
therefore create an ad hoc company name

436
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,700
it is currently linked

437
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,730
to the company in short 15 spatially

438
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,190
this is the formula however it is alive it remains

439
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,320
separate then if the thing takes hold we

440
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,960
will probably create an

441
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,530
ad hoc company name to avoid having

442
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,440
costs of management of the profit year in any case

443
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,170
it is currently the turnstile also

444
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:05,370
because we don't have great resources

445
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,310
in the sense that antonio

446
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,130
the breton systems managers i other stuff to

447
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,000
do and 15 we find time to do

448
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,070
these initiatives but it's a

449
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,230
side project it's certainly not life in short

450
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,900
so let's try to be as streamlined as

451
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,670
possible if  work is definitely taking hold,

452
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,400
you know there are also costs to

453
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,950
be incurred, in short, let's say that they

454
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,820
must be done anyway, I'm just saying a

455
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,080
series of things that we have done up to

456
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,050
now, even if they have little, they

457
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,720
still need a minimum, the minimum place,

458
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,570
but no more than 100  euros trivially

459
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,640
because a source of income, let's say,

460
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,960
could be that of the book

461
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,980
if some company

462
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,210
ceased to exist  let's say dissemination and

463
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,150
let's say from an interesting content

464
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,090
with your brand I bought the books and therefore

465
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,540
for us it is contracted

466
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,030
ok I saw and you are present

467
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,640
throughout upper Italy then

468
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,370
a slider is shown the companies where I was staying a

469
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,400
particular one that is materially very

470
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,190
close  not to the point where he

471
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,720
is also doing market dance

472
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,179
this year which is the area

473
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:24,700
that a fairly

474
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,910
large company has seen and in any case on the part it

475
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,190
adheres to a company but in reality it is a

476
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,980
person from the company who is in

477
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,780
some way delegated  so

478
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,610
we wanted to better understand this

479
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,710
internet relationship that once station how

480
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,630
contact takes place and how it then

481
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,850
develops

482
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,190
and then surely it is made by let's say

483
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,650
by a single person i.e. a person there is

484
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,559
a contact person but there are also

485
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:56,020
companies that have more  people who

486
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,990
join the cesc however also the

487
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,950
training we do is certainly

488
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,320
justified now it seems to me that there are

489
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,350
at least six or seven  companies that have two

490
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,980
participants inside the csa because

491
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,790
alright besides coming to eat I say it's

492
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,470
eating maybe well we're adding up

493
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,740
let's not skimp on that thing

494
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,330
since we only have to give in

495
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,360
within the speech here is all the content

496
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,450
is available therefore  let's make

497
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,880
awareness clearly not all

498
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,730
available no because for example I don't know

499
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,730
we did an event with arneg and

500
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,549
let's say that maybe you recognize Padua

501
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:42,870
where he explained all the dynamics of

502
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,830
the fact that he had

503
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,690
certified 7100 he sent the

504
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,870
details somehow with

505
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,210
information a bit confidential and therefore

506
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,610
somehow those wind them were

507
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,730
reserved only for members while we do others they

508
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,130
are all available on

509
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,720
the youtube channel they are all available

510
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,960
and you can see his mark

511
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,730
and then there are no other questions

512
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,659
so it was

513
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,330
especially enough  dear to all we say but

514
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:17,039
apart from that ask to remember the

515
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,779
contacts again last volt  a

516
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:22,390
definitely website then also the

517
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,659
youtube channel people can

518
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:29,080
find this content

519
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,779
and then let's say there is there is the site the site

520
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:34,240
to all the information we have

521
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,360
released them even recently if there is no

522
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,270
me and in any case we say we  and of

523
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,480
reference who is moderator let's say that he

524
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,520
can who can be written to in short but

525
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,220
basically it is if someone

526
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,169
interested just makes the

527
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:52,470
request to join the group

528
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,690
cybersecurity and on linkedin and from there

529
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,330
then all the things start so after

530
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,240
one enters and then never one  he asks who is

531
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,279
interested let's say brescia and

532
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,490
sympathizer or do you want to actually

533
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,779
participate etc etc etc so

534
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,899
that and then the unleashing clearly

535
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:14,110
supplements and I'm sorry I can't

536
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,880
make requests they are not stolen

537
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,710
artistic

538
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,630
well then let's still remember new home
