1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
day 2 we start with the first talk

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,720
of the afternoon and we have here fabio che

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,710
lo z who talks about antennas in a

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,690
general sense but then since yesterday we

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,619
had talks about the hour the hour one

6
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:20,160
will decline this talk especially on

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,689
this type and on this typology  of

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,609
antennas so thanks fabio and attack

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,300
hello everyone what we see today is

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,360
a very, very very fast

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,670


12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,860


13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,390


14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,940


15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,739
excursus on what concerns the antennas in the sense that 20 30 minutes out of a little too few to predict the whole excursus of the antennas so

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,610
we will see something  of general

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,890
[Music]

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,110
the antenna

19
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,850
substantially if I look from

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,410
wikipedia it is a device

21
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,059
that

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,039
we say to a

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,480
bidirectionality in the sense that it can

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,970
receive then it transforms an

25
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,460
electromagnetic signal into a voltage or

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,610
vice versa it can transmit therefore it manages

27
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,979
to transmit a board with a certain

28
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,900
frequency in  electromagnetic wave

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,210
the key thing to understand what is

30
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,689
an electromagnetic wave electromagnetic london

31
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:29,009
if we go to ve  tell

32
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,420
the spectrum

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,850
what we where where our

34
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,890
antennas go from work are in

35
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,530
the initial part where you see radio wave and

36
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,920
where you see micro wave

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,320
ii and where the antennas basically

38
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,550
work in reality

39
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,930
even our eyes from a certain point

40
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,810
of view are antennas

41
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,520
because  they receive that yellow slice that

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,570
you see in the visible link above

43
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,140
this is what the eye sees therefore

44
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,619
reality from a technical point of view

45
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:10,869
light does not exist only electromagnetic waves exist

46
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:13,810
therefore in itself it is

47
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,560
the universe is dark it is not light light is  just

48
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,530
an electromagnetic wave that we

49
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,099
our eye sees and transforms into

50
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,319
colors etc etc but the brain

51
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,769
that does it is not

52
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:32,730
the reality as they say

53
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,640
we will deal with the lower part a

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,849
fundamental thing to understand that each

55
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:42,040
electromagnetic wave has its own length

56
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,860
physics its physical length is given by

57
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,420
fact very fast

58
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,790
the

59
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,680
formula 300 divided by the frequency in mega

60
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,549
300 would be

61
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:59,319
300,000 kilometers per second  or of the

62
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,810
speed of light

63
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,850
which simplifying with the megas i.e. the

64
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,280
million

65
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,049
of the part of the frequency you can

66
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:10,600
remove zeros so to simplify

67
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,100
since most of the frequencies

68
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,620
are expressed in megas you can

69
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,660
simply do 300 divided by the

70
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,190
frequency

71
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,639
this gives the value in meters of the

72
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,590
wavelength

73
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,920
I have given two examples the 145 mega which is

74
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,220
a frequency used by radio amateurs

75
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,069
who give a length of two meters

76
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:34,870
in fact radio amateurs very often express

77
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,299
themselves with the length in meters and not

78
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,639
with the frequency like the 40 meters which

79
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,489
are the  7 mega the twenty meters which are

80
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:46,450
14 mag a and since you

81
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,630
spoke about laurent

82
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,139
the planes one hour is around 870 mega which

83
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,500
corresponds to about 35 cm as you can see the

84
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,400
more a frequency rises and the smaller

85
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,500


86
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,000
the length becomes the smaller the length becomes

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,520
wavelength

88
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,300
and at 10 gigabytes and about 3 centimeters and the more you

89
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,800
go and the more you go in the mm part and

90
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,340
then you go down

91
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,970
this can also be interesting

92
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,440
because when you start  aunt to raise the

93
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,320
frequency 16 giga 27 giga 40 giga 60gb

94
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,100
you can imagine how an obstacle

95
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,690
becomes a problem I do for example the

96
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,110
rain which on a 20m wave is not

97
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,200
significant on a 2mm wave it

98
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,210
starts to be significant I don't know

99
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,010
if you have  noticed but when it rains heavy

100
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,510
heavy heavy many

101
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,270
cell phone radio bridges fall because because

102
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,160
the transports are done on

103
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,290
very high frequencies and the big drops

104
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,310
prevent the passage

105
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,770
another characteristic starting from

106
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,510
the lowest frequencies to the highest ones

107
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,540
is that some up to a certain  frequency

108
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,770
are bounced off a layer that

109
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,750
I cannot explain here otherwise twenty

110
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,200
minutes are no longer enough, however, know that

111
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,020
the sun

112
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,890
creates an area

113
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,950
that is defined as

114
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,870
ionized which allows

115
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,290
these waves to bounce back and forth, it

116
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,400
only works up to a certain

117
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,890
frequency which  this varies according to the

118
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,790
day of the night and the seasons and

119
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,890
also

120
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,950
on the solar cycle for which all

121
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,040
these are the characteristics  and they vary

122
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,720
the maximum bounce

123
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,570
frequency exceeded this frequency from that

124
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,120
moment on all the waves follow

125
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,160
a wave in quotes a

126
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,630
straight path called optical

127
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,820
example if you want to communicate now with

128
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,640
outside Europe or in any case in Europe

129
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,180
you have to use frequencies around below  the

130
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,630
30 megs if you want to communicate here that a

131
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,450
radius of 200 meters you can use

132
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,370
higher frequencies which are much more

133
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,180
suitable I give the example in 14 mag a

134
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,520
easier to connect at 5,000 kilometers

135
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,539
than one who is in bologna

136
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,190
vice versa

137
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,460
in 145 megs or in  70 centimeters which are

138
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,040
430 megs easier to communicate with people

139
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,890
who are close than people who are far away

140
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,700
precisely because it follows not

141
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,880
in quotes it follows sorry a

142
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,360
straight path like light like when you point

143
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,840
a light

144
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,470
what does the antenna do l  'antenna year ago

145
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,690
other than as I said before if

146
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,060
I receive an electromagnetic field it generates

147
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,210
an attention so it is receiving

148
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,370
if it is given a current

149
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,520
electric

150
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,770
with a certain frequency this is

151
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,669
radiated

152
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,760
the antenna to a series of characteristics

153
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,710
which are the resonance which

154
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,690
basically the frequency for which

155
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,120
the antenna was designed if I

156
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,910
take an antenna for the 145 megs it is not

157
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,450
suitable to make them one that  it is at 870

158
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,640
mega

159
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,470
in quotes reception it can

160
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,780
still be used in transmission the losses

161
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,720
are substantial because the antenna does not

162
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,110
resonate for that frequency the

163
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,390
resonance is given precisely by the

164
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,970
physical size of the entella which must

165
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,200
correspond to the one we

166
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,450
saw before actually me  similar to

167
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,500
what we saw earlier that

168
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,920
an antenna for 145 and mega will be about

169
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,840
a meter

170
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,730
because two meters is the wavelength

171
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,490
the antenna usually has already

172
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,890
half a wave

173
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,320
after which it can be omni

174
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,979
directional

175
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:15,360
directive  it means that the signal is

176
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,059
pointed more in a

177
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:19,860
given direction

178
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,399
the dish above is now at

179
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,319
17 16 gb what is it

180
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,959
16

181
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:39,779
16 giga is pointing at  one direction if

182
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,099
he now those of the dish to

183
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,500
turn 5 degrees signal it arrives plus 10

184
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,120
fat it turns completely reverse

185
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,269
signal it loses this because directive

186
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,730
the two antennas are seen as two

187
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,060
batteries pointing to each

188
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,930
other omnidirectional instead it is the classic

189
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,199
vertical stylus i.e. the signal is

190
00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:00,810
radiated  I received with the same

191
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,920
intensity from these we start

192
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,790
and it is almost 360 degrees

193
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,310
of the direction therefore

194
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,350
a little receive without loss from

195
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,139
any direction at the disadvantage of

196
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,240
gaining less

197
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,449
and it is logical that if I take a battery and a

198
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:24,439
100 watt light bulb and turn it on here

199
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,319
they make  light everywhere but less that I

200
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,230
take a glass dish there is if you

201
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,019
use mirrors and point all the light

202
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,180
there will be more concentrated because my

203
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,160
100 watts and are always 100 watts and

204
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,870
bulbs but they are concentrated on a

205
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,449
single point this is  the difference that

206
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,040
substantially from a directional directive

207
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,170


208
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,029
the gain

209
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:49,670
is given by what

210
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,560
we will see later, a

211
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,910
unit of measurement is used which is  ama decibel

212
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,220
that we will see later how it works

213
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,009
substantially the gain is made

214
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,829
referring to a simple dipole therefore to

215
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:08,089
a maison dipole from

216
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:11,509
this gain

217
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:15,750
the more the signal arrives stronger is

218
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,360
gained

219
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,550
compared to that of the pole therefore it is a

220
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,270
difference between a dipole which is

221
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,670
called  very often ds if the db

222
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,279
is isotopic tropic therefore on

223
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,560
the hypo the ideal

224
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,899
with respect to the antenna if gain is

225
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,839
positive if the number is positive it is

226
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,430
gaining if not negative the

227
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,120
antenna is losing

228
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,580
I give the example in my car at

229
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,380
an antenna if you see it which

230
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,410
is probably negative for 144 as

231
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,880
gain because it is smaller than

232
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,070
the wavelength than because I

233
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,920
can't around he concluded while it is

234
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,050
for 70 centimeters it is starting to have gain

235
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,500
because the antenna is around 80

236
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,430
centimeters anyway  70 80 centimeters

237
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,220
another thing is the polarization

238
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,920
the polarization can be horizontal

239
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,080
or vertical

240
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,390
left and whimsical circular left

241
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,149
circular right

242
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:20,730
pe  r satellites for example

243
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,620
communication satellites

244
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,830
can be used if the

245
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,790
right or left circular can be used

246
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,209
the TVs use horizontal you see it

247
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,000
because the antenna is placed horizontal if

248
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,829
you put a horizontal antenna and a

249
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:41,490
vertical one the difference in of b can

250
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,779
go of the winds and  thirty which

251
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,550
corresponds approximately from 100 to 1000 times

252
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,610
signal loss

253
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,890
another example on dishes of that

254
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,300
type you can use double

255
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,070
polarization i.e. what they do they

256
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,570
transmit receive on two

257
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,329
different polarizations so they use

258
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:00,959
the same frequency and the same

259
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,890
antenna for  transmit on two without

260
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,029
interference interfere a lot

261
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:08,180
between them

262
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,920
the impedance

263
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,600
this basically a

264
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,010
characteristic that is provided

265
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,790
in the antenna the usual 50 or 75 in

266
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,790
televisions and 75 usually in these cases

267
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,839
are rite in 50 ohms the difference is that

268
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,300
if  take a tender 58 you should have

269
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,700
the 50 ohm cable and via

270
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,709
transceiver at 58 all the royal

271
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,779
I stop riad amateurs  wings are 50 man

272
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:36,759
so you take the cable 50 the antennas

273
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:39,370
50 permanently it is the impedance

274
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,980
of the antenna

275
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,850
sorry if not only very specific but

276
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,620
we were talking about the decibel unit of

277
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,720
measurement used for

278
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,040
antennas it is the decibel because because it

279
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,279
expresses the ratio between two  magnitudes

280
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,759
and is exponential what is the advantage

281
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,709
of using the db is that it is summable

282
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:07,559
now let's see an example

283
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,139
on the left on the column you see 0 10

284
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:15,120
20db 30db you see that at each jump 40 db

285
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,059
is much greater than 30db because one and a

286
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,360
thousand and l  'another is ten thousand times

287
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,370
so exponential as scale

288
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,199
what is the advantage is that I can

289
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:28,870
do some very fast calculations that later

290
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,490
we see for one hour speech

291
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,220
to see how much it gains or receives to

292
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,709
an antenna that has a gain of 6 of b

293
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:41,500
which means indeed sorry let's make an

294
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,120
example with three of b that the double

295
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,189
compared to maintain trophic therefore

296
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:47,910
earns double

297
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,000
[Music]

298
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,360
and easily addable sorry the

299
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,220
gain of the three of b that is double there is

300
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,920
the se reception therefore receives double

301
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,800
in reception transmits double it

302
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,720
means that if you transmit a watt it is

303
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,000
like transmitting 2 watts on the normal one

304
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,220


305
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,790
on an isotopic one which is the base dipole

306
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,699
the reference one substantially

307
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:17,259
what is the advantage is that in the di b it is

308
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:21,250
possible  to add numerically

309
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,110
so if I have an amplifier that

310
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,809
gains me 16gb

311
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:29,759
I can add the antenna from six of b is

312
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,709
practically by removing two of b

313
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:35,620
I will have 20 types of gain 20db of

314
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,889
gain means that it is a hundred times it

315
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:41,690
can say that I am transmitting  one watt is

316
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,760
as if it were transmitting 100 watts with

317
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,149
the reference antenna

318
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:48,860
therefore it gains a lot this also applies to

319
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,380
reception

320
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,510
when you hear about ragù even it

321
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,199
goes 15 kilometers by itself it is not true

322
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,139
on frequencies we say above the on

323
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:03,769
vhf there is above 50 100  mega where there is

324
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,180
optical visibility there is communication

325
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,070
so if I put the antenna now on

326
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,649
monte grappa and go out here and that's

327
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:15,699
how much monte grappa is it will be

328
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:20,529
60 70 km I can communicate  nicare

329
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:23,209
outside that I don't know with a

330
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:25,579
normal power now are the calculations however

331
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,769
technically if you communicate

332
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,260
if you take into account that the rudd and

333
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,350
material satellites that transit at

334
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,510
a height of 400 kilometers can

335
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,519
communicate with 12 watts and you hear them with the

336
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,269
laptop you understand that  when technically there is

337
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:42,790


338
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,220
optical range there is also communication it is

339
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,410
logical that if I put on an antenna then the

340
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,649
same with its

341
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:54,769
small antenna I attack it with a directive that makes

342
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:58,579
6 of b I manage to gain 6 times

343
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:02,240
sorry four times the signal is

344
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,850
transmission  yes and reception therefore the

345
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,010
communication is much more probable if

346
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,350
I do it from both sides

347
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,750
and even better therefore yes precisely two

348
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,319
directives

349
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,569
that see each other i.e. speak to each other are in the

350
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:18,949
same direction

351
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:21,589
naturally one opposite to the other or

352
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:24,350
my gain and the distance  increases

353
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,790
considerably not slightly but considerably

354
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,949
for information the transmitted signal

355
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,940
degrades by four times each

356
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,540
doubling of the distance

357
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,730
so if and when  or I transmit a

358
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,540
signal this decays to me

359
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,980
every if I have it measures 100 km to 200

360
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,870
kilometers and degraded four times

361
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,529
compared to 100 km

362
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:55,820
this is important for those who use a

363
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,800
cell phone the difference between keeping it here and

364
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:04,419
keeping it on the seat for those who are convinced

365
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:07,069
characteristic  there are various types

366
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,910
of antenna on an athena directive

367
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,410
the main feature is the

368
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,780
main place the red one where

369
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,059
there is the greatest gain

370
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:23,240
as you can see however there is a gain in

371
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,910
reality a loss also from the

372
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,650
back side so he also receives from

373
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,929
the back side  and if you look at all those

374
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:33,679
lateral lobbies he also receives from

375
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,840
those parts

376
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,580
so a directional antenna is not that he

377
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,190
is such and receives only in that direction

378
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,900
but of the lateral lobes these here are a

379
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,450
lot they change a lot depending on the

380
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,670
type of antella that is how it is

381
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,000
built this was an example of

382
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,190
an antenna that you see also for

383
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,980
televisions on TV antennas etc. that

384
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,360
the classic IAG deceives that the two

385
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,530
Japanese who  they invented

386
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,809
it according to the distances between the various

387
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:11,840
elements it can vary it can gain a

388
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,440
lot therefore tighten the frontal lobe and

389
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,020
vice versa have even more lateral lobbies

390
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,620


391
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,050
other

392
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,270
vice versa instead shortening the

393
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,330
antenna reduces the gain but also decreases

394
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,460
the side lobes these are still

395
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,070
things  which are calculated in the

396
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,750
design phase depending on whether I want to have a

397
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,059
curtain that gains a lot

398
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:40,160
or an antenna that also removes

399
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,200
lateral disturbances because if I have

400
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,790
lateral disturbances and I want an antenna

401
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,730
that

402
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,929
has bilateral ones with small

403
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:51,299
facts if you look at those  tv the first

404
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:54,600
and a reflector that serves to remove the

405
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,630
stuff behind in quotation marks you see them that

406
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,230
are made with a curtain, that is, they are made

407
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,929
much more,

408
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:06,480
as we can tell everyone, precisely to

409
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,070
eliminate any disturbances from

410
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,559
emissions of three of televisions of

411
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,620
televisions of televisions

412
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,440
behind  this allows you to have

413
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,409
a vast choice of antennas, as they say,

414
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,259
each element that is added makes

415
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:24,789
au  ment the gain of the entella

416
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,419
therefore the longer and the

417
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,120
more the antenna gains

418
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,039
the problem what is another solution

419
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,090
for not having twenty meters of antenna and

420
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,549
that of coupling them I take this

421
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,789
antenna which gains

422
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,860
between the db I know that by coupling in

423
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,769
a  'other I will have 3 db more attention that

424
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,720
to have three more bs I have to

425
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,460
copy two more so where in the

426
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,799
four to have three more bs

427
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:57,190
I have to n8 and to have three bs high i.e.

428
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,279
double I have to copy 16

429
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,809
so the  thing gets more and more

430
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,360
complicated

431
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,279
so you don't add the db of the antenna

432
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,759
but you add 3 db to each doubling of the

433
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,970


434
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,950
antennas regarding the hour trouble so

435
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,230
antennas of this type calculated for

436
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,220
their troubles that come instead of

437
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,940
using his style  but they are pointed towards the

438
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,280
direction of

439
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,140
the sensors they have a greater gain

440
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,370
so they can go far

441
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,360
beyond 15 km

442
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,650
I'll give an example if you now put the sensors

443
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,600
on grappa and point a

444
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,760
directive at

445
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,980
them you can hear them at 60 kilos  meters away

446
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,990
from the other side it usually becomes

447
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,500
difficult to put a directive on it, however

448
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,100
the logic is that a quarter wave

449
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,480
so that calculation we saw before

450
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,990
divided 4 I divided it in half

451
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,880
can still give better results

452
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,710
than putting a piece of wire at  case

453
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,010
this substance one thing to note is

454
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,380
the connection

455
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,000
cable connection cable that exists between the

456
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,820
radio between receivers and transmitters that it

457
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,040
is and the antenna must be of quality

458
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,299
because that cable loses

459
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,700
yes it is also the connectors there is everything

460
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,700
what stands between the radio

461
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,440
and

462
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,780
transmits sorry antenna must be of

463
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,059
quality so when you first told me

464
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,710
about the microphones of the kun it came to mind

465
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,390
because the mind the cadeaux draw the

466
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,650
dears i.e. the longer cable is more loses

467
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,809
then depending on the type of lucia  of cable

468
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:46,450
there are good cables that lose little and

469
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,820
cables that suck and take more

470
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,320
and logical that the shorter the vaults and the less it

471
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,799
affects the quality let's say of the cable

472
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:59,260
the ditto connectors in the sense that there are

473
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,000
with  nectors made for high frequencies

474
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,280
that are also good on

475
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,700
low frequencies frequencies

476
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,600
connectors made to take this bass

477
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,860
that lose a lot on high frequencies

478
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,030
as I said it is a bit vast to

479
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,130
group them in 20 30 minutes

480
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,690
[Music]

481
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,000
so to have

482
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,070
when today was seen in yesterday sorry for

483
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,460
the  talk where

484
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,760
the yellow ones called s.ma had connectors but

485
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,309
from a point of view if this here

486
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:36,370
instead of putting the gateway on the ground

487
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,340
floor make 50 meters of cable issue a

488
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,790
directive where maybe 50 meters of

489
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,610
cable lose 20db and the  antenna gains

490
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,010
between divi or six of b which does not make sense

491
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,010
because in any case the loss is greater it is

492
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,000
better to put directly above

493
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,250
that is attached to the

494
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,360
antenna and pull up a data cable

495
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,690
which has less

496
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,190
signal loss problems in the sense that 100

497
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,850
meters of cable

498
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,070
network has no major

499
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,890
loss problems and therefore it is from a point of view it

500
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,230
is better to have pond is above that

501
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,690
directive or the vertical if it has

502
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,520
unidirectional sorry if h  needing

503
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,150
to get the data from many directions

504
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,860
another solution could copy four

505
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,840
mini directives i.e.

506
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,010
small directives that make 90 degrees of lobe and

507
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,980
coupling in the four to a greater

508
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,100
gain

509
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,700
greater gain however keeping

510
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,490
the omnidirectional part another thing to

511
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,799
remember is the factor as I said

512
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,450
all  'beginning

513
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,480
of polarization ie if the antenna

514
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,690
emitted vertical also the ici the tenna

515
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,070
on the other side must be put and

516
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,270
vertical

517
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,540
otherwise you have a big big big

518
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,500
unnecessary losses

519
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,350
if there are no fees with questions are

520
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,899
there is a question ruby ​​me more  or less

521
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:18,159
work than technology but I've never

522
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,860
understood decibels sometimes they say that 10

523
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,480
decibels multiplies by ten sometimes it

524
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,789
's 20 decibels which many are true by 10

525
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:26,830
which are the two cases in which we

526
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,380
have to do the calculations differently

527
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,330
regarding power  it is double

528
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,149
on the attention s is quadruple therefore

529
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:36,880
it is taken if understood as power 3 db

530
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,820
and double if instead working on the

531
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,269
voltage is

532
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:45,070
four times as much so it depends on

533
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,320
which unit of measurement since we are talking

534
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,519
about power in this case as we say a

535
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:54,190
3 of b is double 6 of b and four

536
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,549
times

537
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:00,870
three centers questions

538
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,830
on questions the good is given

539
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,279
then thanks a lot to fabiano z
