1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
we are here again with the second turkish

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,980
of the evening this time in presence

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,899
so

4
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:09,620
we are at the crunch materially work

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,190
tonight's second concerns the hour

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,250
therefore hour one is essentially

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,630
an introduction to the

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,109
protocol and in any case this technology

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,660
the speaker is fabrizio vendramin  who is

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,090
innocent of the itis law of Volterra of San

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,780
Donà di Piave and

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,020
has also recently collaborated on a

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,239
project that you see here is called void

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,450
veneto orientale innovation of street

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,570
so Fabrizio saying the floor for

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,500
this short presentation on Orano

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,530
thank you very much it

18
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,500
will be a short presentation that

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,489
sebastiano  he asked me for this

20
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,710
evening so it's about 20 minutes then

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,650
there is a brief space for any

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,869
questions

23
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:08,670
it's not so much a presentation of the

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,430
technology then because it is obviously already

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,409
known but more for

26
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,240
what could be interesting for

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,170
our area

28
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,500
and then all that  which we do

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,740
personally as as boyden group has

30
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,630
not been af  trusted a director from

31
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,369
sebastiano and I collaborate with three other

32
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:34,979
experts, let's say, both on the topic of the time

33
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,320
and also on other similar topics

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,030
concerning advanced domotics, let's say,

35
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,649
the time would

36
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:46,259
mean long range so it

37
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,320
is a methodology for

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,030


39
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,420
transmitting data over long distances

40
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,250
and  so the question that arises

41
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,159
is well what's new there is the novelty that the

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,549
technology then uses

43
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:04,969
very low powers we this is

44
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:07,829
the most revolutionary aspect therefore

45
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,818
transmitting data

46
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:13,819
through radio waves

47
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,980
using very low powers and then

48
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,569
let's see what this implies

49
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,580
first of all  let's say what can

50
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,690
be case studies, i.e. what it

51
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,510
can be used for in the real world we are talking about

52
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,930
smart world here I found a

53
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,750
beautiful one in my opinion image shows

54
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,629
an ideal city this could be

55
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:40,790
let's say

56
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,650
a pineo metropolis slightly different

57
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,620
from

58
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,349
this from our territories however  some

59
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,800
aspects can also be

60
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,080
similar to what can happen

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,160
ap  point also here in the lower Piave or

62
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,459
in any case in the eastern Veneto

63
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:01,019
this representation is interesting

64
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,239
because you see at the base there is a sort of

65
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,120
smart smartphone something

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,879
technological and how it indicates that the

67
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,780
base is a technology

68
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,909
this technology allows you to go and

69
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:17,390
check everything  a series of

70
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,849
situations that we can have in a

71
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,110
metropolis or in any case also

72
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,480
in the countryside let's say no also in

73
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,090
territories near the sea

74
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,780
now I'm sorry because here at least for

75
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,900
those who can see the

76
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,599
representation let's say

77
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,738
projected even bigger

78
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,970
what the publications could be

79
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,750
one by one  example see waste management

80
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,000
how many times maybe we go to the parks

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,920
we see that there are bins

82
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,189
completely overflowing with rubbish and

83
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:59,220
no one goes to empty them here is a system

84
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,299
could be to have a

85
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,060
sensor system that says

86
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,280
the bins are full and here or they are almost

87
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,890
full so we inform the central  that

88
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,720
in that particular place that is that

89
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,250
particular basket that de  ve be

90
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,250
emptied but that seems like a trivial matter

91
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,978
but it can be revolutionary the same is

92
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,918
true instead of perhaps

93
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,919
waste containers that are facing larger

94
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,440
or even more dangerous

95
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,970
another typical example that is already being

96
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,449
implemented even in cities not so

97
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,440
far from ours here in  san

98
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,629
donà smart parking

99
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,190
therefore either with this technology it can

100
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,659
have sensors directly

101
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:42,720
implanted on the ground each parking lot

102
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,870
will have its own sensor and therefore I know

103
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,440
exactly if at a certain moment

104
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
the free space is occupied

105
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,680
so not only maybe if I find a

106
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,139
free parking  you can therefore

107
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,720
go and park my car

108
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,280
not only know how many

109
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,659
parking spaces but I could also have an

110
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:05,849
exact precise indication of where that

111
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:07,469
free parking space or if there are

112
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:08,880
many

113
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,940
a vehicle perhaps controlled by an

114
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,110
artificial intelligence could

115
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,629
even go to  park in

116
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:18,539
the nearest parking lot or maybe among

117
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:21,270
the free ones the most v  near

118
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,610
where I will get off andreoli carmine place

119
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,430
that interests me

120
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,990
the questions can also be very

121
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,860
complex

122
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,979
another question that you see maybe more

123
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:38,370
let's say towards the center and to the right there is

124
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,560
a car crossing a

125
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,349
bridge

126
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:44,819
unfortunately here we know very well what it is

127
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,650
that success with the tragedy of having

128
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,319
morandi ready it is very important to

129
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,169
have sensors that go from checking to

130
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:55,050
monitoring the state of health of the bridges

131
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,949
in my opinion there will be an increasing need for them

132
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:00,560
also this type of sensor can be,

133
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,599
let's say, connected to this

134
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:06,960
methodology  transmission and so on

135
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,880
another example which unfortunately has also

136
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,270
become dramatic

137
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,780
very recently the fires

138
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,750
I can put a series of sensors

139
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,640
scattered even in a very very

140
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,160
large area

141
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,260
and which we say allow us to

142
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,390
control

143
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,310
the development of fires even in a

144
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,080
very short time and therefore  to be able to go

145
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,870
directly to the affected area and

146
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,280
go and put out the fire in any

147
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,060
case  are to make an intervention

148
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,770
and so on in short, another example of

149
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,770
people who come to mind jesolo

150
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,140
we know that there is also a whole

151
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,260
area dedicated to golf go to

152
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,450
hariri races in an intelligent way a

153
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,360
golf course can be very

154
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,820
productive because i can manage to

155
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,640
use as little water as possible

156
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,740
therefore avoid wasting water in

157
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,240
a nutshell I can have a

158
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,760
sensor that checks the humidity

159
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,510
of the soil and from there it will know the calculations to

160
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,760
understand if it is appropriate to wet

161
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,260
the soil naturally even if it is already there

162
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,990
too much water and so on

163
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,280
so the perspective can also be

164
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,890
to implement a saving of

165
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,410
basic resources such as water and so on

166
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,940
now I won't go too far however

167
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,220
possibly then

168
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,750
this is only the presentation of a

169
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,630
broader work that we will do  so then

170
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,050
sebastiano in short our guest

171
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,500
will show you these these slides everything

172
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,750
will go immediately so it is a job that will

173
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,850
develop over time also with

174
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,840
techno solutions  logic of

175
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,950
hardware and software prototypes however this is

176
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,580
only the beginning

177
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,150
I move for a moment to try to

178
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,640
understand what our

179
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,340
declination

180
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,350
is, i.e. what Bastiano told me from taxes

181
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,770
that he wanted to implement and therefore

182
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,449
we held a series of

183
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,800
study meetings to be able  i.e. starting what

184
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,810
can I really tell the time about in our

185
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,490
area because in the end we have

186
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,870
a mandate nor eastern berto sorry for

187
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,889
the aspects related to environmental data

188
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:26,660


189
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,520
in something that was very interesting to

190
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,780
go and study environmental data

191
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,219
where for the environment  we can understand

192
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,799
both the

193
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,169
natural and artificial environment here our

194
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,370
problem was to collect

195
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,900
natural and artificial environmental data

196
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,070
in our territory i.e. our

197
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,170
territory provides us with these data gives

198
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,620
us these opportunities let's say

199
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,540
each territory pro and its

200
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,060
peculiarities

201
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,540
this network of sensors then

202
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,709
allows you to collect this data and

203
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,630
we must, however, have this important to

204
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,570
have a fruition  and free

205
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,370
there are networks instead they are that they are

206
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,959
proprietary and therefore these data are

207
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,820
collected by the company and are not

208
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,430
given to the public in our case instead

209
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,560
since the philosophy I think you

210
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,529
also know of this laboratory is to

211
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,020
be very open source we are also

212
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,100
very open  on the data therefore we want to

213
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,450
allow free use

214
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,880
via the web or via app therefore also the cloud is a

215
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,970
crime by the citizenry or by

216
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,250
the institutions of the territory therefore

217
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,600
citizen wants to have information

218
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,180
on his territory at the level of

219
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,089
sensors well he will be able to do it in

220
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:48,380
our let's say in the  our development will be

221
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,209
absolutely free

222
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:53,010
not only but then all the projects will be

223
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,680
free so everyone will then be able to make them

224
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,690
their own also modify them also then

225
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,730
present them why not

226
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,290
to present their own solutions

227
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,839
this is our idea of ​​creating a

228
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,510
network of people

229
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,660
interested in these topics  it's a

230
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,220
very obvious type of data it's weather data

231
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,899
therefore with these sensors we can

232
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,370
collect the temperature and the

233
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,139
atmospheric pressure on the

234
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:21,510
city direction of the wind the humidity of the air to the

235
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,149
precipitations see the cloudiness and

236
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,639
therefore in the end make some weather

237
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,180
forecasts but at a local level so

238
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,839
let's say micron

239
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,980
sebastiano told me well here with us

240
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,769
in short, we are also famous

241
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,750
for agriculture and lately it is also

242
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,899
excluding viticulture there is a

243
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,290
very strong return

244
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,810
but which personally in short, in the family

245
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,019
or a sister who has

246
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,839
recently acquired also on viticulture it

247
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,360
produces prosecco

248
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,269
and pinot gris among other things it is in these

249
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:00,640


250
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,850


251
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,930
agronomic zones [Music] so for example I can

252
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,310
go and see the quantity of oxygen

253
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,930
of water of nutrients how much light

254
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,819
arrives in the final moment the humidity of the

255
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:14,279
soil and on this I can carry out

256
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,730
studies what we say most obvious is

257
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,649
viticulture it

258
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:22,199
is good very spontaneous a  he other

259
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,290
challenge that sebastiano proposed to me is more

260
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,060
complex in my opinion technologically

261
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,399
speaking  ndo is the whole world of hydro

262
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,670
monica,

263
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,579
i.e. there is this

264
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:37,100
complex possibility to study

265
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,779
something else and the quality of the air and

266
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,019
water

267
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:45,180
and alright let's touch on topics which

268
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,750
in short are more and more

269
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,209
like saying that they always affect  more

270
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,310
people's sensitivity no lately

271
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,829
there is a great awareness of

272
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:57,829
what the environmental problem is

273
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:59,569
and therefore

274
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:01,860
I want to understand what is the quality of the

275
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,569
air that I am breathing that

276
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:05,579
my children breathe and the same also of the

277
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:06,560
water

278
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,930
there are  sensors even recently they

279
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,970
also produce very very cheap ones

280
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,259
that allow the detection it pursues

281
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:18,829
beautiful I also have them in the

282
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:22,829
area pm 10 pm 2.5 and so on with a series

283
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,589
of pollutants

284
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:27,240
an idea that I too have had for a long time

285
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,060
also because in short  a school of

286
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,940
technological study is to create

287
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,029
detection control units no of

288
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,550
these

289
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,639
let's say of these of these pollutants

290
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,620
obviously through this network it is also

291
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,350
with adequate software to go then

292
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,540
possibly  both to present graphs but

293
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,360
possibly also to raise an alarm

294
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,709
clearly all these things are already

295
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,930
implemented at an institutional level much

296
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,399
more we would like to make sure

297
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,430
that the population too we say because the

298
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,190
population we say

299
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,649
is a bit of a hacker we say you like this

300
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,670
type of technology may be interested

301
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,509
another proposal was to

302
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:12,350
build an aquatic drone which then

303
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,730
navigates and collects data

304
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,410
regarding the quality especially

305
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,110
of

306
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,300
the water the study of the parking lots no therefore

307
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,910
the use in the case of because we

308
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,839
are already discussed

309
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,170
here for a moment we also wanted to create  an app for

310
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,930
a poor woman just a web app to be given

311
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:34,970
to

312
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,250


313
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,199
users for free and therefore yes I can

314
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:41,430
go and see what the parking situations are

315
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,399


316
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,569
in the area

317
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:47,730
we should take a sensor in the meantime

318
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,870
and test it with that no

319
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,810
and then from there in short  develop

320
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,639
develop a solution

321
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,350
another interesting thing is the study of

322
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,639
traffic with regard to

323
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,740
cars  no vehicles i.e. understand what kind

324
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,470
of ridiculous cars

325
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,510
let's say our areas traffic

326
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,699
in what direction and therefore also what

327
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:11,009
times there are these various stronger directions

328
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:13,860
from san donà to outside or

329
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,720
vice versa at certain times it takes a

330
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,089
moment to understand

331
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,740
all this can be implemented with

332
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,400


333
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,650
I repeat this technology also with a series of sensors

334
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,230
edited in technology in the end

335
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,940
really low cost they are very very within

336
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,240
everyone's reach

337
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,170
that of garbage containers

338
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,020
we had already talked for a moment an idea

339
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,510
could be to provide a pa

340
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,280
of ecological operators therefore they

341
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,380
they see directly where they have to go

342
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,160
intervene

343
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,340
the time however it cannot be developed if there

344
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,980
is no network

345
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,990
in fact it was specially designed by

346
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,220
letter wan wide area network and therefore

347
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,780
in the end even with this technology

348
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,490
I can create a network that

349
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,860
embraces

350
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,760
the urban environment, let's say

351
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,410
this data is collected through a

352
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,830
network of sensors which therefore concerns the

353
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,680
youth il  the internet of things is no longer

354
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,470
a new thing, it is becoming

355
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,170
more and more popular now,

356
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,120
point out one thing, however, what is the

357
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,880
difference with other types of networks, for

358
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,360
example, a network that I don't know about wifi, a network

359
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,810
managed in other

360
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,600
ways, we are interested in data that  by their

361
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,240
nature they

362
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,860
do not require a

363
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,850
very fast transmission structure because because

364
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,190
we are going to collect little data in the

365
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,200
sense of a few bytes at the end and we have to

366
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,410
transmit these few bytes

367
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,110
even asynchronously or even synchronously

368
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,970
depending on how

369
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,030
the problem is, however

370
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:07,270
we therefore do not need a channel

371
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,340
transmission particularly capable

372
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,800
because the bytes are few so this is not

373
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,390
the problem which is one of the big

374
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,069
problems that we have taken that 5 gb

375
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,600
but we want to do it with very

376
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,180
large territories and at the same time using

377
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,660
very low powers understood which seem

378
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,600
to kind of want the  barrel full and

379
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,730
drunk wife and everything else

380
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,200
actually with this technology you

381
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,990
can do it

382
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,010
so I want to have  and a technology

383
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,150
that allows this data to be sent

384
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,800
via nodes that collect

385
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,110
information that have very low

386
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,390
energy consumption,

387
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,160
possibly must be

388
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,450
self-powered perhaps by a battery

389
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,630
a small solar cell and can

390
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,860
power a small battery that

391
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,600
powers this device that has

392
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,060
very low consumption  primary for those present here for

in short,

396
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,420
the collection of data then takes place

397

through a gateway it is also a

398

higher consumption because of its own it must  being more

to do now

the company that distributes the

food, but I see that these people

go and check practically every evening

they arrive and  they check the state of

the problem brilliantly

you see that all these nodes go in a

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,690
pattern here you can see they go to send

457

this data to these concentrators they

458

are practically gateways  that collect

the data it is

460
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,570
important to understand that the gatelys however

461
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,730
then it must be connected let's say to the

this thing so it's not paid

475

paid sections clearly for those who make it a

profession

478
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,970
there is an application server therefore  in the

479
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,070
end all this data must be

480
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,659
managed in some way and therefore software can be

481
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,159
written to go and

482
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,700
analyze the data

483
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:49,350
the transmission can take place ready to the

484
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,119
contrary that is, once

485
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,220
I read them maybe there is for example a fire

486
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,720
with my way that  he tells me look that there is

487
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,879
a fire

488
00:20:55,879 --> 00:21:00,840
I detect the software let's say take

489
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,419
this away as an action so on the contrary

490
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,970
I can have maybe a simple

491
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,919
fire extinguishing system which is to put out the fire

492
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,360
so it's not just a matter of

493
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,639
collecting data but you can also

494
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:14,360
send them  of data and actuators

15 that we say it in full

496
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,549
so here's how I said we have both

497
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:28,019
sensors and actuators there is this

498
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:28,879
possibility

00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:34,279
I give you two names  one is the things network

500
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:37,789
and probably ttn is a dutch start-up

501
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:40,740
that raised a

502
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,320


503
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,499
discreet amount of euros in a crowd funding campaign, let's say, and

504
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:48,720
therefore launched this idea of

505
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,450
this free and open-to-all network,

506
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,210
I repeat, however, there is also a part now

507
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,230
that  another cirps heel may be available for a fee

508
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,879
which, even if it is

509
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:05,009
widely used,

510
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:08,059
are the 23 mainly competing,

511
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:10,860
let's say, for the market

512
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,030
per hour in short,

513
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,590
here as nodes

514
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,309
now we are using the mkr 1310

515
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,710
not the one that the engineer who

516
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,240
already spoke to me for months  ago

517
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,420
we had already done some tests with these technologies

518
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,020
he here from san donà

519
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,170
used the mkr 1300 it is based on

520
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,990
alduino technology they are

521
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,700
really very well made cards what

522
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,740
we took anyway they are made

523
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,460
assembled in italy and however they will come out

524
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,820
shortly literally the  usual clones and then

525
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,470
you have to make a selection an evaluation

526
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,950
and above all as soon as we wanted to

527
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,660
buy this way we said

528
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,260
okay let's do it  or in reality we have

529
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,360
discovered that the next version has come out

530
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,110
the 1310 consumes

531
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,600
even less are devices that are

532
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,370
really very little this consumes

533
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,870
even less and has the possibility of having

534
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,370
an internal memory where I go to

535
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,830
store data so if I

536
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,380
send my cat to the  gateway however

537
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,600
the gateway for some reason

538
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,190
cannot read the data I can follow

539
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,740
the reasons anyway with this time

540
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,419
technology I can go memorize

541
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:34,980
my data so never an operator

542
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,679
manually at some point go

543
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,450
directly to the field let's say and

544
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,549
acquire this data so we have

545
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:45,270
I chose the 1910 version first because

546
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,890
the year without this even less than the

547
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,450
normal one then because of this

548
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,169
peculiarity

549
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,540
which but now it currently seems to me that

550
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,200
we travel on about 40 euros more or less per

551
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,720
piece a small antenna is also included

552
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,660


553
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,830
if you want you can put it instead  a

554
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,059
more powerful antenna that is still bigger if

555
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:11,520
we say need to transmit data

556
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,110
perc  hé maria somehow they

557
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,940
can't arrive everything plays a

558
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,660
lot on the antennas

559
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,820
last thing

560
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,890
the gately gateways were kindly

561
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,420
offered to me

562
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,710
let's say bought his strange

563
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,600
there were two possibilities basically

564
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,730
either buy a ready-made gateway

565
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,290
crib san donaci is a person who  he

566
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,020
already has this gateway ready he

567
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,440
plugged it in working order everything is fine

568
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,430
another possibility that we have instead

569
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,200
evaluated is that of having a

570
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,260
gateway that is still performing but that

571
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,090
was

572
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,200
expandable that it was a skilled hacker

573
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,980
because in short this is the philosophy that

574
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,310
has always accompanied the activities of

575
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,180
now  I called

576
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,340
the club's innovation lab anyway

577
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,890
in the past

578
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,770
we have therefore chosen this technology

579
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,540
the awarding evaluation is Chinese but in

580
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,610
any case it is not a Chinese one as they say

581
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,260
in the students this one plus a Chinese one

582
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,440
of and that is still done quite well

583
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,450
if the company currently open it to

584
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,700
go the chassis  in aluminum

585
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,210
this two sockets on one side I can

586
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,370
insert qu  this antenna that

587
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,360
is supplied with an antenna then

588
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,230
and on the side you see they gave it more

589
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,110
so I said it's fine if we take it

590
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,950
there is also a gps antenna

591
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,840
where spontaneous illness and well but if I or

592
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,960
the gateway green stall I already know  because they

593
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,120
are the gps coordinates what I'm interested in

594
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,250
having an antenna

595
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,720
in reality the antenna could be

596
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,280
used because perhaps this gateway can

597
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,050
be carried around perhaps to

598
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,800
detect, for example, as we said before,

599
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,090
the quality of the air and therefore it is not

600
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,750
necessary to go to each time  setting

601
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,180
the gps coordinates is a little more

602
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,520
let's say it was already supplied so he said

603
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,920
we keep it there is its small

604
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,920
power supply an sd card to

605
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,330
load the operating system in this

606
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,130
case

607
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,260
we opted for barry ios

608
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,540
in fact this model of gateway

609
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,990
to all  'interior aulos barry p4

610
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,880
generally it can be programmed in c

611
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,940
or in my case I prefer python

612
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,070
then as instead the node that has seen me

613
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,990
previously since the two generals

614
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,330
telo progra  Let's talk with the luino board

615
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,310
so there are also various possibilities from

616
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,149
a programming point of view

617
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,490
now it's a matter of making

618
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,030
the experiments go ahead anyway

619
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,470
I was also told that there are some

620
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,720
experts I don't know if a present from this

621
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,260
evening I will gladly hear from antenna supporters who

622
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,420
could therefore  tell us that

623
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,690
best antenna then to be able to connect this

624
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:12,740
gateway on the ceiling of this structure

625
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,890
because we have so now I have it at

626
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,950
home and it pulls the maximum one kilometer

627
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,930
obviously with the right antenna put

628
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,790
in the right position this technology

629
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,270
can reach 20 kilometers of  radius

630
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,680
then and it was to put one in

631
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,350
san donà for example one from the parts of

632
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,550
portoguaro and therefore have a large

633
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:42,150
coverage in this way with two three of

634
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,800
yours he woke up a very

635
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,550
very large coverage last thing

636
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,780
[Music]

637
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,320
I also chose this gately  because

638
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,810
when the gateway is connected to the

639
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,830
cloud of the things network and the things

640
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,870
at work it absolutely wants gods  gateways

641
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,510
that have at least eight channels

642
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,600
are really 8 16 question 8 there are

643
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,910
glasses that you can find that have even

644
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,920
one channel on them cost much less

645
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,920
this costs about 200 euros you can do

646
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,290
some tests so with much less less

647
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,210
solid they know but then they don't come

648
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,370
accepted by the things network because

649
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,190
it is said that you need to have at least eight

650
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,620
channels in short, to

651
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,570
have

652
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,760
a gate of classic level

653
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,490
both performing

654
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,780
and here president so if maybe

655
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,390
someone is interested let's

656
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,059
see for a moment

657
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:40,540
I don't know if I played the twenty minutes

658
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,110
I think  no I don't know

659
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:50,080
yes thanks fabrizio in the meantime we have some

660
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,300
questions from the public because now it's a

661
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,840
bit also the part of the possible

662
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,970
questions from the public

663
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:03,880
so a moment I'll join you

664
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:08,270
here the sensors have a

665
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,540
directional antenna or not

666
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,530
generally the ones we are

667
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,350
using now

668
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,390
a  'antenna let's say directional but

669
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,730
if you want easily it is a very question

670
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,460
to become may have some a

671
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,520
directional antennas so increase range

672
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,440
and efficiency yes that's a question

673
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,660
right right that earthly important

674
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,660
the broadcast system uses a

675
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,480
spread spectrum system then this

676
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,110
broadcast system

677
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,300
[Music]

678
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,820
let's say the antenna we have

679
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,750
here in europe with a  trip 868 mag i

680
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,640
know

681
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,200
types transmission not number i'm

682
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,360
something studied i'm more of a computer scientist

683
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,590
so for me less interesting that it works

684
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,050
but this aspect is a moment

685
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,110
to see

686
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,929
another question

687
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:04,850
instead i want to say first of all that

688
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,370
even if a development of a bin

689
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,290
of the  'garbage

690
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,830
with the sensor to detect

691
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,000
if the garbage can is full 6 empty

692
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,609
without

693
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:18,899
who has already made it yes yes yes yes

694
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:22,129
certainly because then if a solution

695
00:30:22,129 --> 00:30:24,539
comes from been presented by specialized says

696
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,159
who therefore already have the

697
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,509
resolutions ready prix to the  technology

698
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:29,090
is new

699
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,889
but lately I see that as soon as

700
00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:33,919
something new appears

701
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,330
modern in a very short time it goes

702
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,989
s  ubito in saturation

703
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:41,190
for him it was more important than anything else to

704
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,340
propose these aspects to an audience of

705
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,820
hobbyists above all

706
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,339
and then another question instead in the case

707
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:54,419
of the use to detect cars and

708
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,799
I saw that there is a company

709
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,369
called gavazzi that  it makes

710
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:01,799
cylinders to be buried and through

711
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,519
electromagnetic wave detection

712
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:08,339
and detects if there is the vehicle above if

713
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:10,469
it were buried in the dam it could

714
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,560
still reach it

715
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,730
could work even buried a

716
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,150
few centimeters or

717
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,340
the antenna is so not very powerful that if

718
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,720
we put it ten  centimeters under the ground it

719
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,550
doesn't get anywhere anymore

720
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,200
I think it's like this you need to do a

721
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,880
moment of testing then it depends that the

722
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,010
transmission power with those

723
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,870
I've seen too

724
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,370
let's say they are logically interned

725
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,350
on the ground then we're talking about

726
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,690
parking so if in those years

727
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,370
we want to become uses of fiom I

728
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,680
don't know where there is the concrete the successes can

729
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,620
easily be reached perhaps

730
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,260
more than 5 centimeters and or curious  to

731
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,030
know if you had ever tried it and if it

732
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,610
worked even once buried

733
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,860
we are studying to use a

734
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,830
sensor that is, however, let's

735
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,800
say visual,

736
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,560
ok thanks but we also have a

737
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,270
trick question

738
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,220
now

739
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,850
let's see

740
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,520
maurizio

741
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,620
ask him by tweet on which frequencies he goes to

742
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,950
800 then in europe and 868 mega suv giga

743
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,600
in the united states is slightly higher

744
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,610
for there was a version in europe

745
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,670
prior to 433 meyers however we now

746
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:28,590
use the 868 antenna which is

747
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,360
also present in this rack according to

748
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,700
also written what  be careful to

749
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,990
buy the right antenna because

750
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:38,130
otherwise the transmission breaks down

751
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,230
one last semi question defined it

752
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,710
then from what i know

753
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,770


754
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,370
to pass through the

755
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,740
data objects need some

756
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,360
frequency need because some can be

757
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,550
blocked by  simple piece of south and some

758
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,680
power so maybe with a

759
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,710


760
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:06,070
good frequency it's a good power that is given it

761
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,010
is possible and you pass even with a pa  I of

762
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:13,910
centimeters of wall of so it wants so

763
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,440
it's caliber it was a bit this thing

764
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,900
in my opinion

765
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,750
yes let's say I'm testing at home

766
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,170
so they are substances here anyway

767
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,360
surrounded by walls and transmissions it

768
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,760
still manages to happen

769
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,370
we have to say how reliable it is in short

770
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,960
well then  there are no more questions

771
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,840
a big thank you to fabrizio vendramin

772
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,230
for sharing your experience and

773
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,660
knowledge on this topic thank you
