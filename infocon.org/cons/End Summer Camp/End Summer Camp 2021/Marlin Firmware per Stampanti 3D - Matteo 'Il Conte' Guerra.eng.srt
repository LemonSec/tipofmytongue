1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
and we have the last tower of the evening

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,480
which is that of matteo il conte guerra and

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,830
we are talking about 3d printing therefore

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,870
basically the firmware that is used

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,430
for printers now matter will

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,830
explain in a little more

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,630
detail what we are talking about

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,539
and the talent that  at a basic level therefore

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,590
we have called this talk apc

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,270
because in any case it can also be useful for

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,070
those who are the

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,550
first to approach 3d printing for

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,960
the first time

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,690
well then I can tell you

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,430
and then we will see you later

16
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,980
then we have a little monitor we can see

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,930
just

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,890
a  moment the presentation

19
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,640
here we are then the first slide is not good

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,830
15 abc marin firmware for

21
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,260
3d printers or how not to

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,420
set your house on fire why this

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,540
subtitle because many beginners

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,020
when they buy their first 3d printer

25
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,430
also says a cheap printer

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,890
so i'm talking about printed matter  like a

27
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,360
and her 3r a net 8 and this whole

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,909
family very often come with

29
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,689
firmware that we could define as

30
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:34,079
basic  they do not include

31
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,850
features it is important but let's go

32
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,049
in order for a moment

33
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,490
otherwise I will answer all the

34
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,329
content

35
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,780
then little historical nod marley

36
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,409
firmware marlin fw dot org for those who

37
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,329
want to go to the site was born in 2011

38
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,880
was born as a

39
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,780
firm rejoiced for the open source community des for reprap  it's

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,959
not a project that perhaps doesn't say anything to most people

41
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,659
but it was the first project

42
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,490
that set itself the goal of being

43
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,619
able to make a printer from

44
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,080
another printer

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,049
models such as the darwin or the mendel

46
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,660
always for enthusiasts these are names

47
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,540
we could define

48
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,239
the first steps were evocative

49
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,379
obviously we need a firmware that

50
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,440
was able to reconcile these these

51
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,540
experiments with the hardware that was there

52
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,489
at the time that we could define it as

53
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:32,000
derived from the arduini so

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,769
atmel I'm talking about 8 bits we are not

55
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:36,959
talking about the great powers  of course

56
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,359
we are also talking about

57
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,000
very basic motor control parts compared

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,109
to what we have now and was born c  not

59
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:47,670
with simplicity

60
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,190
currently ten years have passed

61
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,069
about 10 years if you wanted to realize

62
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,519
even in 2091 the advantage that

63
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:57,959
since the technology has progressed

64
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,139
we also have support for 32-

65
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,060
bit chips therefore what was unthinkable at the time

66
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,010


67
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,780
or have

68
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,930
a processor that

69
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,160
is  smartphone to give an idea of

70
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,470
power

71
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,599
and above all the real advantage of

72
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,760
release 2 is a huge focus on

73
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,980
safety there are many more controls at

74
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,530
the printer level what it should do what

75
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,750
it shouldn't do when you will find everything stop

76
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,709


77
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,660
in case the parameters don't return to the

78
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,540
due

79
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,340
as I was starting to say following

80
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,419
the 20 numerous manufacturers there has been

81
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:38,540
a refinement of the printers

82
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,319
especially in the pa in the

83
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,060
economic range because we have moved on to having

84
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,040
printers at prices that were once

85
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,690
unimaginable

86
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,169
or 100 150 euros if one can

87
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,040
trivially open  numerous online and

88
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,750
find them at these prices when at

89
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,580
the time even commercial printers co  n

90
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,240
were about 30 thousand are in 90

91
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,370
percent of cases kinematics the three

92
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,090
what does it mean if one opens the

93
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,580
store sees it is a

94
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,660
Cartesian kinematics so I'm talking about at least

95
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,730
one motor for each axis on hicks

96
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,130
on ypsilon on z more  at least one

97
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,930
dedicated to the excluder that serves to

98
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,649
push the filament onto the plate

99
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,270
all these printers have one thing in

100
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,780
common that marlin or rather

101
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,030
its absence or reworking because the

102
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,520
manufacturers for you cut the corner and

103
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,289
save on development

104
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,650
sorry I see a  moment a technical problem

105
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,530


106
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,720
better

107
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,960
excellent for the engines to save

108
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,319
in development they

109
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,970
cut many functions or they were

110
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,099
based on version 1 if not

111
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:55,440
even on a release candidate I'm

112
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,240
talking about the skynet firmware than the

113
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,090
aforementioned net 8

114
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,599
and since we are we could say of the micros

115
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:05,759
however of the  enthusiasts is not

116
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,039
something we like to have no one

117
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:11,009
wants to have something

118
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,650
dangerous in the house too  because a lot

119
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,080
these are two photos of the 22 prints

120
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,210
that i mentioned before on my left

121
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,870
is the net 8 on the right vender 3

122
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,979
this is an image of what

123
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,479
happens when the film does its

124
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,430
job this one printer is on

125
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,120
fire  as there was

126
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,860
a break the thermistor that

127
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,710
controls the extruder therefore at the

128
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,710
firmware level the message arrived that

129
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,380
there are zero degrees at the excluder and the

130
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,120
printer thought it best to continue

131
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,159
to give current to the resistance

132
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,860
the temperature  it rose to 300 400 500

133
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,210
600 degrees which are

134
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,340
absolutely out of place temperatures

135
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,259
the plastic components started to

136
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,419
melt they caught fire and all the

137
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,130
rest of the frame ended up as you can

138
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,639
see in the picture a serious firmware as I said

139
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,440
before marlin when he realizes that  the

140
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,180
current but does not rise the temperature

141
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,139
cuts and by error

142
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,719
and because pass pass is easy

143
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,909
fortunately as I said before the movie which

144
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:13,830
is based on marlin pass marin is

145
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,909
very simple

146
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,080
the  most of the printers also

147
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,520
officially supported by the community

148
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,759
what does it mean that you don't have to go

149
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,650
crazy getting configuration files one goes

150
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,930
to the repository one looks for the name of

151
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,849
one's printer finds the files already

152
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:29,660
configured feeds them all the

153
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,010
program and later i will show you the logo and

154
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,290
second  platform and or to compile and

155
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,479
magically everything goes first time it's

156
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,310
customizable optimizable what

157
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,220
does this mean that

158
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,970
customize them as long as it is then I

159
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,020
can make changes to

160
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,780
my printer and when the change I can

161
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,639
change the firmware so seas

162
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,900
I want to add a

163
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,430
leveling sensor that on mine  printer

164
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,620
wasn't there I add it I go to the firmware I

165
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,449
look for the items that interest me the

166
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:56,300
skills and this function can't even be

167
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,250
optimized what this

168
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,040
sentence means we know that every printer, even if

169
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,270
it is of the same model, each

170
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,889
copy is always slightly different

171
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:05,449
maybe we always need to give a

172
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,639
adjust lists for engine

173
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,530
or more simply each of us

174
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,669
lives in a house that we could define as

175
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,590
different so marin my house can

176
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,880
be more humid than the house

177
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,100
of another or another printer you can act as a

178
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,680
marlin and adjust these parameters which

179
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,350
obviously means having some

180
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,419
prints  the best as I have to before it is

181
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:25,190
updated to all the

182
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,690
necessary safety religions

183
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,600
and it is also extremely ductile because

184
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,310
it is pre as mentioned before it lends

185
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,510
modifications compared to the original product

186
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,320
very extensive modifications can be made

187
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,300
we are not talking only about adding marin an extra

188
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,610
sensor a sensor  in less than a

189
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,800
change of engine you can revolutionize

190
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,340
a printer and update and update and

191
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,710
regulate the film accordingly it's like

192
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,700
preference what you need to

193
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,539
switch to marvin but not and a pc server

194
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:00,789
vs cod

195
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:02,900
a program that manages the

196
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,849
compilation and also the writing is

197
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,919
used  to do source code but it's

198
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,419
very easy to see also for a

199
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:11,570
platform io which is a plugin

200
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,240
an extension designed to interact with

201
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,490
electronic boards and we will have to

202
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,139
ban that mouth the brain club

203
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,599
or of our printer its

204
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,220
marling agent which is always downloaded from

205
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,620
marlin firmware there are various links

206
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,690
ready both true uniform established less

207
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,370
stable if someone yes  feels in an

208
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,429
exploratory mood usb cables enough

209
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,649
are two variants that a marin one can

210
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:36,120
have a board has slightly different

211
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,700
needs for a micro sd

212
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,559
primary collector in his film he updates

213
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,779
via microsd or via an

214
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,300
arduino some slightly more awkward boards

215
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,980
we could define them because instead  having

216
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,140
a convenient usb connection is a

217
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,790
three button on your computer

218
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,180
you need to play with urbino for a moment

219
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,560
the topic of rwe i will

220
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,149
not take it into consideration tonight

221
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:59,209
because it is very specific to the board

222
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:01,920
as giovanni muciaccia would say

223
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,720
toilet paper and glue  vinyl but I would say that

224
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,589
for today you don't need

225
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,940
the quick introduction avs cod you need to

226
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,380
study code an ed  its source code

227
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,500
source is very ductile very versatile

228
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,610
very convenient for changing the parameters

229
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,399
as it can see what

230
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,899
the firmware contains so based on our

231
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,820
changes it shows us

232
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,140
which parameters have been

233
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,880
changed because some changes are

234
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,529
between purple cascade  enabling a

235
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:27,089
parameter if other sub-

236
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:29,130
parameters militate ue according to heaven it highlights

237
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,790
by changing the colors and helps us and

238
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,709
also includes a console which therefore we will

239
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:36,810
also have the guided compilation so in

240
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,700
case of errors we will not be groping

241
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,089
in the dark but there will be a

242
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:43,200
beautiful error a beautiful

243
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,790
warning  which mentions never to check

244
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,820
that parameter which perhaps is wrong and you

245
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,260
had to install plugins in particular

246
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,910
transform which is very immediate

247
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,279
platform as mentioned before the plugin

248
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,779
allows dialogue what does it mean

249
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,100
allows dialogue which can not only

250
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,050
be used to upload and download the

251
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,860
firmware it can  also be used to

252
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,820
check the edge it can also

253
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,560
interact with laborde see any

254
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,660
behaviors and certainly this hasn't

255
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,640
worked for a moment more advanced however it

256
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,380
makes you understand how effective the tool can be

257
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,700
in managing

258
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,170
everything

259
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,880
I take the opportunity to exit the presentation for a moment

260
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,860


261
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,720
I go for a moment to address I try to

262
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,100
take some steps unfortunately  it's not a

263
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,980
3d printer here with me with which to

264
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,649
show a camera guy what needs

265
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:35,190
to be done i show the program so it's

266
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,549
[Music]

267
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:38,739
one can have an idea

268
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,899
then this is vs cod on startup it

269
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:44,029
comes in our way so

270
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:45,819
forgive me

271
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:50,529
not  I have it, sorry to

272
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:56,799
split,

273
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,449
let's do this because unfortunately I have to

274
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:03,079
speak too, he projected it, so

275
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,850
how can we see this is the program input,

276
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,730
the more experienced will have already

277
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,860
noticed that I have already installed the platform, I am

278
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,009
supported by those with alien adi

279
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:15,110
who  on the left is the last

280
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,989
icon of the high-end to

281
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:19,730
install it you can very trivially

282
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,069
go

283
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:23,569
let's see if you follow me my goodness what is

284
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:25,509
c  omplicated spoke like this

285
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:28,989
go to the

286
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:39,309
fantastic section for a mouse

287
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:04,799
here I am

288
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,939
and the day billiards hand charm

289
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:13,559
I would say environment pico

290
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,019
then because no one is late it's very

291
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:20,709
difficult okay let's say

292
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,079
this part for a moment because otherwise

293
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,079


294
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:27,759


295
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,660


296
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:44,259
I'm going crazy but there's another morning adjustment unify warning here I am  here now it should look better

297
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:47,279
a little worse or better

298
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:52,689
I can show you how to install it

299
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:57,539
goes to section 48

300
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,890
here we are in the plus section

301
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,920
stations section a search opens here you can

302
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,560
search for platform io and it is here in this

303
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,810
case already installed there would be a

304
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,460
beautiful  key that I wrote in the store

305
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,190
one installs it based on the power of

306
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,810
one's computer it can take from

307
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,950
thirty seconds to 5 minutes it's not at all

308
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,360
once we have a ready away

309
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,770
our beautiful alien icon

310
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,630


311
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:30,230
appears 1 click the gem and the key appears for

312
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,740
open the

313
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,330
open the folder where the firmware is

314
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,540
in what sense the

315
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,390
folder our beautiful

316
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,430
firmware can

317
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,470
be downloaded e  d is a folder this case

318
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,630
marlin 2.0 and the configurations are also downloaded there

319
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,420
are other folders in

320
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,360
preparation just open them go

321
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,820
to the marlin section and here one sees

322
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,020
all make these configuration

323
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,930
files and the advanced configuration file

324
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,270
if one wants to take a file already  ready

325
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,330
for your printer just go

326
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,310
to the configurations

327
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,370
config ex samp all 1 as you can see there

328
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,620
are many brands of printers

329
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,050
in this case I randomly own one and

330
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,360
rewind a think rsa and then go to

331
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,630
my folder select all the files the

332
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,850
pairs with did  a magic against the

333
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,530
chip

334
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,069
go back for a moment

335
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,920
they reopen love them in two

336
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,930
marlin

337
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,400
say in the neck he offers me to replace

338
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,180
him I replace them all and we

339
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,570
go back to platform I open

340
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,420
the face open project

341
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,100
a path will appear 4 to follow to

342
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,130
reach my files  so in

343
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,399
this case i know it's matthew they

344
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,279
are in downloaded it could low and the

345
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,170
console otherwise i go crazy again

346
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,290


347
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,990
i know  no in marlin 2

348
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,610
in this case I have to I have to

349
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,170
select the folder where

350
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,320
the platform file is called I point to chini so

351
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,510
this is the folder that interests me about

352
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,560
copi

353
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,120
now we will see which will open the

354
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,620
in this case this question is considered

355
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,120
lite ds trust and auto zza

356
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,190
and we will have our files available

357
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,360
I go to the marlin folder

358
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,710
I will find some configuration files

359
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,839
this is the configuration of our

360
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,510
printer that a person can define as

361
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,160
very good at us we tell you that

362
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,290
we are beginners it is already prepared

363
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,200
and we already know that it works

364
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,730
all we need is to

365
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,860
regularly scroll through the parameters to see

366
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,050
if they satisfy us for example mari one

367
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,110
wants very trivially to change the name

368
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,270
of one's machine there is a way

369
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,670
to do it can love 1 changed the

370
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,990
motherboard so it can go to

371
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,770
define itself  o a very

372
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,420
playful person can there is a

373
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,490
very curious little easter egg that allows you to

374
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,710
enable games you never know 1 st

375
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,330
ahead  the printer wants to waste

376
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,470
time there is nothing better than

377
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,720
playing brics with the screen and

378
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,150
vat that once there is

379
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,950
one who is between networks sure of

380
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,080
his own firmware all he has to do is

381
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,170
press the small icon of the  alien

382
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,210
select your own empire but

383
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,200
individ is written in the

384
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,450
configuration file anyway one so

385
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,190
follow it a bit and know what to do i already know

386
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,000
that from my platform and the

387
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,330
evocative name rambo one from bild the

388
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,740
console

389
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,600
will open now it will probably be produced i

390
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,140
it will change because it was a small file

391
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,300
being prepared

392
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,380
in this case it also tells us

393
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,089
why it doesn't work it tells us that

394
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,240
the vile touch needs a set in

395
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,609
milan stop in birthing in this case

396
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,380
my printer does not require and stop

397
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,390
therefore  I'm going to correct the file

398
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,780
live

399
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,089
everything you

400
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:19,740
figuration age I know that this file

401
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,349
was designed for two printers

402
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,310
at the same time one with and one without

403
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:28,399
and stop I'm going to comment out this line

404
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,440
I'm going back to marlin I'm going to give another

405
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,670
bild now hoping if now sorry

406
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,350
it owes me a moment to download 2

407
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,390
dependencies it will also do it at the beginning as

408
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,980
you can see it has already started compiling and

409
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,800
has already found other errors

410
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,399
because that's okay

411
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,530
ok it's linked  to the nuxe

412
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,100
work permissions there was a

413
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,930
very nice little background that is

414
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,140
because I usually work on windows environment the

415
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,340
windows mind decided not to

416
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,050
work I hastily prepared

417
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,740
this mind in linux environment

418
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,970
this here is definitely a

419
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,520
permissions problem  of the folder that I won't run

420
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,710
now because I'm not very good

421
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,810
in linux

422
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,880
how nice

423
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,750
let's go back for a moment to the presentation

424
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,789
[Music]

425
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,080
as I was saying according to the

426
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,180
printer and the integrated board the film

427
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,790
can be downloaded via usb via

428
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,020
usb or via

429
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,970
programmer loading via  usb connect the

430
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,950
printer to the pc use the

431
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,410
upload command present on platform io and you are

432
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,930
in patient completion  a

433
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,000
loading bar appears the specific tools appear

434
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,490
in for example if one uses

435
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,250
an on board based app it appears

436
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,440
apnea vr are using various a stock exchange

437
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,260
based on stm the

438
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,330
application reagent always appears in serial and then in

439
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,760
serial in the terminal that

440
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,010
know terminals below so you just have to follow it as

441
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,080
before it will tell us both why it works and

442
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,200
why it doesn't work and from there you can act

443
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,160
to correct it

444
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,600
through a gulino tournament program as

445
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,760
before the story gets complicated you have

446
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,550
to

447
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,140
meticulously follow the manuals of your

448
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,420
board

449
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,400
make

450
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,260
connections through  serial or some in

451
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,670
some cases directly to the

452
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,340
memory chip flash very often but the

453
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,810
positive side is that you can load a

454
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,330
bootloader what does it mean that

455
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,580
we will do this complicated procedure only once

456
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,050
after which we will be able to switch to

457
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,480
loading either via usb cable or

458
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,460
via microsd  what is loading

459
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,900
via microsd

460
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,820
the compiled file is reduced to a

461
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,070
file yes  puts in this micro sd it is

462
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,500
sometimes inserted at start up sometimes

463
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,420
by pressing a specific key

464
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,100
on the board the film is

465
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,790
loaded and progresses and that's all

466
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,320
in the end

467
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,420
forgive me for the arrabattato talk but

468
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,040
there was a change of machine  not

469
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,460
foreseen

470
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,880
heavy here I am we are in agreement with

471
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,030
any questions

472
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,799
but you and I will ask you one I

473
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,419
was not so much that you are dealing with

474
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:58,100
3d printing then in the end I made this

475
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,190
progress in a very very fast way

476
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,230
but let's say that living in a very

477
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,419
small municipality during a  lock down period

478
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:07,370
limits you a lot what you can do

479
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,330
so a man a 3d printer a few

480
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,429
things to do that maybe are beyond

481
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:15,500
the fam without those notorious borders

482
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,600
of the various red zones and everything is therefore

483
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,750
one if the mud gets  the and if it does

484
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,790
then maybe it costs how many not and

485
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,940
smiling my first printer was

486
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,519
the three products had for where that

487
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,759
double life for budan therefore made of wood and

488
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,970
that was practically the pales  between

489
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,850
exceptional because it never worked

490
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,080
so you always had to be there to

491
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,509
correct it step by step and

492
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,580
magically it will have every now and then something

493
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,850
comes out luckily no flames well if

494
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,480
this minimum hopefully always we are

495
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,389
fine then questions

496
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:55,820
ask a teacher who does not grant only

497
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,389
one no no then  I have questions I

498
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:02,570
thank you very much dear Matteo for

499
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,519
sharing your experience with us

500
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:10,269
learning about migrants and see you next time
