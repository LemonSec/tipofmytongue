1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,429
good morning everyone

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:04,859
first of all thanks to the organizers

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,940
of bait for hosting us

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,620
the goal of this talk is to

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,280
try to give some visibility to

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,350
the ios operating system the

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,400
mobile operating system based on the android open

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,230
source project

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,490
in particular it is a fork of lines joyce

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,150
and  to give even a little visibility to

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,960
the fondation project because because in

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,300
our opinion it

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,270
represents a real alternative

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,239
to the mobile solutions

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,850
on the market today, i.e. the

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,770
distribution of android distributed by

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,640
anyhow and ios is obviously an ongoing

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,160
project it is certainly not  something

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,559
that can be proposed as a competitor

20
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,570
but today it is a waste that reflects but a real

21
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,210
alternative as you have heard the first

22
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,090
introductory part will be done by marco

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,489
calamari cassandra I think that here, in short,

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,490


25
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,920
people my age have certainly had the opportunity

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,470
to read it for years  on the pages of

27
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,390
punto informatico he

28
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,020
is a person who has always been active on

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,799
what  it's civil rights

30
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,340
on the internet and with projects like

31
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,170
privacy or the winston smith project

32
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,750
it's so i'm my leandro anyway of

33
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,159
computer science die upon completion

34
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,990
different work mainly that

35
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,150
small medium business but i've always been a

36
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,479
supporter of free software

37
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,890
which i send in  mind I use

38
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,560
in my work so now I don't know if

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,570
you want to start your

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,220
marco starting

41
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,470
system with

42
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,630
good morning everyone well all I

43
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,730
'm sorry not to be there with you or

44
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,030


45
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,440
the 2014 shirt establish at least

46
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,320
disenchanted and

47
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,930
perhaps thanks to documentation that I

48
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,020
add some unpublished is a  onesie for

49
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,910
years precisely that I have been dealing with privacy and

50
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,959
I have also had my

51
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,100
information

52
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,340
large companies

53
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,300
[Music]

54
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,680
[Applause] I

55
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,959
have always been involved in information technology that

56
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,620
I had to large

57
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,680
professional training systems or start

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,440
a lansing business that made

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,330
me  naturally led to dealing with the

60
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,739
phone in use

61
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,870
already more than that profile I wonder about the world

62
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,760
says

63
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,950
one  parable on privacy that precisely

64
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,850
from plumbing was a more detail

65
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,290
this year we will have one and

66
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,040
taurasi 1 and 2 october which will never be

67
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,620
tamed yes of relationships not only refereed

68
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,530
smi testimonials tell me about memories

69
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,390
in which you are all invited to participate

70
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,070
at home what  it happened to me in

71
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,750
these 30 years in a nutshell

72
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,159
what is a state of security

73
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,370
evolution the biscione a breakfast the

74
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,430
scenarios because the 90s whoever has

75
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,939
it will remember it was played on a par with

76
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,530
the great great strategists where

77
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,120
one could have a  and they come back born

78
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,239
absolute with a bit of self-discipline

79
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,049
in the following decade

80
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:55,310
2010 what they started to

81
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,620
change therefore mounted bis time and

82
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,159
therefore a lot of services were born

83
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,170
in

84
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,849
2010 2020 and smartphones have

85
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,769
become useless therefore from

86
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,939
everyone's pockets and mary only show  have increased

87
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:11,500
adopted

88
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,239
household habits hours 20 in

89
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,298
my opinion minute 20 all and have

90
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,810
produced the two great evils of

91
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,050
society order is  a disability from aids can

92
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,780
no longer be fought

93
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,750
on a par with the big brains it is

94
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,430
necessary to pass a strategy of

95
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,710
imitation of the damage that is to play

96
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,050
this lesser animal here on a personal level

97
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,930
and to draw lots for the two

98
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,760
great evils threats

99
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,460
serious problems in progress that concern us

100
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,289
more or less all i.e. social

101
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,349
smartphones are two great things to

102
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:54,229
talk about there are different strategies so

103
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,900
let's talk about social but the strategy

104
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,520
the imitation we have now let's

105
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,070
get out of it

106
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,240
in a smart and

107
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:09,979


108
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,780
social way theoretically could not decide

109
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,310
there are those who have it  done I did it too

110
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,380
for a certain period of pendulum

111
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,169
smartphones big pot raiola yes but half

112
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:24,509
from budan phone those who still come for

113
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,300
20 euros and who make phone calls and I

114
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,389
received a text message and always without

115
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:33,030
operating systems they can't do any more

116
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,400
damage

117
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,430
and started at that it is clear that if

118
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,520
i can only call and i lose my age it is

119
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,650
social that we talk do not call

120
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,510
so on the chat it is incredibly  you

121
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,139
too lucky limited

122
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,690
human developed and therefore approved mobile phones

123
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,000
immediately touch what it meant

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,060
in terms of interaction with others

125
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,270
interesting the mafias with others

126
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,070
what it meant is that I

127
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,680
put it a big damage that on the other

128
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,760
side of the  balance respect respect

129
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,630
and it occurred to me to

130
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,419
promptly go back to the relative mobile from a

131
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,030
new mobile one often to the new and

132
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,780
began to implement on the smartphone

133
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,699
harm reduction is completely the

134
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,300
milans that

135
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,870
developed me

136
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,419
been in the past a movie with me so

137
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,110
past that  mini froome still burn

138
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,330
and so i had to study a

139
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,240
bit i did the cue of the beginning of

140
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,819
activity as with tutor france

141
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,590
the computer process i don't know more

142
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,539
just the influence because the relationship

143
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,689
only actress to the computer smartphone and

144
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:01,500
of 9 the  90 percent of the time what

145
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,449
I had to do something and analyze

146
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,699
a smartphone that I did a crash

147
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,870
practical course even if v  seen from

148
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,280
a somewhat peculiar perspective on

149
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,800
smartphones I realized a few

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,930
things that are not maybe become not

151
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,860
only fact that

152
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,139
much wittier colleague spoke about

153
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,139
it he will lose in the future of those from us he

154
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,599
will certainly be an adult interested

155
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,300
but coming to us that  thing what you

156
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,539
can finally start installing the

157
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:34,650
possible applications

158
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,199
dinho can apply the

159
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,620
installed possibly that they

160
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,110
should be he did it look

161
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,759
and you have to give him minutes

162
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,060
and mission possible that not only those

163
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,629
are not what is

164
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:56,629
good

165
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,099
my

166
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,160
need always

167
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,970
now they tell me

168
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,759
talking about history there is always the lume

169
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,630
feedback so I would say that

170
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,849
could 3 mine

171
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:40,589
problems that can further

172
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:42,880
lower enough in fact di milic not even

173
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,529
a veil better but I'm still

174
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,860
hair better even

175
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,810
before you hear me I can lower then

176
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,930
maybe

177
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,529
arched personal data more perfect

178
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:03,110
very well  I apologize then

179
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,980
radiation donated to makeshift accommodation

180
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,050


181
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,899
is  we were saying that the normal normal

182
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,640
ways to reduce damage

183
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,490
i.e. few applications remove as much

184
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,920
permissions as possible from

185
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,910
bonds are certainly a way to reduce

186
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,060
damage but it is not a very effective way

187
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,820
because it requires continuous no

188
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,160
continuous application a lot of time

189
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,750
in the summer under what phone  with all

190
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,010
indeed this obviously nobody's

191
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,209
and above all it does not eliminate the damage given

192
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,640
to the non-applications that

193
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,520
android phones is my case they are on

194
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,680
about eighty percent of the

195
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,740
existing phones in the world and they have a lot of

196
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,810
unusual things from the minute that  they stay in the

197
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,440
background and do things without there

198
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,320


199
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,660
being an application installed they are almost

200
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,970
all in the play service which in fact are

201
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,250
absolutely impossible to install

202
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,130
and in the 28 google applications that

203
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,970
we use without but all announced by

204
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,870
google maps the cfc voice assistant is

205
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,420
that therefore it is also necessary to make another

206
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,960
gas and there are other steps

207
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,270
here too, I do a bit of drug dealing  a flashback

208
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,040
and I'll go back

209
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,810
there are phones that don't have

210
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,240
android and they don't have indeed they are very

211
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,780
old the progenitor

212
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,810
that the free runner of open moto was a

213
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,600
linux phone on which they downloaded a

214
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,960
customized linux distribution and they

215
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,790
tried to make things work and make them

216
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,680
work  things mean that if he were

217
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,420
able to call with both of

218
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,970
us hearing and if he knows how to send us an sms

219
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,880
and this is already difficult for the well-known

220
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,610
reasons of complete closure of the bees

221
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,330
and chipsets that telephones make and

222
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,760
continue to be even now so

223
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,280
after having bought a randomly

224
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,350
known tool and having wasted a

225
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,780
considerable amount of time trying to use it

226
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,420
at least to make calls, promised it is only

227
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,760
in the scarcity of things too beautiful

228
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,860
to be thrown away and he still

229
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,710
succeeds with a lot of paul c  'there's been

230
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,500
a lot of activity a lot of companies have been

231
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,050
producing since we're talking about

232
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,570
the late 90's since then they've been

233
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,420
producing

234
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,920
show phones for the most part

235
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,400
limits inside but they have always been weather

236
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,470
and commercial initiatives and have

237
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,800
never had a minimum of diffusion

238
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,110
lately the two phones referred to

239
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,540
are

240
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,320
the file with the phone problem which are

241
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,300
two

242
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,530
implementations the second in free

243
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,470
of the first of a mobile phone answer

244
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,210
distributions that begin to do

245
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,340
what they have to for the

246
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,180
main performance call sms little else but

247
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,820
they are not usable as a replacement for the

248
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,680
phone we if we want to limit the

249
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,240
damage we have to move in the real world

250
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,250
a world voice bottle that i with

251
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,010
limited space these are

252
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,110
delimited where to put  in

253
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,970
most people's pockets a phone

254
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,770
that does at least the essential things

255
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,680
today we are used to not making calls and

256
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,880
sending text messages but seeing total maps

257
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,580


258
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,980
this is possible because in reality

259
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,970
various folks and androids are satisfied that

260
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,330
derivative linux created by google and then

261
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,089
leaves  I have to leave it if I don't know if it is

262
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:47,540
open in pure form without services

263
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,240
add-ons without strings installed

264
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,190
programmatically sure that

265
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,260
this whole process is put into producing a

266
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,839
binary distribution let's believe

267
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,690
there have been several before the last one

268
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,350
we'll talk about

269
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,880
someone defines software distributions

270
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,420
to save on the phone

271
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,339
if we talk about software for  the

272
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,470
phone we talk about rome we are talking about the

273
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,910
same rope from the point of view of a

274
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,800
software to reverse view but the object

275
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,570
is the same so try to make

276
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,230
this interchange

277
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,610
let's get back to us and

278
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,500
if the bull must be this an

279
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,410
initiative like that of limes  and

280
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,260
precisely produces a clean stop android

281
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,589
without anything concerning google play

282
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:39,230
serve only it is an excellent initiative

283
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,980
that stalls in a single hit

284
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,750
any phone of the many supported by me

285
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,060
that have where the

286
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,700
complete environment and I immediately have an

287
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,100
operational phone that the  phone texting

288
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,200
also does a few other extremely

289
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,209
simple things that i can install

290
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:57,700
apps on  no

291
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,190
applications without a market without a

292
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,970
store

293
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,770
I can install them on from thinking about it by

294
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,950
uploading them by titling them by

295
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,309
uploading them to mine it's not something it's

296
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:11,290
easy but it's not a very simple thing

297
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,119
to manage between joyfully and

298
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,519
whatever else has been mentioned nor step

299
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,439
forward because actually  a

300
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,199
functioning smartphone could be

301
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:22,720
bought at prices quite similar to

302
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,509
that of a smartphone hunt start

303
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:26,889
work however they are not enough because in the

304
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:30,929
absence of studies in the absence of a

305
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:34,839
comfortable rob installed that would make the

306
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,179
smartphone at least similar to an

307
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:40,629
animal smartphone did not exist

308
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,860
and on this  sublime joe s building on

309
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,660
garages the

310
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,569
e foundation of turin initiative was created le not an

311
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:52,179
operating system those giardinese but a

312
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:54,420
complete distribution

313
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,920
will be a small software ecosystem that

314
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,959
starting from the beginning s

315
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,420
builds something that from the point

316
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,129
of view of services  of functioning

317
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:06,279
as a normal profession was a

318
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,679
cell phone smartphone and how  this was

319
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,899
achieved by creating a story from

320
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:13,569
everything because he knows things but said

321
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:15,490
in terms he really is documentaries and

322
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,740
I hope I don't trivialize too much with

323
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,929
the cars he corrected not you his

324
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:21,059
disposition

325
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:23,980
a micro service was created it's

326
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,139
called mythology and it does  essentially

327
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:29,649
ended up with the applications being

328
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:32,049
google places

329
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:34,379
and then

330
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:37,990
providing the application with a service

331
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,249
similar to google free or e ak

332
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:44,410
excuses like no right now we're

333
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,329
off i can't give it to you etc

334
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:47,920
etc in order to still

335
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,319
make the protections work  this event

336
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:51,819
possible to install

337
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:55,420
android applications not much of the ways

338
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,670
the android application and to make them

339
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,949
work with limited efforts

340
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:02,529
especially if one goes the law what has

341
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,360
not been the reception successfully

342
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,079
but not enough a store is also provided

343
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,780
and it is not the  usual est

344
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,580
that we all know that allows you to

345
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,890
install free applications from

346
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,190
a real market brands from t  utor

347
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,130
say free and obviously

348
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,140
but he installed another one derived from

349
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,080
another market on which he will tell

350
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,080
that he had the road that to all

351
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,740
intents and purposes appears as a market like the

352
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,930
google play store in the second then

353
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,150
install the applications you will find a

354
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,170
good part of the

355
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,920
commercial and functioning applications and you can

356
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,110
download the most varied things from it I

357
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,720


358
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,840
easily found

359
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,150
sites to use the identity card as a

360
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:55,870
token there I found my bank's

361
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,960
for they were able to use

362
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,520
my bank's types it was given the

363
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,270
most normal applications

364
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,940
if functioning installed in the middle of a

365
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,500
stop that this is a big step forward

366
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,810
for selling the phone actually

367
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,599
insertable in the pocket of the enemy's aunt

368
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,000
with that dealing with the computer or

369
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,920
even the med who would have time to

370
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,349
deal with

371
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,170
badly want to spend the tricolor fish

372
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,359
I must say that  basically I managed to

373
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,900
finally create reason for the dream of

374
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,320
having a well used object a

375
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,290
ragi object  honestly leader

376
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,090
probably respectful of my privacy

377
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,910
not concretely the which reduces a

378
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,610
lot and damage without spending

379
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,190
too much time and without spending too much money

380
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,610
this difficult goal and foundation

381
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,360
has among its many merits on which

382
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,000
apologies at length to that of having

383
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,370
been the first to put them in  able me and

384
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,530
I hope with many other people to

385
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,840
carry out this operation with a few

386
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,540
hundred euros and a couple of days

387
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,150
of work that could have been done

388
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,560
better sergio the funds that

389
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,120
are there understood

390
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,030
this to tell you that my intervention

391
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,270
which was only intended to

392
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,680
illustrate a  personal perspective on

393
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,350
what are huge privacy today 10

394
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,260
to 20 not thirty years ago fully

395
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,420
studied and tackled a sauce of

396
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,800
industries because here you see

397
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,350
even if it looks like a brick just

398
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,650
like other bricks

399
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,090
this is a phone that contains

400
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,850
a dozen applications

401
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,930
upload and by the way a film so if

402
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,610
you are sensitive to

403
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,790
ecol issues  logic more materials is a phone

404
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,040
that costs a little more for the same

405
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,570
performance than a normal phone is

406
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,200
repairable made with

407
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,690
materials mostly obtained from sources respectful

408
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,880
of people's pros is more than anything

409
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,920
can be fixed with a single

410
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,890
screwdriver disassembles completely  you

411
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,720
can change the pieces with large

412
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,640
pieces they cost him you can

413
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,120
upgrade the walls when they come out then

414
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,890
later electric you can change the

415
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,840
camera the previous model as

416
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,970
there is the camera of the

417
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,240
current model which is more three soldiers they are not

418
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,300
all of them are flowers and clear that not

419
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,910
all sims and applications that then

420
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,250
turned around but there were for

421
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,080
example the boscolo of e foundation

422
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,970
allows you to request if an application is missing

423
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,250
to request it I

424
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,050
did it twice and within a few

425
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,160
days these applications are

426
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,280
buying

427
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,720
the  operation of the e

428
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,150
foundation store a complex topic

429
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,270
was detected channel wind i believe

430
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,750
it had oc  the time wasted for me code

431
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,960
their base I just wanted to get

432
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,650
this message across it can be done

433
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,480
it can't be done without particular

434
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,880
android development skills on

435
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,060
tim mobiles in fact I didn't have

436
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,100
and I'm glad I did and if you

437
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,170
use meters I'm in this situation  the

438
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,540
old cellphone on my desk

439
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,470
without sim turned on so many times i had to

440
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,910
find a demo netti

441
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,130
application but it happened once

442
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,860
luca nemoli signs like the realm of

443
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,630
security on the desk without

444
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,210
portable behind

445
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,530
so many times i had to do

446
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,600
something i forgot puts us at  chin

447
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,210
partivo's sim unusual

448
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,200
polluted environment of google this happened to me

449
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,080
once in a month and i could have done

450
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,730
without it it wasn't an

451
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,190
emergency this is another

452
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,470
important story because it's important how

453
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,330
to exit initialize a phone but

454
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,730
get  in your pocket affect that you are

455
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,010
substantially more

456
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,540
class-friendly you can obviously do by quoting in

457
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,550
que  this news and thanks to marco for the

458
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,950
introduction

459
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,920
I wanted to start first with a short

460
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,690
survey since in short we are

461
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,750
not even a few today to understand how many of

462
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,300
you have used so I didn't try to

463
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,450
install I played but used a

464
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,220
mobile phone as an aroma

465
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,760
I bet leandro  now

466
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,929
it goes

467
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:28,779
ok I don't see hands raised so it means

468
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:30,600
that here at

469
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,480
12 ok 3 well

470
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,500
ok anyway here we will be

471
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,980
three people

472
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,740
we feel like marco you know

473
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,990
yes we feel like him too you know about cristiano

474
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,020
ok the other question was how many of those

475
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,340
who used a custom rom

476
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,110
they used as their

477
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,300
main phone i.e. the phone they

478
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,370
answer when he called from his number

479
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,670
horca myseria ok those of four out of

480
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,520
four good let's say that to date but

481
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,010
in principle

482
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,590
even if we use a custom rom it

483
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:23,030
is difficult for this to be

484
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,560
our first phone  the one where we

485
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,570
save our contacts where maybe

486
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,640
we have our calendar etc. I'll

487
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,810
add a question I didn't have before

488
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,250
this since I didn't expect that

489
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,160
all used as your first phone do

490
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,370
you have google applications or that are

491
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,740
based on google

492
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,970
ok ok ok ok 4 out of 4 we didn't get

493
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,990
the good one, in short, we are desks, in short,

494
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,820
ok, this

495
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,160
is where this talk comes from, so I'm

496
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,809
precise and not  just an

497
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:56,280
android developer i'm not even particularly

498
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,850
fond of telephony no

499
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,260
confirming what marco said that you don't

500
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,600
need to be an

501
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,740
android geek to approach ios however i am

502
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,620
a person who has always had

503
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,200
the issues of free software and

504
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,380
privacy at heart  and if on these fronts,

505
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,360
in short, the best minds have kept the results over the years

506
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,730
the fact that

507
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,110
many public administrations

508
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,059
have also adopted

509
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,710
free software is certainly because

510
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,840
administrations like this like

511
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,530
google dei a lot of work has been done in

512
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,520
other situations we will perhaps never see

513
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,660
get results so maybe the have

514
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,110
of linux on desktop is destined not to

515
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,320
arrive but the cos  what I think we can

516
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,590
see is that for some time now

517
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,480
most of the interactions with the web

518
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,510
have moved to the mobile so

519
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,420
most people use the

520
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,340
mobile phone to connect to the internet

521
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,390
and if in the future it is possible that we can

522
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,150
meet a person without a  pc very

523
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,070
difficult we will find a person who

524
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,800
does not know that he does not have a smartphone

525
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,140
and the question is that on linux and school

526
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,080
on mobile linux is already present it

527
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,640
has always been present therefore linux

528
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,850
mobile is actually also open source because the

529
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,029
basis of the open operating system  source

530
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:22,309
but how is it that this thing is not done

531
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:24,679
we are not pleased because obviously we know

532
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:27,379
very well that inside these

533
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:29,929
mobile phones there is a large layer of

534
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:33,409
closed software of google software in

535
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:37,869
particular the google play services which

536
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:40,700
we say is the basis  indispensable not

537
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,999
only for

538
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:45,830
google applications but also for a whole series

539
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,700
of apps that count on this

540
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,570
software to be able to work

541
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,130
here

542
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,780
now of the custom roms here I

543
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,690
also caught four of those who

544
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,630
use it well but in short I think I'm not

545
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,270
wrong and linux on the desktop

546
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,310
we have not yet reached but

547
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,050
we all normally use linux on the

548
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,060
desktop

549
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,850
the custom roms on the mobile or a

550
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,190
completely open mobile still the

551
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,870
most of us don't have it

552
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,490
even though maybe we are in a context

553
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,740
where the skills to be able to do it

554
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,900
should be there let alone if

555
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,540
we can think that a normal user

556
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,040
can choose to get a

557
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,630
mobile phone that is not with android

558
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,250
with google installed as his first

559
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,010
phone  then we have these which

560
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,290
could be the characteristics that

561
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,400
a device must have in order to

562
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,670
be our main device

563
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,350
we have identified fat and functioning among the factors

564
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,880
which may seem

565
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,420
a bit paradoxical but in reality who has

566
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,130
had to deal with the  rom custom knows

567
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,890
that this one is not a foregone conclusion to

568
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,450
make the gps work some time ago

569
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,960
also i  wireless it is clear that if one

570
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,420
wants to think of adopting a mobile phone

571
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,010
as the first mobile phone the hardware

572
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,450
must work everything must work

573
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,370
let's say first the availability of the

574
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,860
most popular apps in the sense that maybe even

575
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,409
we who are a little more sensitive to

576
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:21,899
privacy issues or  work or

577
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:23,929
because in any case we have to know

578
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:26,600
applications such as whatsapp

579
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,919
facebook instagram we find ourselves

580
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,330
having installed in the question I

581
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,610
asked earlier all four of those who in

582
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,559
any case have their first mobile phone or

583
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,899
a custom rom use applications

584
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:40,139
that rely on the

585
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:41,029
google

586
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:43,350
pd software we must expect  that the mobile phone

587
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,119
allows us to do this with a certain

588
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,039
ease

589
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:49,409
and the other part is the integration with a

590
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:52,320
cloud platform in the sense that by now we

591
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,190
are used to that when we buy a

592
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,740
new mobile phone we

593
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,090
install and configure our

594
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,769
account because it is essential if

595
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:04,049
we want to install  applications and

596
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:06,720
in fact very generously  google

597
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,749
gives us an e-mail box

598
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:11,159
it allows us to copy

599
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,769
our contacts on their platform it's

600
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:15,629
like this for the calendar it's like this for

601
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:18,179
photos then if we take the mobile phone

602
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,740
we have a backup and we can

603
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,929
restore it if we change mobile

604
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:23,789
we take a new one  we enter the account

605
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:26,530
and we find everything

606
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,680
synchronized, that condition is created

607
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,610
which is commonly

608
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,070
called the garden role where

609
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,900
basically we are so used

610
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,380
to some comforts that even if

611
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,570
we know that perhaps the operating system

612
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,940
is

613
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,140
quite intrusive we make it

614
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,010
go well because it is  hard to

615
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,110
give up these services here so

616
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,910
the fact that there may be a

617
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,770
cloud platform that allows us to

618
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,710
have the same community that

619
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,580
google or apple gives us is definitely one of

620
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,520
those features that we require a

621
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,050
phone to be our main phone

622
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,649


623
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,120
because they are interesting  fondation

624
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,279
something I also told you marco to say

625
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,080
add  meanwhile it is a

626
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,870
foundation it is not a company it is

627
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,059
a non-profit association founded by the

628
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:22,179
creator of mandrake and the linux distro

629
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:25,630
obviously he is not a wizard and therefore a

630
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,730
person who has already had the opportunity

631
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,429
to demonstrate that he knows how to manage with

632
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:34,299
complex companies have also been successful and

633
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:37,150
another thing that I think is quite

634
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,919
interesting is that it is

635
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:41,289
openly privacy-centric

636
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:43,600
if we look at the homepages the

637
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,820
company's claim your data is your data

638
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,169
this is a clear

639
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:53,710
market positioning and we know that when a reality

640
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,090
is positioned on a particular object

641
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,260
in this case privacy going to

642
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,570
incriminate or make a mistake on that thing

643
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,880
means making the project fail therefore

644
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,669
in our opinion the fact that they are

645
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:11,770
openly intertwined with the

646
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,620
fact of guaranteeing privacy is a

647
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,090
positive side of the project and  then the other thing

648
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,460
provides those three things we were saying

649
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,370
before, i.e. the possibility of having a

650
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,640
telephone that saves me from having to give myself

651
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,679
e-mails.  being capable of installing a rom I go

652
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,500
to the site and it is the purchase

653
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,299
it gives me an app store that allows me to

654
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:36,190
ask for the installation of an app and

655
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,350
have the most installed and it provides me with

656
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,580
a cloud infrastructure for which I

657
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,380
enter my cloud account

658
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,649
myself  my pickled data also on their

659
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:45,750
servers

660
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,480
we can say that the user experience

661
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,520
within a fondation mobile phone

662
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,370
is substantially the same as the

663
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,070
one we have with smartphones

664
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,980
google wiphone

665
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,570
obviously I repeat now here we are

666
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:06,700
going to highlight the parts and good

667
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,290
we know very well in short  that these

668
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,030
projects

669
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,990
may not work one hundred

670
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,520
percent there are still some things that

671
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,429
need to be fixed but the reason that

672
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:18,220
also prompted us to give visibility is that

673
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,440
we see when we try you and what

674
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,150
we can see how it works is

675
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,410
really really easy and linear

676
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,910
we have some  on the slightly more

677
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,640
technical part what does it mean I have to use

678
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,910
a

679
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,100
smartphone we know well that on top of

680
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,370
android open source  that is, the layer of

681
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,809
software that we identify with the

682
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:43,870
google play service all

683
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,850
google apps make use of this software

684
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,220
but also a good part

685
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,730
of third-party applications

686
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,020
include in the sources the client library

687
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,450
that interfaces with google play

688
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,390
service for just to name one  above

689
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,580
all and signal despite the fact that

690
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,620
the application is one of the applications

691
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,860
that makes security its

692
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,470
focal point includes the client library

693
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,380
three-sided well igoogle play service basically does it

694
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,720
only to solve

695
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,610
push notifications because otherwise if

696
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,770
you choose to install the version that

697
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,080
does not include  the library to receive

698
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,570
notifications you have to open signal or in

699
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,760
any case keep it always open but in

700
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,590
fact also the applications that we

701
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,910
are used to framing as

702
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,480
secure applications

703
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,330
make use of the software layer that

704
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,790
derives from google so I have to use

705
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,900
a smartphone basically

706
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,520
means to replace that layer  of

707
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,580
google software  and play service of with

708
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,620
another software

709
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,480
in this case the software in question

710
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,530
is micro jim mickle g basically it

711
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,559
is able in a nutshell

712
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,559
to respond to all the api requests and/

713
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,720
or all the interactions that the

714
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,299
software can do anyway like this layer

715
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:03,799
of  google software like google for

716
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:04,750
services

717
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,419
how the ac does it in this case it's the

718
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:10,669
secret spoofing what happens to the

719
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:12,130
applications

720
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,450
before interfacing with the google

721
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,880
play services and not all but

722
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,950
most do the verification of the

723
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,890
digital signature to ensure originality

724
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,470
of the google play service

725
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,630
the problem is that obviously micro g doesn't

726
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,460
have the google private key and therefore

727
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,630
can't generate a certificate

728
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,049
that is either original

729
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:38,840
how can you get around this well the

730
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,270
verification is definitely not done

731
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,780
by the application it's

732
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,429
not that  each application has in

733
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:45,530
its sources the code to

734
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,990
verify the digital signature makes a

735
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,000
call to the operating system

736
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,740
obviously the underlying operating system

737
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,110
implements the

738
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,150
green light signature spoofing and says don't worry,

739
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,030
talk to him interact with the software

740
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,360
because it's google play service

741
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,179
this is

742
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:07,160
we'll leave it there but obviously if

743
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,330
you go to inform yourself around

744
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,980
not everyone is

745
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,170
favorable favors  to the implementation

746
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,820
of signature spoofing in the operating system

747
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,670
because because in theory

748
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,330
when any app is present it

749
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,320
could pass itself off as

750
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,200
another app and this would obviously be

751
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,090
a security exposure

752
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,850
in reality ineos which obviously already

753
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,280
comes out is already distributed with  mike it

754
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,190
is understood there is nothing to do the

755
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,410
sigma to school finger is active only at the

756
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:41,520
level of some and some applications

757
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,380
at the operating system level therefore

758
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,140
there is no userspace it is not possible to do

759
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,970
the secret spoofing there is no way for

760
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:50,310
an application to succeed  to install

761
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,930
expecting that in another so it's

762
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,360
all caged at an operating system level

763
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,120
o and checked cir built

764
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,660
only those parts that

765
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,980
allowed the book to use the phone

766
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,990
then we talked about the apps of the apps that

767
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,918
work here try to show him the

768
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,679
phone

769
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:16,730
this is jos

770
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:19,980
this is the app store you are

771
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,250
facing

772
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,590
ok

773
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,750
ok

774
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,899
let's try to search  some applications

775
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,859
let's go with those of google

776
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,880
and youtube it is ready to install

777
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,149
whatsapp

778
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:46,129
and it is ready to install

779
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:47,540
you will see that all the applications that

780
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,000
we are used to using are already

781
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,129
here, ready to be installed and

782
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:54,679
used, which I had already prepared for

783
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:58,300
the municipality there  it's facebook etc.

784
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,450
ok and this is definitely not something

785
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,300
that takes for granted for those who, as I said before,

786
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,589
have used custom roms

787
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,890
what's the question how that has a bit of

788
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,560
a

789
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,880
dull point in this system

790
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:22,839
josé's app store

791
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:24,940
declares to

792
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,310
download applications from the service

793
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,430
that tassels that the dot org

794
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,359
genetics the dot organ

795
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:34,609
interesting service because in any case it says that

796
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:37,300
in the applications that it approves

797
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,330
a checks the digital certificate and

798
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,089
then verifies that they are original the

799
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:46,280
bluff a check a check with the

800
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,830
exodus privacy service to

801
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,660
verify that there are no trackers if

802
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,420
we take a moment off the phone and

803
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,500
open an application

804
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,900
you see here that in addition to the

805
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,819
user rating  there is also a privacy rating of

806
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:08,900
8 out of 10 which means that the application

807
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,720
contains something that sends data to

808
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,880
someone else android layer applications

809
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,339
normally have a rating of

810
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,839
ten out of ten

811
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,819
obviously this is already a useful thing

812
00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:22,920
because it also allows us  without going to

813
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,970
look for information on the application

814
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,029
to get an idea of ​​how intrusive it can be

815
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:30,450
is the rank of

816
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,910
open source applications boys 13 out of 10 to 9 out of 10

817
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,819
because in short they are

818
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:37,440
included when open applications are

819
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,819
developed with platforms that

820
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:40,079
have the possibility  to report

821
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,029
any errors and the developers

822
00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:44,369
have inserted three cards but only three

823
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,200
carbons but it is right for d  give you

824
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,990
the information in the extreme case to

825
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,579
look for an application that you consider

826
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,099
safe and you don't find now even ten

827
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:53,990
out of ten

828
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,760
let's go back to the clean up x.org speech

829
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,710
so let's say it provides an excellent service

830
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,079
because we said it provides us with

831
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,160
all the applications we

832
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,650
need there are  additional services because it

833
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,240
checks that they are original because it

834
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,119
checks that there are no trackers

835
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:10,170
as marco said it is even

836
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,150
possible to request an application from the mobile phone

837
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,190
if we cannot find it times

838
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,750
also seem to be quick enough

839
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,579
to find it present in the app store

840
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,619
however it also tells us that the

841
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:23,730
open applications it takes from ex droid it does not tell us

842
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,010
where the other applications and other apis arrive, however,

843
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,859
which of

844
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:31,230
course when a company presents itself

845
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,589
as a supporter

846
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:37,529
of privacy it is easy for the

847
00:37:37,529 --> 00:37:40,410
forums to be populated by people who are

848
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,089
particularly sensitive to issues

849
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:43,600
of  privacy

850
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,550
in fact if you take a look you will

851
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,700
find above all a thread where they are

852
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,400
quite harsh on this point

853
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,270
against fondation

854
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,830
, in the end after long

855
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,170
discussions a faq was generated where basically

856
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,930
the bunds and shawn says that she

857
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,760
periodically receives

858
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,280
collaboration proposals that it seemed to him that the

859
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,800
picai dot org climate proposal was

860
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,870
the valid proposal  who have been

861
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,730
using it for several years who are

862
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,650
also inviting users to report

863
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,750
any problems and that to date

864
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,480
there are no problems so this is

865
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,730
what we have to stop at of the

866
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,230
conjectures that have obviously been made it

867
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:27,360
is that behind

868
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,910
the cloud applications there are  other

869
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,910
app stores such as

870
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:37,150
aurora who mentioned marco or ap chi

871
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,040
although

872
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,780
it is another store that basically

873
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,150
sums up gateways to google play and

874
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,160
aurora sine install it open ask

875
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,170
just connect to google play with your

876
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,330
account or anonymously if you choose

877
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,670
anonymous way they use a  their account and all

878
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,320
they do is tell you what application

879
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,940
you want they fish it from google  plate they

880
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,110
return it and then in the

881
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,240
operating system you do what you want so it

882
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,780
is easy to understand that behind

883
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,610
the clean up cloud applications

884
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,170
there may be one of

885
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,240
these stores with the problem of these

886
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,030
stores that there are those who raise  doubts

887
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,190
that they are

888
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,630
legal on the fact that they can do this

889
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,960
thing

890
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,730
and here one could make a huge conjecture

891
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,300
that therefore clean up and point org could

892
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,670
be a ploy made to

893
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,290
protect themselves in the event that tomorrow morning

894
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:27,290
google wakes up and wants to be a

895
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,760
propose boxes from the  legal point of view

896
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,510


897
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,000
repeats it these are conjectures to date

898
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,510
we stop at the fact that we have the

899
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,980
availability of all the applications

900
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,200
that in most of the

901
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,270
applications we need that are

902
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,190
installed with a click and that the

903
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,770
open ones come from freud and this is

904
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:48,070
all we can say

905
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:51,490
so then the problem arises

906
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,250
of saying or an application and klose let's

907
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,770
install whatsapp I made a

908
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,869
phone  or some bugs and now

909
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:01,880
an application that in any case does its

910
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,369
good job of profiling sends to

911
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:07,450
my contacts sends to my photos it's a

912
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:10,540
pity because it would be nice to be able to

913
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,670
limit this annoyance a bit it is

914
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,300
also possible to do this because

915
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,400
when companies have had  the need

916
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,089
to deliver to your employees with

917
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:24,890
a mobile phone just to prevent them

918
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,420
from forgetting their home when they were out and about

919
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,710
fatality that of the company

920
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:32,710
was developed what is called

921
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,869
work profile and essentially it

922
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:36,940
is a sandbox within the

923
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,309
operating system where  the company can install

924
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:42,130
the company applications

925
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,450
the data the contacts in the company address book the

926
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,239
company files and keep

927
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:48,190
completely separate from the personal ones

928
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,039
therefore basically a user can

929
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:53,640
have his contacts his family members

930
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,619
his vacation photos on his

931
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:59,739
personal profile and instead have those  which

932
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:02,499
are company data company documents

933
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:06,029
and company contacts on work profile

934
00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:08,829
shelte  r is a software that takes advantage of

935
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:11,470
this feature I don't know if it

936
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,619
can be seen here no

937
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:16,900
we are on the phone

938
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,880
I have already installed it for convenience and

939
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,440
for even times

940
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,660
we can see it from here

941
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,220
basically shelter shows the apps

942
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,369
installed in the main profile and then

943
00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:32,890
tells you that you can  clone them on shelter

944
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,799
essentially in workgroups what

945
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:37,660
you can do in fact is to

946
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,119
select an application and click

947
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:43,089
on ready shelter to find yourself with

948
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:44,529
the application installed in the work

949
00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:49,440
profile one thing I didn't tell you

950
00:41:49,749 --> 00:41:52,499
sorry for a moment

951
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,170
when we go up shelter we see that

952
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,789
by default

953
00:41:57,789 --> 00:41:59,980
we already have

954
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,019
the contacts file and micro g installed in the work profile

955
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:08,369
if we go to see the applications on

956
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:12,009
the desktop of the mobile phone we see that

957
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:13,960
we have a contact icon with a

958
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,789
padlock and it does not remember a file with a

959
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:18,069
padlock while we have another one that

960
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,559
i'm who are the ones by default

961
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:22,210
proving they are separate moments

962
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,819
i had created contacts in my

963
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:28,089
profile when installing  to shelter the

964
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:30,549
contacts on the web profile are empty

965
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,410
so when on this it means that

966
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,329


967
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:36,519
even if they access the

968
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:38,859
contacts, all the applications installed in the work profiles will access the contacts that we

969
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:41,300
decide to insert here

970
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,910
the standard modus operandi for those who

971
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,130
use shelter is to insert

972
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,960
on the contacts  that he needs and

973
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,340
possibly obviously cleaning up additional data by

974
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,090
leaving the

975
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,040
telephone number and perhaps a nickname so

976
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,740
that even if the data is sent,

977
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,660
the use that can be made is

978
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,700
substantially limited

979
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,960
the last suggestion I give you in

980
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,070
relation to shelter

981
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:10,540
is that  not to clone the applications

982
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,850
as I showed before

983
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:18,250
ok but to clone the app store directly on shelter

984
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,410


985
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,660
and then

986
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,110
possibly install applications

987
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:29,720
from the cloned app store on shelter so

988
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,069
if I want to install whatsapp

989
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,010
this is their success and this instance of

990
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,080
whatsapp

991
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,960
will have access  only to the work

992
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,570
profile boxes and the applications and data

993
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,730
that are installed there  there are

994
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,410
that this already represents the

995
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,110
possibility of saying

996
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:56,920
either a phone where or

997
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,050
the applications I need but the

998
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,030
applications I need I have had the

999
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,760
possibility of relegating them to a context

1000
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,310
where I have more control over the data they

1001
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:10,030
can read

1002
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:14,180
ok let's see what comes  after the part of the

1003
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,000
cloud that came first as an

1004
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,110
important part

1005
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:23,480
to have a phone a smartphone

1006
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,300
as the main phone

1007
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,150
the foundation makes its own

1008
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,550
infrastructure available and if we go to

1009
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,920
the account section of the phone

1010
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,630
we have the option of entering a

1011
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,760
google account this  it means that if

1012
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,920
we already have a google account on our

1013
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,990
current phone we can

1014
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,680
configure the

1015
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,820
username and password profile of our google account here

1016
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,040
and see our

1017
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,050
contacts, our files and our photos synchronized on the

1018
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:54,080
foundation mobile obviously

1019
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,960
this is not the optimal result and

1020
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,330
therefore a  alternative solutions to

1021
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,800
that, for example, of registering an

1022
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,320
acc  ount on the fondation cloud and

1023
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,940
keep the data on this cloud

1024
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,380
obviously the functions are the

1025
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,110
same when I enter an account

1026
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,810
in the address book this venera tuned

1027
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:17,540
to the fondation cloud so for the photos

1028
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,910
for the calendar etc. another thing

1029
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,040
that is very interesting  that I

1030
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,620
can do this since

1031
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,960
standard protocols of card

1032
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,870
hard caldav are used use a web account

1033
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,970
from I personally use a

1034
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:34,430
zimbra platform in my mobile phone

1035
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,920
so we will always have used both as

1036
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,300
e-mail but also for

1037
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,080
calendar management etc.

1038
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,980
the zimbra platform I have  entered my

1039
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:46,500
account as soon as possible and I

1040
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,270
found myself with the mobile phone that was already in

1041
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,010
place ready for use

1042
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,750
marco earlier spoke of maybe two days

1043
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,120
to fix the mobile phone

1044
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,790
I must say that my experience

1045
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:00,030
was that of a couple of  hours to have

1046
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,850
the mobile phone up and running

1047
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:06,410
and I don't know how we are with the times

1048
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,140
I'll show you

1049
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:13,460
a little v  elocemente oh well

1050
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:17,250
the cloud registration procedure is the classic one

1051
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,240
insert an e-

1052
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,400
mail address you receive the confirmation e-mail

1053
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,910
you choose an account that

1054
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:26,550
will become the left side of an

1055
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,820
e-mail at the dot email that is

1056
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,250
provided by the foundation

1057
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:36,150
obviously there is  the confirmation and on the cloud side

1058
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,000
we discover that there is

1059
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,570
a fork of next cloud

1060
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:45,870
it is a fort where the server side has

1061
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,510
been implemented

1062
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,640
end to end creepshow so in short, as

1063
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,400
you know very well it is a question that not even

1064
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,550
the system administrators of the

1065
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:58,470
funds cannot access the ai

1066
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,019
our data

1067
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:02,720
we obviously also have the other areas

1068
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,049
the other data the contacts the calendar

1069
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:10,400
the photos and the e-mail

1070
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,920
obviously for those who want to have

1071
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,930
their own personal cloud they have the

1072
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,369
possibility of integrating on their

1073
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:20,970
next cloud server or as I said

1074
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:22,980
before any other server that supports

1075
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,599
the  standard protocols of Caldav card

1076
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:29,789
or and the ddv desh platform itself is made available

1077
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:31,819


1078
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:34,009
aun

1079
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:36,289
is

1080
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:38,369
deprived quite understandably also

1081
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:40,349
of e-mail servers but there is

1082
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:41,869
the image that allows you to

1083
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:45,900
install it on your server

1084
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,980
I would stop here possibly for

1085
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,980
some questions if there are any or otherwise

1086
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,349
I don't know how we are with the time

1087
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:58,829
sebastiano ok contempo  we're good

1088
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:01,950
let's say yes you have questions can you make

1089
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:04,319
the hand and get the deal

1090
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,829
come here to me

1091
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:10,529
question from one of those who already has a

1092
00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:13,069


1093
00:48:14,779 --> 00:48:18,750
phone why should i choose i s

1094
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:22,380
rather somewhere in the middle s with micro g

1095
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,450
then i don't  I'm here to

1096
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:28,109
promote sponsoring us in fondation I

1097
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:29,730
'm clarifying because I don't know

1098
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:32,220
maybe I'm too enthusiastic but

1099
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:35,359
my idea is to present an

1100
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,490
alternative project

1101
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:40,109
I think your question arises from an

1102
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:41,579
evaluation of the capabilities of the operating system

1103
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:43,759


1104
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:47,160
what I  I find it interesting

1105
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,309
this case is that we have a

1106
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:53,630
complete ecosystem so maybe even

1107
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,000
though we got to this point here and or

1108
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,160
it was born to fight role

1109
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,259
google garden at this point they are not

1110
00:49:01,259 --> 00:49:03,660
introducing me to their walled garden

1111
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,190
ok they give me the possibility

1112
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:06,960
of self hosting but still

1113
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,849
email preferably if

1114
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:09,780
they win

1115
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,000
it which at this point is practically

1116
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,800
going from the frying pan to the grill

1117
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,330
also because I anyway  I'm using a

1118
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,670
service of which I don't know where the

1119
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:19,890
servers are because in any case it is not

1120
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,240
specified anywhere on the e

1121
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,820
foundation site where are these machines if

1122
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,610
they comply with the gd pr and above all

1123
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,770
I don't know what they are doing on the

1124
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:31,680
machines because as one knows very well the

1125
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,020
cloud is not actually cloud computing it has

1126
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,410
someone else's computer sure sure

1127
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,990
then

1128
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,270
you know what the servers are like you also know that they

1129
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:46,400
are powered by renewable energies and

1130
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,100
information in this sense

1131
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,020
I repeat I am not sponsoring new

1132
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,330
re I'll give you the answers because what

1133
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,100
they read I'm sponsoring in any

1134
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,350
way

1135
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:59,640
so he pulled the answers also because

1136
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,170
I made these doubts about his

1137
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,850
s  tesse questions and tito the answers

1138
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:05,600
I found ok it

1139
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,600
was the part of you were telling

1140
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,280
me where the servers are then what it was remind me where

1141
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,400
the servers are they are in European territory and they

1142
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,680
are gtp areas with briand what

1143
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,720
they report is there  a part that

1144
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,970
says that we divert cobian so from

1145
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:25,860
this point of view the information is

1146
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,680
there then also here it is a bit of the usual

1147
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,870
speech that can be done for many other

1148
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:33,470
realities it is the objection that sometimes makes me

1149
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:36,660
say ah ok you install software for me

1150
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,700
free you tell me that you can say the

1151
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,320
sources spot that will never see and

1152
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,750
sources not it's always the same

1153
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:45,450
objection is rightly 1 both these

1154
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:47,280
doubts can preferably use

1155
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,140
continue to use google and

1156
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,570
google servers if you feel more

1157
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:53,970
protected on this side I  I believe

1158
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:56,430
that running open source software on my mobile,

1159
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:59,820
basing it on my servers

1160
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,680
where I installed my data,

1161
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,710
gives me personally more

1162
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:07,020
capital guarantees than google, in short, the

1163
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,210
dis  course is more than anything since that

1164
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:12,630
anyway and or s is a direct fork of line

1165
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:16,500
and gs with micro g if I still take

1166
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,240
line i.e. if with micro g that there is the

1167
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,000
unofficial project as the parts

1168
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,279
I find practically the same

1169
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:26,069
solution without  be bound by both the

1170
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:27,659
release cycles which are

1171
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:30,089
slower than those of line and gs and

1172
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:32,189
above all I also release myself from the

1173
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,799
o s code and therefore I release myself from the whole

1174
00:51:34,799 --> 00:51:37,619
part of the pre-integrated cloud services I

1175
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:40,650
release you from their app store which in any case

1176
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:43,169
as from the slides  the source

1177
00:51:43,169 --> 00:51:45,239
of certain applications is not known so I

1178
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:46,380
don't have the faintest idea of ​​where

1179
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,289
they got these apks

1180
00:51:48,289 --> 00:51:51,029
when I can still install the ngs

1181
00:51:51,029 --> 00:51:53,729
with micro g install aurora store and

1182
00:51:53,729 --> 00:51:55,739
get the evaluation anyway if to pull them with

1183
00:51:55,739 --> 00:51:57,959
exodus of the privacy risk of the

1184
00:51:57,959 --> 00:51:59,999
applications  down directly from

1185
00:51:59,999 --> 00:52:01,679
google and do the verification with

1186
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:05,989
google certificates are due

1187
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:11,809
ok if no more questions

1188
00:52:11,809 --> 00:52:14,900
but there are more questions so

1189
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,669
thanks to  there is a question I'm coming

1190
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:23,619
more than a question perhaps an answer

1191
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:25,450
to the topic in my opinion from what I understand

1192
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:28,599
the elementary os project I think it's an

1193
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:32,079
intermediate step perhaps compared to fool

1194
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,240
self hosted I do everything myself I

1195
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,920
compile the apk I do everything I

1196
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,430
want  I'm a less

1197
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:41,309
experienced user who perhaps wants to

1198
00:52:41,309 --> 00:52:43,539
use their phone in a

1199
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:46,089
simple way without necessarily being

1200
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:48,460
tied to a because to all

1201
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,039
intents and purposes this is an intermediate step being

1202
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:54,039
able to move the back end is in any case an

1203
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:59,230
intermediate step between google and apple and me

1204
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:01,539
I buy a vps remi stall

1205
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:05,980
the former cloud everything else no indeed

1206
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,589
thank you also because I agree

1207
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:11,410
with this position what I see I

1208
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:14,430
have my opinion because I repeat I

1209
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:17,529
find it absolutely legitimate and I like

1210
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:18,819
that there is the possibility of being able to

1211
00:53:18,819 --> 00:53:20,829
choose  between several solutions and therefore

1212
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:22,359
also for those who risk doing so to

1213
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:24,519
adopt that solution but I find that

1214
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:26,200
this is a specific approach that

1215
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,930
is pragmatic pragmatic  i.e. the idea

1216
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:30,539
is to say

1217
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:33,309
I want to try to get out of the niche

1218
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:35,049
I want to try to make a proposal that

1219
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:36,670
also that's

1220
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:37,990
why I said in the introduction look I don't

1221
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,569
understand almost anything about mobile telephony

1222
00:53:39,569 --> 00:53:42,670
because it's not necessary to be scaled

1223
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:45,130
to  succeed while to do what

1224
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:47,559
you say a little something you need to know here

1225
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:49,240
I buy the phone in stallone upload

1226
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,849
I use I'm done and if I have to compare the

1227
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:53,079
two solutions

1228
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:55,390
I prefer one it's an approach that can

1229
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:57,309
but pragmatic I see it in my

1230
00:53:57,309 --> 00:53:59,049
personal experience as I said

1231
00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:02,400
in  'introduction I've been

1232
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,390


1233
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:08,859
disseminating open source software

1234
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:11,049
for companies for about fifteen years but the only thing I've

1235
00:54:11,049 --> 00:54:13,390
done is that when windows told me

1236
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:15,549
ok let's use windows it's because the field

1237
00:54:15,549 --> 00:54:17,769
is hot but the management software we use

1238
00:54:17,769 --> 00:54:20,230
management software and I went  leenstra windows now

1239
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,789
there's a lot of open source software

1240
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:24,069
going around so the approach

1241
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:26,079
that is a little more rigorous is right because

1242
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,150
there needs to be  or in any case chiti years full

1243
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,750
stop who goes to annoy the boxes

1244
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,340
but not despair less the approaches

1245
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,170
that are more pragmatic because they make us

1246
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,210
take a step ahead of my parents from my point of view

1247
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,250
between a

1248
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,320


1249
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,790
classic mobile phone and a given group mobile phone

1250
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:43,490
where maybe  I'll sort it out with two apps I'll

1251
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,420
buy illegal roma lario

1252
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,410
mobile phone of this type

1253
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,790
here questions then wait for it to come this way

1254
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:59,540
second second careers

1255
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,580
I was a little distracted so I hope I'm

1256
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,040
not asking a question has

1257
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,310
the all types of

1258
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:11,730
connections that occur from the  of the

1259
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,940
mobile phone to understand if there are

1260
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,790
strange things going around

1261
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,890
look I don't know how to answer with certainty it's

1262
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:22,560
not a mandate that I can give you with

1263
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,040
certainty I know that if you go around

1264
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,470
the community you will see that they hit

1265
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:31,080
enough because it is clear and you propose yourself

1266
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,990
as a sensitive project  to privacy and

1267
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,580
those who arrive are all

1268
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,500
sensitive to privacy I know that there are

1269
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,280
many checks done on the data

1270
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,900
you have  ngo transmitted there are

1271
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,160
comparisons for example between

1272
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,320
what a mobile phone does with google is what it

1273
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,530
does beyond a custom rom but I would tell you

1274
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,750
a lie it is not a Syrian fact that it

1275
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,260
is certain

1276
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:57,780


1277
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,790
I don't see any other questions

1278
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,840
so thanks to underwater and marco

1279
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,640
calamari  who spoke earlier for

1280
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,280
this interesting cable thanks

1281
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,350
for sharing your experience

1282
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:16,110
your knowledge with aler summer camp
