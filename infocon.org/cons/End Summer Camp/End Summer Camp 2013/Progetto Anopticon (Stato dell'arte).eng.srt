1
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,150
presentation project anopticon we are under

2
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,570
video surveillance it would be

3
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,430


4
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,970
probation our privacy is just a nice

5
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,980
memory we check our communications

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,559
are intercepted there is censorship

7
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,350
we are moving towards global control

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,850
with the term control we mean

9
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,350
all this disclosure of the rights

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,149
of the individual deny in any way and

11
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,339
by any means entirely in part

12
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:47,780
the freedom of the controlled with

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,929
the uniform assume biagi thinking and

14
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,159
certain an illegitimate act against the

15
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,889
committed this gesture from milan there are

16
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,780
different types of control

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,280
we face from the conceptual point of view

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,469
we have the mind control

19
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:02,719
that aims  to change the perception of

20
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,819
reality and the world below we are confronted

21
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,850
by changing the same practice a little at a time

22
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,289
that I also lack the level of

23
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:11,780
political control by making

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,390
things accept a little once with small lenk the

25
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,820
changes of course there is also

26
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,439
physical control  which consists precisely

27
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,170
in preventing determination  with

28
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,570
walls with padlocks or other

29
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,680
material

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,079
and then there is surveillance is the

31
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,210
control input or that element that

32
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,280
allows you to know how people

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,170
behave

34
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,369
this is an example of physical control

35
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:37,520
is called active snai to the earthquake is  a weapon

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,040
that the

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,440
microwaves under the skin react

38
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,880
and therefore when the

39
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,830
burning sensation was used and

40
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,630
advertised to quell the so-called

41
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,880
riots has recently given problems

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,310
becomes because it seems to

43
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,770
hurt the eyes slightly as as you know

44
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,430
the eyes can resonate inside waves

45
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,780
where now we face the opposite from the

46
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,850
point of view only in conceptual ideal

47
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,500


48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,110
we talk about mind control

49
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,160
summarizing some

50
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,930
neurolinguistic techniques we can say that in

51
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,210
our brain there is a scheme a map

52
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,470
of concepts that I wanted to represent

53
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,330
with these drawings

54
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,250
each of these concepts and  linked to

55
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,310
others therefore this is also called

56
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,680
culture if we understand the piece of

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,540
this  mass of connections

58
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,750
we change how people with politics 19

59
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,240
not reality if for example established

60
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,340
that wearing red shoes

61
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,989
means being a better person

62
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,510
everyone will wear red shoes but it

63
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,220
is associated with a product of

64
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,730
modified culture naturally this

65
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,040
information these concepts

66
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,930
also reside  in different areas of our

67
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,880
brain the most central parts

68
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,040
react to stimuli cues there is

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,680
naturally they do not use the part

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,930
of the intelligence instead the parts that

71
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,459
are more on the surface of the brain

72
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,739
such as the cortex carry out all the

73
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,670
complications and

74
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,050
national relations and therefore we say that they are

75
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,530
concepts  intelligence I wanted to

76
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,409
draw an image that represents a

77
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:08,780
concept this year external something

78
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,340
that our perception is not able to

79
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,650
understand because in the visible our

80
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,900
brain is configured to protect us

81
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,150
from a manifest danger the grandmother a

82
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,090
sneaky danger and therefore as you see the

83
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,670
fear and other concepts c  as the

84
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,769
immediate danger are connected in the

85
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:26,329
less intelligent part in our brain the

86
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:29,569
one that reacts first but to our

87
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:32,090
brain how it develops it develops

88
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,349
on the basis of what it sees

89
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:35,720
in the environment there is by observing the world

90
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,310
acquires information to the

91
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,290
brain it develops it develops  makes an idea of the

92
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,780
world you create a theory of the mind and

93
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,209
that is that map you saw before

94
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,340
but what would happen if in

95
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,890
modern reality there was an apparatus that

96
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,410
allows us to see the world the

97
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,769
simplification we

98
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:53,840
will use these apparatuses to understand

99
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,910
and see the world  and if someone for

100
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,440
commercial reasons or for other reasons

101
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,900
change and the image well we will have a

102
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,030
different image of the world and

103
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,430
that configuration that

104
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,440
controls information controls culture and

105
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,970
how our brain develops and

106
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,880
what should be done if someone to

107
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,510
observe  this for men in

108
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,789
the middle process could make an operation

109
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:23,180
turn to and understand based on the  and

110
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,789
reactions as the brain develops and it

111
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:28,310
could drive as a moment but if I

112
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,410
put this information to the other

113
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,349
information this develops as I

114
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:36,039
say how I can in principle

115
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,349
control how it behaves this is

116
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:42,970
here and together the semantics of control

117
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:49,690
but let's talk about fear  fear and you

118
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,099
expressly waste a certain type of

119
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:54,710
fear anxiety anxiety is a fear of a

120
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,060
message of danger that is not

121
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,870
necessarily black but does not have a

122
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,310
precise reference

123
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,740
fear is a bit like them black because

124
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,390
how frightening a person

125
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,640
reacts with  the less intelligent part

126
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,890
of the brain lower its

127
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,849
mental defenses take down every defense system

128
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:15,770
when you exponent people frightening

129
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,050
and demoralizing people it is easier to

130
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,969
control

131
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:22,689
but where does fear come from

132
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,129
what is the source of this information

133
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,809
this is the state of fear in  italy

134
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,759
is an image produced and enlarged by the

135
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,779
mass media the facts

136
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,839
this is a result of a

137
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,549
scientific observatory de  The European

138
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:43,629
observatory on security detection of pavia

139
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:48,329
this is the trend of crimes

140
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:51,339
this is the trend of people's perception

141
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:54,099
of crimes and this is the

142
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:56,529
level of information on crimes that

143
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:59,169
we always see on television

144
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:01,239
as you can see the three lines are

145
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:02,799
completely  different

146
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:03,939
so we have already understood that

147
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,919
television gives us absolutely no idea

148
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,159
and measure of how much crime there may

149
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:10,569
be around because it goes in the

150
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:14,049
diametrically opposite direction and therefore we have

151
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:15,759
already understood that on the basis of this

152
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,789
scientific survey done by questioning

153
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:20,979
many people doing scientific studies

154
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:23,529
and watching  many news outlets

155
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:26,259
we have understood that television is not

156
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,929
a good means of information to understand

157
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:30,879
how much crime there is

158
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,949
and how much security there is

159
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:35,529
but note that an interesting thing here

160
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:39,279
is a peak that corresponds to 2007

161
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,409
when not to lower the

162
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:44,189
security package of who the televisions are

163
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:46,509
because there is this

164
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:50,549
diametrical trend  opposite

165
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,540
and these are the trend

166
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,140
of news perceptions without the case scazzi on

167
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,130
tg1 tg2 tg3 tg4 tg5 in the

168
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:08,420
Italian news and here we have the news of

169
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,070
crime in the European public news

170
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,520
raiuno in the head

171
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,400
wow we are a very dangerous country for the

172
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,010
media you can't get out of  home

173
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,940
so much fear and out there waiting for you and

174
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,160
now we see the crime news

175
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,060
by year and month between tg1 and tg5 always

176
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,130
you see the infamous quito then

177
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,380
open studio and tg3

178
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,740
tg2 and tg4 well come on they are more or less the

179
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,240
problem cannot everyone for  its

180
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,050
some point different political interests

181
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,020
and now crime and economic crisis

182
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,389
in the European public news

183
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:04,419
then until 2010 there was a kind of

184
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,729
censorship about the economic crisis and the

185
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,409
worst living conditions of the people

186
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:11,860
not much talk about it on rai  on

187
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,439
rai1 because here we see that we are talking about

188
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,139
crime worse living conditions

189
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:20,889
crap other is not greeted and of course

190
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,280
instead in other countries for example  pio

191
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,740
the situation is very different they talk about

192
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,110
something else etc. it is very interesting

193
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,120
also

194
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,979
this crime news by type of

195
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,809
renzo criminals of

196
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:38,529
european public newscasts organized

197
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:41,349
crime common crime

198
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,100
other criminal cases rai 1 t 2 etcetera

199
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,680
always rai in the head

200
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,029
we are a very dangerous country brands

201
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:55,060
what is big brother is really a

202
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,850
person who observes us has nothing

203
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,170
to do with the transmission of

204
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,230
endemol big brother a basic

205
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,730
abstract concept what we want to address

206
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,449
here as big brother I wanted to use

207
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:09,250
this imaginative need to explain

208
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,459
a little how they work  certain dynamics

209
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,740
then information that does not generate

210
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,470
alarmism has a low audience

211
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,600
information that generates alarmism to

212
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,870
another audience generally if

213
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,730
the information occurs because

214
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,620
objectively the information that causes

215
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,410
alarmism to excite let's say the

216
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,180
unintelligent parts in the brain and

217
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,680
those that should protect us from

218
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,420
danger  i that if for example

219
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,920
here in this room no other

220
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,860
ferocious lion we are doing a

221
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,750
philosophical reasoning we run away we do not think

222
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,230
too much about it you have to base the information

223
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,300
is filtered by letting so much

224
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,340


225
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,520
fear pass people will train themselves to perceive

226
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,710
that everything is  scary and once you

227
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,510
see the television with all

228
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,820
that fear news the world will start to

229
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,160
be a little bit more dangerous and

230
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,860
then there is an equation if fear more

231
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,960
hicks equals money I get rich or

232
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,120
this makes me very rich

233
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,160
this palliative system  it could

234
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,170
be a fatality but if it were all

235
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,090
planned then there would really be

236
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,080
a big brother but let's see for a moment

237
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,450
a camera is not the big brother

238
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,640
the induced fear is not the big

239
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,470
brother these are all pieces of a

240
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,930
puzzle the big brother is the image

241
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,820
of  'together with the puzzle there are so many

242
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
dynamics so many people involved

243
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,070
I don't believe in the conspiracy theory but

244
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,260
there are different causal relationships  to

245
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,840
effect that lead to dynamics of

246
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,500
this type

247
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,760
then I do not exclude that maybe there is

248
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,170
some madman who is plotting

249
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,120
his own business problems but

250
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,320
in general

251
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,170
unfortunately the situation is this we see

252
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,610
now big brother from the point of

253
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,240
view of model systems

254
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,960
acquisition of information from

255
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,760
video surveillance cameras and other

256
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,540
systems

257
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,430
or from telecommunications networks

258
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,470
observes and makes a user profile

259
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,770
with censorship controls the

260
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,970
information information arrives in

261
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,470
mass publication systems where

262
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,900
mental manipulation takes place as seen before

263
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,460
and  our reaction comes back like

264
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,870
a wolf so on the basis of this

265
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,380
verification

266
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:19,050
we are in check but we try to

267
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,270
understand what a panoptic panoptic

268
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,610
is it is not an ideal prison designed by

269
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,870
jeremy bentham in 1791 then resumed the focus the

270
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,520
funny thing that I knew and seeing you were

271
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,650
the  panopticon actually existing

272
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,630
today it is a prison is made in

273
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,370
a circular way  and where all the cells are

274
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,380
perfectly visible and in the center there is

275
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,180
a tower where there is the overseer

276
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,980
the evolution of the panoptic lies precisely

277
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,110
in the fact that no more walls are used but

278
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,980
there is a vision

279
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,020
the association of being guarded

280
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,790
there  'uncertainty of knowing if here at this

281
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,140
moment there is someone who was

282
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,960
observing this and panoptic is a new

283
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,700
way of getting to be able to increase on the

284
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,250
mind

285
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,990
it has never been done before but it is not

286
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,300
all here panopticon also leads to

287
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,740
paroxysm observing the behaviors

288
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,290
of the  people to make docile bodies

289
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,730
amenable to the exercise of power

290
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,370
and that is to take those people who are

291
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,380
vulnerable to control systems to

292
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,870
control them a different sheet that I was

293
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,300
explaining at the beginning panoptic in a

294
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,190
physical control system because it

295
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,080
actually acts on the control system

296
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,240
on the exploitation of the

297
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,980
fear of doing right or wrong and of

298
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,810
being monitored

299
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,230
now we are talking about video surveillance already

300
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,820
at the time  even fire

301
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,920
they thought that setting up

302
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,570
surveillance devices around the cities

303
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,360
could be a practice to

304
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,790
implement them control in a general sense

305
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,860
obviously they did not ask themselves the

306
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,060
question of installing

307
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,490
intelligent cameras being

308
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,310
philosophers only the discourse of

309
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,290
devices fatality

310
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,450
today we are in  this situation

311
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,620
in the video surveillance air

312
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,420
there should be this information sign

313
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,820
by law that warns you not always like this

314
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,350
but in the municipalities

315
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,540
this sign should only be installed in the surveillance nest area

316
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,890
which are connected to the

317
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,430
police

318
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,910
often these signs are missing so

319
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,970
here is the initial signal reappears

320
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,650
a  something that you do not see and devious

321
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,690
so you do not know you do not realize

322
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,880
how much this danger is advancing you

323
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,630
recognize the cameras

324
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,250
with modern technologies are able

325
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,430
to recognize us by analyzing

326
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,110
key features in the face you can give a

327
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,480
confirmation of different patterns until you

328
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,250
get to recognize  the person  

329
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,090
analyzed and therefore one day it could

330
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,860
resist printouts of our

331
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,140
movements identified through the

332
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,670
video surveillance cameras

333
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,950
ask yourself why in the roads outside the

334
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,610
country from 2010 onwards the mountain villages and

335
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,320
between a high-altitude location there are

336
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,990
cameras that are not speed cameras

337
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,330
and are not  not even of the red map but not

338
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,180
the number plates of the cars follow us the

339
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,940
cameras this is a video I took

340
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,710
from a video surveillance system where

341
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,930
you can see people with an identification code it

342
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,990
is a trace so there

343
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,270
are already more or less intelligent systems in place

344
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,400
that can trace the

345
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,350
movements of the people who are there

346
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,470
where you go substantially trace

347
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,430
our movements

348
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,320
this program that allows you to

349
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,420
identify the movement of this

350
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,920
unfortunate and this program allows,

351
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,080
among other things, to create

352
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,810
a

353
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,150
current representation of the movements examined

354
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,920
analyze our behaviors

355
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,900
this program is very much  or simple in the

356
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,860
upper left we have an image

357
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,420
of the camera

358
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,920
here there is the pattern match which is a

359
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,060
kind of recognition system

360
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,640
of the figures the movements and here

361
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,050
we can see reproduced the

362
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,640
behavior as the computer sees it

363
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,870
this represents the

364
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,790
camera that these  bill the two if you

365
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:53,300
leave on the object it analyzes our

366
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,170
behaviors

367
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,470
this is an example of urban control

368
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,240
and this is the functioning of the

369
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,880
program the camera and via

370
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,910
identified here we can mark the

371
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,100
monitored video areas to start

372
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,410
alarm messages

373
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,230
then when the camera passes it

374
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,000
analyzes  this place when it locates

375
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,940
an object in this case the machine

376
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,430
displays an alarm and

377
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,930
then you can make system that in

378
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,310
this video is rather rudimentary and

379
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,670
the funny thing is that this software

380
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,800
look at the quality of the graphics

381
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,330
look at the quality of the computer still

382
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,790
the floppy was running  the year 1998

383
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,080
this is another example of a

384
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,330
chase d  in the same program

385
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,630
the close-up image and the

386
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,360
distant image unknown subject walking

387
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,530
obviously this is still an

388
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,150
experimental thing he is making a

389
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,970
well-defined path but today there are

390
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:04,320
very very simple systems maybe think that

391
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,540
this technology only exists on

392
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,390
star trek

393
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:12,750
I would say  di no they know who we are

394
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,790
this is an advertising video to a

395
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,470
video surveillance system

396
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,600
practically a

397
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,390
facial recognition software which then has a

398
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,240
kind of score so to speak where

399
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,770
you can see over time what people have

400
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,660
done here we see the

401
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,490
recognized star trek characters

402
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,960
this episode is very interesting

403
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,860
because no of the subjects of the episode at

404
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,900
a certain moment acquires

405
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,090
unlimited intellectual abilities it

406
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,460
becomes the sending of a planet it is very

407
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,500
interesting to know what is going on in the

408
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,880
heads of the people who made

409
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,190
this commercial think about

410
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,590
this concept in the head  who

411
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,300
made this commercial  subconscious level

412
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,020


413
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,540
what kind of information is spinning in those

414
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,719
heads

415
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,200
how far they can go this

416
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,710
is another advertising video

417
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:10,400
how far they want to go but

418
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,260
what they want they want the world

419
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,349
watch tac and videos that advertise the

420
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,359
guy I trust with the other two cops  who

421
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,020
look to the world

422
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,849
the fact that the consciousness of what

423
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,970
others are doing

424
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,860
or the power information is power

425
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,169
and putting oneself above the tracking is

426
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:41,710
power and what is coming

427
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,240
what the power of a person entails is

428
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,850
limited but with this system  they open

429
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,530
the information on the arches to levels

430
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,690
that one day will lead us to a

431
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,640
situation of insecurity where there

432
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,350
will be in subjects with a much

433
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,169
higher power and without there being any

434
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:01,120
democratic element that has decided

435
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,940
the industrial business to be able to them

436
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,210
private interests on  this creates a situation of

437
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,130
insecurity because the increase of the

438
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,669
control the security of languages is all

439
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:14,620
legal no but  there are

440
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,890
passwords terrorism security precisely then

441
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,070
we will see what security means

442
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,840
practically human evolution has

443
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,780
come from very animal concepts

444
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,910
up to today's modern man

445
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,190
we are coming here but this type

446
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,780
of control is nothing more than  the

447
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,330
same mentality we had here that

448
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,620
of power the rule of law

449
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,169
obviously our social evolution

450
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:39,580
has allowed that this does not happen

451
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,450
helps we have an alien so

452
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,740
basically the situation is that it is up

453
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,120
to us to change things

454
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,679
now let's talk about venice

455
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,600
specifically venice and us  are more than 800

456
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,640
cameras have been explained by

457
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,620
the anopticon project through the map

458
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,610
of video surveillance cameras

459
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,500
as you can see these points are precisely the

460
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,540
cameras these represent more

461
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,640
points

462
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,910
in short aggregated thanks to the map

463
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,500
of the cameras we could see

464
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,630
the control area these red areas

465
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,620
are one  magnitude the projection we say

466
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,000
three-dimensional of the a  ree of control

467
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,310
then realize how big they are

468
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,090
and this is the overlap

469
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,430
of the areas I believe that here are the

470
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,520
most overlapping parts and now we see the

471
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,070
argos system is not a game of

472
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,810
real increases that what he is seeing

473
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,360
are right in the red poles on the

474
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,190
recognition of the

475
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:47,910
moving boats and here the fact that it is called

476
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,340
gardos which is a bit of a stretch reminds

477
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,710
a bit difficult tonight drain and conductor

478
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,900
de try to imagine what these

479
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,810
people in the party is a system for

480
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,000
detecting wave motion and

481
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,700
water traffic which then as  provide the

482
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,920
most modern systems of the period

483
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,110
panic room style in via the handheld in the

484
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,270
mobile phone and fantastic to have their own

485
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,040
exercise of power on the mobile

486
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,930
many people who have

487
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,340
video surveillance systems in the guard

488
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,410
rely on these things

489
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,450
this is how obviously now the

490
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,190
operations center works a  bit more modern than

491
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,380
this but basically this was the

492
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,900
original system they drew on

493
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,210
logic of the robots and this is a cell

494
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,520
of the argos system these domes are

495
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,040
the cameras that join the

496
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,620
images together creating an image of the grand canal of

497
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,020
venice without ancient

498
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,270
shadow with

499
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,260
real-time recognition of the objects

500
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,770
here is how civil argos to see  the

501
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,270
film of the accounts what we have read

502
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,800
so far somehow it was

503
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,720
happening without being too

504
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,900
conspiratorial there is also the camera for

505
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,700
the chase and this is the panoramic camera

506
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,470


507
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,030
this is the coverage which assisted

508
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,420
August the expansions and here then there is

509
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,170
another system

510
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,630
this is the handheld if you want

511
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,760
you too enter in 10

512
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,310
the many easy ones and then I wait for

513
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,560
the camera in the argos system just

514
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,990
a kind of info in the middle so to speak

515
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,810
how often this is the close up view they

516
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,930
are double lens in  o for

517
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,410
the day and one for dante and if this

518
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,300
is the adwords system camera

519
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,610
this is a hydra system camera

520
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,010
an even more powerful system  you

521
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,860
for a canal for a much larger

522
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,140
canal the Giudecca canal three kilometers by

523
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,050
300 meters fully guarded

524
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,890
without shadow cones and this is the image

525
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,620
of the fiber system camera up

526
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,800
close these are the stigmata they

527
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,750
display and these are the

528
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,170
external cameras  that there is no sensor that

529
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,180
measures the speed a common car was enough

530
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,250
apple tree how much money was

531
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,220
wasted had they take the wave

532
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,370
these as we see margot the map

533
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,500
that can be seen on the site in the argos system

534
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,840
we have unlocked some functions

535
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,880
that  with the zoom they would allow you to

536
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,290
see these dots that are the

537
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,020
boats and therefore the system

538
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,830
comes to us like this but there is a much more

539
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,950
interesting part that should be observed is

540
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,900
nothing strange

541
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,810
now I will show it to you better that is a

542
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,950
red point and then yellow than outside  from the

543
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,370
reach of the arco system and here there are

544
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,980
the doctors' houses in canals and what does it

545
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:42,440
mean that argos also sees on the ground

546
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,760
and yes these are on the ground

547
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,040
here it is  rzo that controls the

548
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,080
wave motion in the street

549
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,720
we are already at the second step the second step is

550
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,779
the newspeak channel changed to road

551
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:00,179
and of course boat changed to

552
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,570
a car people does not matter

553
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,340
but who is interested in measuring the way

554
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,179
of use on the ground that there are no  channels and

555
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,269
this is arduous spies with

556
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:14,090
night lighting systems this camera

557
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:18,240
works and this one you cannot find on

558
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,970
the argos system website is not official

559
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,440
and here is another one that

560
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,330
explained to the point that you have seen before

561
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,950
at 90 degrees compared  to the canal and these

562
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,649
are the movements of people seen

563
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:33,360
through the system close to a

564
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,049
dot above just as seen in

565
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:45,090
1998 but because they are interested in the wave motion of the

566
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,710
asphalt but damn I

567
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,870
could not think of the poet's boat in

568
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,779
short and now we see a bit of

569
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:59,399
argos system errors we

570
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:01,200
marked errors yellow this boat is

571
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,139
multiple marked this boat

572
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:05,970
does not have a precise position

573
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,980
here l  and fines are doubled and

574
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,929
it moves with respect to the position

575
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:12,179
in short there is no pattern system

576
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,000
exit very good 15

577
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,429
fines are made to the waves

578
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:18,590
they have even toto from the website

579
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,960
wi fi rossi after the publication of

580
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,119
this video because they realized

581
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,220
in  too many to do for example the fine to the

582
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,720
water behind the boat was not

583
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,700
really the best like doing the

584
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,619
double triple fines or rather the fines am

585
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:32,330
points Lecce will be etcetera etcetera

586
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,999
etcetera

587
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:39,740
and there is something wrong an interpellation has come out

588
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,389
at the level  of the

589
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:43,159
city council that argos that argos

590
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:44,869
doesn't work cannot be used

591
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:47,119
to combine hires and

592
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,649
wonder why that money has not been

593
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:51,799
wasted or used if you prefer

594
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:57,799
the most working ways well to

595
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,179
meet this situation we

596
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:00,619
have not invented a little program that  it is

597
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:02,840
called automatic asthma recognizes a

598
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,759
bi system blogger activities is a

599
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:06,710
system of recognition of the actions

600
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,960
of the great friar  llo

601
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,419
we had to dedicate a separate talk

602
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:12,529
on this thing

603
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:14,840
practically it is an

604
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,419
artificial intelligence system that controls

605
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:19,820
the operation of the argos system and

606
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,100
we realized that something is wrong

607
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,749
now I save you camera by

608
00:25:23,749 --> 00:25:26,090
camera but until a few months ago

609
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,600
before the restorations half  some cameras

610
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,749
did not work and these were

611
00:25:32,749 --> 00:25:35,809
cameras that were just broken did not

612
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:37,429
work so much so that at a certain

613
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:40,179
point they removed them and then replaced them

614
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:44,059
and hydra work well ibra which is a

615
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:45,980
system made after bigger is no

616
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,080
then let's see the first  camera the

617
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,940
ibra system above the extra that it finds

618
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,499
holds high it was the last to be

619
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:54,200
installed and sorry these are what they do

620
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,559
here with the telelaser but but they are under the

621
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,370
camera it

622
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,379
seems not even that works

623
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,690
but who is antonio is a piece that I

624
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,670
wonder  who antonio but to know just

625
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,040
see the sources of the site of the hardware system I

626
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,930


627
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,130
omit the element because I carry it

628
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,980
for asthma but through this  i am link that

629
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,020
you can see update me according to you can

630
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,400
get the serial number of each

631
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,830
tracked object its gps coordinates

632
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,200
and speed directly in

633
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,120
real time from the argos system without any

634
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,950
password without any protection

635
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,050
all our data is public there

636
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,870
is no security is  fantastic you can

637
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,410
record the activity of anyone then

638
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,350
the coordinates you go

639
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,370
everyone's coordinates are absolutely published

640
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,660
so we have economic interests

641
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,230
power abuses contracts and we are

642
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,030
happy with all this and we

643
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,270
realize what is

644
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,470
happening they convinced us to be in a

645
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,240
quite happy panopticons by

646
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,340
changing the aspect of reality by

647
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,710
disguising as security by

648
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,840
filling us with cameras that

649
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
we will then see why they are useless

650
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,010
putting us a little at a time in this

651
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,740
situation

652
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,150
these are

653
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,880
video surveillance experiments so criminals

654
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,940
could be in the situation to

655
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,460
act the information could be

656
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,260
controlled  a fear will lead to

657
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,730
control and what do we want the

658
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,670
security cameras equal control and

659
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,340
the new change of Newspeak this

660
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,330
is the security package then trieste

661
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,710
and 400 thousand euros that the cameras

662
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,720
golizia 120 thousand euros with the

663
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,970
udine cameras 600 thousand euros for and

664
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,300
pordenone and 540 cameras  thousand euros for those

665
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,820
this is the first trance one million

666
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,220
660 thousand euros of cameras on this

667
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,460
city ok so a lot of

668
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,930
cameras around Italy poles that you

669
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,000
could do a patrol with but

670
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,490
also of the police lands 224 of 27

671
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,080
times around the  world or to

672
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,620
scale taxes

673
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,090
the camera costs around 600 17

674
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,220
euros but in favor of Venice we

675
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,730
paid 9,060 thousand euros each in

676
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,250
Venice they asked for 5.2 million

677
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,740
euros for the most naturally

678
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,810
arduous cameras 63 which involve millions of

679
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,440
extra euros

680
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,430
and  it is not a question of magna magna

681
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,770
therefore equal cameras in security

682
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,510
at least privacy less freedom

683
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,860
legalized prix control more expenses more

684
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,450
dictatorship here wiretapping without

685
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,640
a magistrate's permission data

686
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,220
retention obviously terrorism is a

687
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,590
password and obviously terrorism has

688
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,390
been replaced with

689
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,100
common criminals copyright to change

690
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,810
the objective and thus obtain a

691
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,530
more functional password but now we see the crimes under

692
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,480
video surveillance the  failure of the

693
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,530
video surveillance

694
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,410
when they show me a video you see in the

695
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,570
video the robbery it is true that you see the

696
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,700
robbery you also had the failure of the

697
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,800
video surveillance as a deterrent

698
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,160
here the crimes of

699
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,790
serious beatings happened

700
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,110
the next day I went to take the

701
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,460
photo under the video

702
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,680
surveillance camera that  it works in fact

703
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,420
piazzale roma is slightly different from

704
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,870
how it is today and as you can see this is what

705
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:14,530
the camera sees and therefore the

706
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,090
information they had based on

707
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,100
the testimonies not from the images

708
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,560
of the video surveillance cameras

709
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,160
here is the camera this

710
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,850
but the columns of rialto cabbage a

711
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,920
moment have  massacre

712
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,110
in  Even here this and degradation are photos

713
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,910
taken from the emotions of the city

714
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:39,390
council these but never all in the

715
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,160
video surveillance area with

716
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,560
functioning cameras but but as they go they

717
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,570
saw them they did not stop them yet everything

718
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,160
happened in the video surveillance area

719
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,120
here is the camera and this other

720
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,090
object of degradation of the  common in

721
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:58,020
venice people seated but but they are full of

722
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,750
cameras but then it does not work

723
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,190
much here it is and this camera

724
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,860
should have prevented this should

725
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,330
have prevented this should have

726
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,010
prevented this should have prevented

727
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,220
this together with the others of course

728
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,820
and a Madonna also destroyed together

729
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,760
with her  sister and her friend camera

730
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,650
always in the same field this

731
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,890
camera how many but now we see

732
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,080
someone who has done with the car or

733
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,230
an unusual path to reach

734
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,870
the bridge of the spiers we follow the

735
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,790
path and we see that there are several

736
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,980
cameras working with images that

737
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,840
can be extracted from the web  others that the cards

738
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,230
follow  I love the path another camera

739
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,789
we follow the path another camera

740
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:46,230
under that parquet the car has been parked

741
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,630
that the police have been

742
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:53,970
solved because the crazy lady that

743
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,559
finally the rooms one camera

744
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:01,529
second stop the aiab are 3 percent of the

745
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:03,150
crimes

746
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,830


747
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,450


748
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,850
the public park in via piave but not

749
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,799
sent to drug dealers and drug addicts

750
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,200
exasperated residents say the municipality

751
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:20,549
does nothing good kept found with

752
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:24,000
the news of venice mestre in opening the

753
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,460
news by answering the call of the

754
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,279
residents  exasperated we went back to

755
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,289
via piave to check the situation

756
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:34,260
of the public gardens in front of the

757
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,690
station we look at the municipality has

758
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,399
placed nine video surveillance cameras in the surroundings

759
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,440
paid with

760
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,210
our money increases the dose fulvio

761
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,980
lucchetta who for three years represented

762
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,100
the delegation of the area 9 cameras  of

763
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,789
video surveillance and not working  to a

764
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:52,770
cabbage that is, the cameras work they

765
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,870
are on but not that much has changed

766
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:55,980


767
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,600
then safe city

768
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,120
and already here we try to understand what

769
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,340
safe city means the recording

770
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,620
carried out by the municipal police

771
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,740
for institutional activities and I

772
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,779
believed for safety

773
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:17,850
oh well institutional but which ones  these are

774
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,080
the institutional purposes

775
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,730
let's go and see the regulation of the

776
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,370
video surveillance of the municipality of venice

777
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,929
the video surveillance system in

778
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:27,270
summary is aimed at preventing and

779
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,190
repressing the illicit activity

780
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,830
of petty crime episodes

781
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,080
committed in the municipal area and

782
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,760
therefore to ensure greater

783
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,950
security  to citizens

784
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:42,870
perhaps with the zoom the bacteria to protect

785
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,460
the properties owned or managed

786
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,529
by the municipal administration prevent

787
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:47,440
any acts

788
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,409
of soul damaging I would say no

789
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:53,440
they have not succeeded and not even to do

790
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,120
this part here because we have seen the

791
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,100
video taken from the  TV news to

792
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,289
control certain areas

793
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:01,179
monumental

794
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,570
no we are not traffic monitoring

795
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:07,360
vehicles oil tanker parts well

796
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,129
we have seen that argos does not work

797
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:11,559
so here we have failed but what

798
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:16,419
is disturbing and pedestrians where

799
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:17,950
the video surveillance cameras are positioned

800
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,409
what they look

801
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:22,480
we have looked for quite a while and they

802
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,279
are always  positioned in such a way as to

803
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:26,799
see the mandatory

804
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,490
crossing points such as bridges and do not look

805
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,259
inside a field what can

806
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:34,870
happen in the field in the square

807
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,820
but the points to access the field are the

808
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:44,440
mandatory ones so it is disturbing and here

809
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,779
clearly there is also the  prefecture of

810
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:49,210
venice which even notices the

811
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,559
committee for public order and

812
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,230
safety that there is an immeasurable increase in

813
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,789
cameras that there is my problem with

814
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:55,990
the local authorities that shoot a

815
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,309
little too many

816
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:59,200
we have looked at the municipal motions since

817
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,129
2005  to 2013 and let's avoid saying everything to

818
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:04,539
study it there is a bit to try to

819
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:08,069
understand what safety means

820
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:09,969
essentially one  may think that

821
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:12,129
safety means being able to go out on

822
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:14,050
the streets must be sure that

823
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,030
nothing bad happens or that

824
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,040
the law is not violated but as we have seen

825
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,719
from the information we have found

826
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,969
it is not quite so

827
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:24,760
in reality it happens that safety is a

828
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,859
device  protective act take advantage there is

829
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,599
an area in which there are

830
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,690
safe situations of insecurity no then because

831
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,119
of the purchases of houses that have

832
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:35,079
little value

833
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:37,569
you could apply a

834
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:38,840
safety situation safety

835
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,030
laws ordinances

836
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,980
terrestrial cameras resell at a

837
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,560
higher price subsequently insurgent

838
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,620
city has  done a good job on this

839
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,260
on this aspect here that fatality

840
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,969
coincides precisely with what we have

841
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:54,570
found

842
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,880
but what happens and for example

843
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,640
serious people who do not want

844
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,440
6 mb people who look

845
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,320
different even maybe a little punk and not

846
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,080
necessarily taken badly, they put

847
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,580
their business initiatives in front of

848
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,290
their shops  wings if they are not

849
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,570
afraid that customers will not arrive and

850
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,700
this is what has triggered several

851
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,200
security problems in

852
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,120
municipal motions in venice mestre what is

853
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,790
information control

854
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,890
information passes through

855
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,450
information on politicians

856
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,510
ends up in a special storage

857
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,220
instrumentalize  the fear of politics

858
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,540
we what we want

859
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,440
the cameras security the television I

860
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,330
put everything communication one way true

861
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,680
you can only watch what is

862
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,840
transmitted to you this for a hierarchy

863
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,990
pyramid of information and

864
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,700
entertainment where at the top is the

865
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,590
caste for so  to say that it controls it and

866
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,600
underneath there are our newspapers the

867
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,520
television we who observe the

868
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,960
information therefore a human brain

869
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,270
decides how we have seen it evolves

870
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,830
based on the information it finds in its

871
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,760
environment

872
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,860
if it contaminates the environment it

873
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,800
also contaminates the brain and not  is able to

874
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,560
understand what happens maybe once

875
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,410
one thing rather than another

876
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,790
internet is structured i  n different way

877
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,590
it is not easily controllable even if

878
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,960
there are censorship systems which by its

879
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,240
nature can be a turn but let's go back

880
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,380
to the panoptic

881
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,540
the big brother who observes us ipa you also

882
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,190
struggle with him a single point of

883
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,260
reference for information

884
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,790
we are spied on we ask

885
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,950
to the controlled information our

886
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,020
mail is intercepted when at least

887
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,550
once we have thought of such a

888
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,250
thing because we are in the

889
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,950
panoptic cells the pas nights

890
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,770
involves making you fall this control everyone

891
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,570
is not

892
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,260
possible true surveillance is the stakes that

893
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,480
make you put  alone because there is no

894
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,040
surveillance system that can

895
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,790
control people and the

896
00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:00,060
panopticon mass is weak and bagato what

897
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,710
would happen if everyone started to

898
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,710
observe the center of the tower where

899
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,640
the big brother is hidden who

900
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,570
hypothetically observes the panopticon

901
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,000
it transforms it would transform itself into a

902
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,450
night with that is its place or one

903
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,370
could create a solam power  body of the

904
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,870
big brother as it has never been

905
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,430
done before exploiting his

906
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:24,210
fear of being monitored then

907
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,460
big brother we are watching you

908
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,380
in fact we have created a

909
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,480
censorship search engine that displays

910
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,010
which videos are deleted on

911
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,820
youtube what it must say we measured

912
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,390
the censorship then  runs towards the

913
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,460
video surveillance system and the map of the

914
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,290
cameras we have well understood what

915
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,700
the so-called big brother is doing

916
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,890
and then we measure the level

917
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:47,910
of control

918
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,320
what is the relationship between the area and

919
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,210
video surveillance of the city and the air

920
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:54,990
of the city but anopticon is  in various

921
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,030
cities of italy

922
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:01,380
rome alessandria pisa and many many

923
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,030
many other locations

924
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,890
we are calculating the level of

925
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,410
control and on average in other

926
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,620


927
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,420


928
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,800
cities the harvest goes between one and 5 percent regardless of the size of the city,

929
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,310
but there is one thing  interesting venice

930
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,010
37.8 percent of the area under

931
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,790
video surveillance and is constantly

932
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:26,100
increasing and the thing  main make it

933
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,710
argos ibra

934
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,510
now to get an idea we made a

935
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:37,300
render of venice by drawing

936
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,910
the video surveillance area in 3d look how

937
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,430
big is the grand canal and this is

938
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,200
the Giudecca canal so they are

939
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,530
objects after all that exist in

940
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,870
some way but  you do not see products

941
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,160
but turn how big it is and the

942
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,720
video surveillance area but big brother has

943
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,000
been denounced great privacy we

944
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,830
send the camera cards we

945
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,840
denounce the cameras thousand for one

946
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,520
we have raised awareness on

947
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,700
video surveillance excessive sum some of

948
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,920
our directives have entered

949
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,140
the new video surveillance provision

950
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,280
there are limits on

951
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,140
intelligent video surveillance

952
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,390
there is a drastic increase in information signs

953
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,430
and there are investigations on women

954
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,680
take them in progress we measure level of

955
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,380
censorship of freedom control where they

956
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,820
hold the balance

957
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,800
towards dictatorship to democracy

958
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,000
many can do it

959
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,860
we see on  habitat now exists in which

960
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,630
forms this is the project has an optician

961
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:33,570
big brother we are looking at you

962
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,990
and this is

963
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,070
all in order to understand information in a quick and fun way

964
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,660


965
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,550
the control of

966
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,190
information and how it

967
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,010
controls us using an artistic language

968
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,930
later there will also be talk  by

969
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,600
harlow de which is a crasis between

970
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,850
logical art and pure delusion that will explain in

971
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,520
a simple way how they can control us

972
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,710
with information control

973
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,910
using an artistic language
