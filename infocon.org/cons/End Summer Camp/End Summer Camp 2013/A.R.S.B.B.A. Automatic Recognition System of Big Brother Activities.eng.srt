1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,140
then we are going to do it

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,620
the argos system the system

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,840
in the large this video

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,820
demonstrates an example of the operation

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,170
the boats are recognized

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,300
automatically and marked with

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,770
dots the red ones in excess of

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,630
speed the yellow ones in the

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,599
right speed so to speak you immediately notice

10
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:25,369
operating errors

11
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:26,810
imperfections in the system because

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,820
clearly there is no real

13
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,859
pattern matching but it behaves like

14
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:33,019
a device that tracks the objects

15
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:36,650
displayed during the movement arbus

16
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,900
takes its name and is inspired by argol spa

17
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,879
notes and the control system of the

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,070
grand canal which in the end  gives the handhelds

19
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,769
of the traffic police the position of the

20
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:47,510
boats that are in excess of speed

21
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,510
in order to act immediately and make fines

22
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,969
if necessary this was their system

23
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,399
and their operations center and this and

24
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,160
how the cell of the argos system is made

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,719
the vision is  there is a

26
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,059
rectified vision, all the

27
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:03,800
images of the single cells are merged  they have

28
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,320
three cameras each and then between cells

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,300
and cells to make the grand canal and

30
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,110
other channels

31
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,630
a single image without shadow cones and

32
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,060
there are about 40 cameras around

33
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,740
all of Venice

34
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,450
this is how the system sees us all the

35
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,430
boats are recognized  like them

36
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,110
it is also possible to intervene

37
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,080
on the images see the boats up

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,479
close this is the location of the

39
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,860
cameras as it was presented

40
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,930
in the municipality of venice but in reality

41
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,360
there are many others

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,790
this is a screenshot of the handheld and

43
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,040
this is an argos camera  just

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,930
photographed with three speed

45
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,170
dome cameras and of course the wifi antenna

46
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,090
this is the zoom of the camera as it is

47
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,100
done inside they are dual knight lenses

48
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,290
so there is a slight

49
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,659
angle change between day and night and

50
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,460
this is just a photo of a

51
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,049
argos camera taken from the

52
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,380
nights project with this is the site of the

53
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,570
argos system we have cut out only the

54
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,600
part where there is the motion of the

55
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,640
boats  as you can see from

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,259
this figure there is a segment where

57
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,049
strangely there are no boats and here

58
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:10,639
there are many so either they go

59
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,989
another way

60
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:13,430
or when this sequence was recorded

61
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,930
this camera did not

62
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,190
work and neither did this and even here

63
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,019
there is  something wrong

64
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:23,690
and even here and you immediately realize that

65
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,430
there are argos cameras that

66
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,880
are

67
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,130
in the sense that I hear you go and follow

68
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,590
the point on the map or you go with

69
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,020
the boat of auto tracks follows you

70
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,210
notice that at a certain  moment disappears and

71
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,570
reappears and coincidentally photographing the

72
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,850
cameras in several situations you

73
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,800
realize that the central one that the one that

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,930
should levy the fines for months is

75
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,080
always stationary in the same position

76
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,340
other interesting things can be

77
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,880
seen by analyzing the videos better

78
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,020
these videos among other things  they are

79
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,330
satisfied with a recording tool

80
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,190
that has been developed on purpose

81
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,290
called argos recorder, that is, it is able to

82
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,650
practically record the part of the  The

83
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,690
site that you see like this is here we can

84
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,390
see some shifts on land these

85
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,070
shifts on land are there precisely

86
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,330
because some

87
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,120
argos cameras on the ground have been inserted that

88
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,130
observe the walkway of people and

89
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,930
not so much that of boats here for

90
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,150
example there is a  'parking area and sofa

91
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,830
there is a camera this is a video

92
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,680
extracted from the site of the argus system where

93
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,600
you can see people with a dot on

94
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,510
them moving then to try to

95
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,220
understand the phenomenon and understand

96
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,800
what is happening

97
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,900
we have not only mapped the

98
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,510
argos cameras on the ground but identified what

99
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,620
the potential problems are

100
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,040
we start from the story at antonio's home

101
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,920
the story at antonio's home is a

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,590
very strange thing we take a part of the

103
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,150
site of the argos system that

104
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,280
displays the density and go to see the

105
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,020
source page and  so far nothing

106
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,030
strange at this point to facilitate

107
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,010
I go to search directly the string

108
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,340
antonio because I want to get to the point

109
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,800
ved  if there is a part of code for those who

110
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,410
knew google maps for a moment

111
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,510
there is a part of code that is commented on

112
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,660
this part of the code here

113
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,010
actually has a function that

114
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,750
has nothing to do with the case of antonio with

115
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,488
the argos system except the  local and

116
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:21,649
began to move away from venice

117
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,390
move away from venice and let's see where the

118
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,760
house is at antonio's house and the house

119
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,890
the woman is in rome and the

120
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,600
funny thing that if we go to interface

121
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,720
this coordinate with the telephone data

122
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,220
we also find the telephone number of

123
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,560
antonio antonio  it is probably the

124
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,570
director of the beta system srl that the

125
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,520
company that made the site of the

126
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,470
arbus system with everything in the speech

127
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,360
so probably a programmer has

128
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,730
put his house in the head and made some

129
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:52,040
jokes about it left there but now that

130
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,980
we have found antonio we find

131
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,730
ourselves  directly with hiv http

132
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,040
headers going to see what's

133
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,960
here I made a more homemade mode

134
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,240
Roman journal on this address yes

135
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,980
p  can find ml leaks with the coordinates

136
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,410
of all the objects detected by

137
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,390
the argos system no password so

138
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,270
direct in quiet xml with a lot

139
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,610
of camera number number of the many

140
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,430
traced gps coordinates and speed and so

141
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,600
far we have a good starting point

142
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,290


143
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,760
also because through a  Another

144
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,860
very simple request is to access the

145
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,780
images of the cameras that the site

146
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,790
shows and come cameras that the site

147
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,630
does not show you and therefore

148
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,040
all the coordinates are available there are no

149
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,230
non-informative signs and therefore there

150
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,390
is no reliability and for this we have

151
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,640
created the project automatic asthma

152
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,100
nation system of blood the activity is a

153
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,900
system that verifies the functioning of

154
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,870
argos that is a fairly

155
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,910
badass script rigorously done in dishes

156
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,250
that downloads data from the

157
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,890
argos system and individual anomaly

158
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,100
after which this script generates a video

159
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,630
and loads it  on youtube

160
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,160
obviously division we

161
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,200
only uploaded two because after a while it was a bit

162
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,090
u  n delirium what came out that is it

163
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,250
was a nice video in which to see all the

164
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:07,760
anomalies

165
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,220
but it is a voice that type repeats from

166
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,910
pumped in italy the veins this is a

167
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,360
part of the smurf co script that

168
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,100
runs on the eno server and you go and

169
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,380
watch that  which combines the argus and

170
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,650
takes the data from the xml lists site

171
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,140
but we see the status of the cameras

172
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,270
the output is a simple html page

173
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,430
visible with all the information of

174
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,320
each single camera these objects

175
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,660
here are the cameras

176
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,450
when they are pink it means that they are not

177
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,670
they work and therefore there are no data

178
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,030
or images of the in the dap xml and then here

179
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,120
we have the three boxes that indicate

180
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,200
the event when it happened for example

181
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,790
that the image was black when

182
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,770
the image was static or

183
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,820


184
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,190
the photo of the day was recycled  before or if it was

185
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,870
simply a working image

186
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,420
with all the percentages above 10

187
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,040
percent black it is given the nickname

188
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,430
of m gear so when there is 10

189
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,290
percent of the cases it finds  i that a black

190
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:13,200
is running or that a bit of xml is running

191
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,000
over time is practically says ml are

192
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,650
xml are taken in relation to the

193
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,870
position of the camera identified

194
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,760
the three slices here it moves which moves

195
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,730
here does not move males works does not

196
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,650
work comes  made a statistic among

197
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,510
other things it is a count that does not save

198
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,570
even a place because exactly it is

199
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,360
always superimposed and of course here

200
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,920
we also see the images of the

201
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,590
cameras that are old and therefore

202
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,270
we can still see some works that

203
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,620
are no longer

204
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,750
even one of the 2 of  night but

205
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,340
look here

206
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,990
what this halo is is the reflection of the

207
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,010
enlightened night king of the

208
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,930
camera so the camera

209
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,270
practically darkens by itself and

210
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,180
is unable to see what the hell is going on

211
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,030
before the restorations done

212
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,830
this summer it was like this since 2009

213
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,630
now it works but there are others

214
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,490
that have already broken and that

215
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,280
funny thing here we see others that have

216
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,560
gone let's say offline and then there is this

217
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,200
which of course very particular

218
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,820
because evidently when they pass to the

219
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,680
cars they can see the undines that

220
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,540
move the miles

221
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,340
also because I see no other solution

222
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,380
this just the canal does not even look at

223
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,680
it I think it is a

224
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,750
pilot project to see if ardoz can

225
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,460
also be used land  to

226
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,140
track people because I do not see for what

227
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,850
other reason there must be this

228
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,479
image on the site of the argos system

229
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,650
we continue and see other cameras

230
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,540
that have black this is practically

231
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,530
always black it creates problems the year

232
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,480
covered so it's okay it doesn't work

233
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,140
this starts having  of video disturbances

234
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,870
and this one works the rest is

235
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,450
offline you don't know

236
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,030
this is another one always off line the

237
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,850
central part and buoys does not work there

238
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,400
is no image there is no xml

239
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,840
the boats arrive there they disappear and  then they

240
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,380
reappear fantastic and then there is

241
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,870
also the talk that these were the

242
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,950
cameras that up to three months ago did not

243
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,840
work at this one  it wasn't there and this

244
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,270
one wasn't there to tell you if they had

245
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,150
been removed ago then there is one that has

246
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,310
been moved that this one has been

247
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,010
moved several times and of course in

248
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,850
this case it is appropriate to say it

249
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,830
because this is  a screen taken from

250
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,320
outside through the windows big

251
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,660
brother we are looking at you

252
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:57,350
and this was all clear and dry

253
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,640
the tutor system is its relative but the

254
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,890
tutor system goes to use the plates

255
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,140
probably to the same the same

256
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,220
problems on twitter on everything we

257
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,839
have not yet studied  nothing but

258
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,089
we are studying on another tutor that

259
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,760
I call tutor but he is a man on his own

260
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,250
who is also here in the area as

261
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,709
soon as you leave there are cameras that

262
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,930
are not red t they are not

263
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,209
speed cameras but so much so that as soon as you enter

264
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:39,160
you exit  from the village on raiuno on one side

265
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,350
one on the other that they read the license plate and

266
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,390
say mister rossi enters the village

267
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,410
then so and

268
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,170
so mister whites leaves this village to

269
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,269
that other now try to think about  uel little

270
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:50,890
program called between inserted

271
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,660
from one country to another that I had

272
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,180
cars is coming off the highways and

273
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,010
this is a problem we have

274
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,149
from 2010 to today this was the

275
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:03,670
very banal publication of what we

276
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,180
are

277
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:15,829
doing is certainly not there  the information

278
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:17,420
in fact the whole argos system is an

279
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,559
example of I put in suitable

280
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,129
information

281
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:21,259
so much so that for this reason here the

282
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:22,910
fines that were paid through the

283
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,529
argo system have been considered

284
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:26,899
valid both for this reason and also

285
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:28,459
for the fact that by regulation  of the

286
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:29,629
municipality of venice

287
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:31,249
the cameras cannot be used

288
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:32,899
to impose sanctions

289
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,629
so there is a legal problem with

290
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,759
argo not to mention the public data processing

291
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,279
for travel and

292
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,540
the fact that being an

293
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,579
experimental system going to search on

294
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,990
the public registers of the guarantor

295
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,569
we did not find the requests from

296
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:49,339
those who made argos for the

297
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:50,679
experimental system

298
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,790
plus it should c  idle with

299
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,970
the 2010 provision on

300
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,490
video surveillance because because to make

301
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,559
intelligent video surveillance

302
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,160
systems that track

303
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,290
movements, the part of the

304
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,369
people of the city to the

305
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:05,899
other requires the authorization of the guarantor they do

306
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,050
not have it

307
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,650
is in fact the and I believe that they do not  we

308
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,180
have done that there has not yet

309
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:26,340
been a situation but the

310
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,470
municipal ordinance can decide the fact that it

311
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,930
puts the cameras however you have to

312
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,490
see then the treatment that is

313
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,610
done

314
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,840
is an excellent question we spent one

315
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,610
million and 400 thousand euros for  this

316
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,500
system that was born to analyze the

317
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
traffic of the grand canal and notify

318
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,900
the traffic police in real time within 30

319
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,820
seconds that someone was

320
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,410
running somewhere so that they

321
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,210
went to make the fines then

322
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,520
subsequently on hydrates the more

323
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,800
advanced system they also did  the fine that

324
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,510
arrives in real time but who knows why

325
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,550
everyone is running and there is the telelaser

326
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,950
in the telelaser you tell yourself but it wasn't there

327
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,560
we have already seen this system that since

328
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,090
there is a boat the

329
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,070
reference point moves with respect to the

330
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,810
boat what ever measures

331
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,920
who knows how many meters per second we

332
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,380
can say kilometers per hour more or

333
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,680
less with 10 20 percent error

334
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,950
in fact the printouts and technical data of

335
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,589
argos that are public

336
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,720
speak of errors that depend

337
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,150
on the environmental conditions and in fact

338
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,620
our tests have shown that the

339
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,839
heroes are those and of course then

340
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,130
there have been many other

341
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,110
malfunctions of the system considering

342
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,580
that the cameras mount  a

343
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,570
celeron processor and they have a bit of a career

344
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,880
behind them are also a bit of March in some

345
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,330
cases no

346
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,240
I have seen them with the telelaser and they

347
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,210
keep coming to me photos of policemen

348
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,800
with telelaser there is a very

349
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,230
nice article on the plot there jorge point which is

350
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,090
entitled  laser sgamma

351
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,880
the photos that were sent to me by the

352
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,520
fighters with telelaser on the grand canal

353
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:21,970
as in fact but where there is argos both

354
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,560
now and then they want  expand it

355
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,420
using the discourse of being

356
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,230
tracked with gps there is the tattered wing in

357
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,910
order to realize that maybe they have

358
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,220
damaged the tatter a little

359
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,510
but they do things even more

360
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,000
absurd instead say ok we have spent

361
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,430
millions and 400 thousand euros for the

362
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:44,130
cabbages keep enlarging it I know

363
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:08,239
when he shows up with mum he practices

364
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:27,979
anyway enemies interventions if it is still very

365
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:29,809
strange because his hardware there is

366
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,839
a section that concerns taxis where if

367
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,369
you always go with dear old friend he

368
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:36,469
had it http heather finds out  that makes

369
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,079
temporary files with xml that if you

370
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,549
make the right request you download

371
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:43,399
everything in xml with the gps coordinates of the

372
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,199
stops name surname hours of work and

373
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,959
license number

374
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,159
so if you are a taxi driver you

375
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:49,549


376
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,319
can always do the application  for

377
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:54,709
iphone it tells you where it is or I want

378
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:57,379
that taxi driver wait until the show is there is

379
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:00,099
crazy it

380
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,919
is a system implemented by argos

381
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,740
the basic idea I think is that the

382
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,529
camera associates an i  d track to an object

383
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:20,060
for the duration of the

384
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,060
whole chase to the next boat from

385
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,720
there to the next truck in rotation

386
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,700
so that there are never 2d between them

387
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,920
and up to no

388
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,440
attention the other part there is an xml file

389
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,380
with  license number name surname of the

390
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,500
taxi driver gps coordinate what happens

391
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,330
if I see the boat leaving it

392
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,459
comes from those gps coordinates that

393
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:49,580
hook it but as with any

394
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,220
berth as with any transporter

395
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,220
as with any means is the

396
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,990
toy we used to  auto

397
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,060
track us and see if argos worked by

398
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,649
hooking up when you pass from one cell to

399
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,160
the other carabini valid coordinates and

400
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,040
live shores at a certain point is also a

401
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,929
random thing because then maybe you

402
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:14,089
change it if someone crosses it is not

403
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:17,980
really a perfect system

404
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,339
raving about life

405
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,959
no  absolutely no

406
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,490
this work i campani has never been used also

407
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,710
because it was published now yes there was

408
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,799
the speech there was the speech

409
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,530
on the cameras on  wide species among

410
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,660
etc. that probably someone will have

411
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,429
seen for sure but the fact

412
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,770
that they have clearly used it does

413
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,200
not appear to us for the mobs but that is

414
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:57,120
another story but in reality

415
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,919
the opposition has realized by itself

416
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:02,429
the judge of  peace they gave fines

417
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:04,230
to people to the judge I do everything

418
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,090
these fines are not valid because

419
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,460
argos does not respect the regulations the

420
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,390
laws and therefore enough in characters alone

421
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,150
then it turned out that in any case it was

422
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,929
like a lot of months of repair they did not

423
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:21,360
fix then yes  it broke they

424
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,520
blocked it but we certainly thought

425
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,580
ok they found us playing hide and seek

426
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,559
let's go and see the cameras I don't

427
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,240
operate how the city worked

428
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,490
another fun gem on

429
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,740
foggy days when there is a bit

430
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,059
of haze

431
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,860
if a boat passes by some

432
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,160
Argos cameras make a little

433
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,380
light turn on a kind of viewer of

434
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,880
some kind but it is visible to the naked eye

435
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,080


436
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,700
so there is this gem that we

437
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,640
discovered with

438
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,290
he will certainly have some from you but there will have

439
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,740
been many objections

440
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,750
I know that in any case I do not know if for argos or

441
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,040
for other reasons

442
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,050
last year among the voices of the municipality

443
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,910
there were 500 thousand euros of postage costs

444
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,480
of the fines not  paid and

445
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,570
that there were a mess of appeals then

446
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:16,520
know what you need to start

447
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,050
doing some instances of access to administrative documents if you

448
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,990
tie it up and in any

449
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,140
case 86 advisors are those 5 6 euros of

450
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,420
shipping the fine you pay when you

451
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,790
pay the fines so probably  there is

452
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,860
something interrupted in May

453
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,540
probably that of taxi drivers and

454
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:40,190
consortia or something like that so bonda I would

455
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,870
move on to the next north
