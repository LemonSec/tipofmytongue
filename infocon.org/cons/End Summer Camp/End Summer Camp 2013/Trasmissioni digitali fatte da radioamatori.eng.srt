1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,630
every now

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,510
and then it is this that I least want to

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,210
hear it

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,140
as if to say you after which it

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,180
was the first digital broadcast

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,349
ever the prize I do not say now it

7
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:27,660
will be after it will still be delivered by

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,650
Mr. but this is here therefore to us

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,120
it is interesting to know what was the first

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,190
digital transmission ever that

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,489
happened hides the prize found before

12
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:43,470
then there are various various

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,040
digital transmission systems that were born

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,899
some were born in the

15
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,920
amateur radio field and then they also came out

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,000
in the commercial field

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,629
some were born in the field  more

18
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,670


19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,489
or less military they entered the amateur field when they became more or

20
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,039
less known the functioning became known

21
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,290
let's say we have

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,240
systems I put here radio wand

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,340
in reality pac and the radio pacto are more

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,900
or less the same thing

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,950
then there is these  these fascist sorry

26
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,500
these transmission systems that

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,329
we will see in one born for nuxis for a

28
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:23,779
different use

29
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,530
these here not a tip  that is

30
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,310
said to many in many tones while these

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,350
on a single tone the idea is to

32
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,960
be able to communicate on a radio channel

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,830
so the classic radio you have

34
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,730
because if you are a radio operator you have

35
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,620
a radio at home is the only possibility

36
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,330
you have  to communicate with another

37
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,770
person the microphone so when you

38
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,140
speak someone hears you so the only

39
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,580
thing a radio can do and

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,740
transmit voice sounds

41
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,080
digital transmissions in fact use sounds to

42
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,280
transmit so there is a certain

43
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,770
sequence of sounds  that is decoded

44
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,810
on the other side this encoding

45
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,930
is received and

46
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,100
practically translated into bits

47
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,070
so every time we decide with

48
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,730
tone it is worth a bit or in any case a sequence

49
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,700
of tones is worth a beat upon reception

50
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,650
we have the same sequence so we are

51
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,660
interested in knowing how to distinguish  substance

52
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,260
what is zero what is one ultimately

53
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,220
therefore the purpose of

54
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,720
digital transmission another than to create a system

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,709
to succeed  distinguish 0 and 1 so

56
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,040
already here you may already have the answer

57
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,519
to the question I initially asked

58
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,080
as I said before in the material field if they

59
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,380
are different needs because you know they

60
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,440
are radio amateurs or to explain it

61
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,590
surprise I said that it was born for

62
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,530
different needs because the radio operators

63
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,570
have different meanwhile  frequencies

64
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,090
ranging from a few mega so a little

65
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,970
above the radio me they end up on the

66
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,700
giga so a lot above the satellites

67
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,550
because they arrive they do tests even at 76

68
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,459
gb 15 is the last one I saw the

69
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,209
2nd 76 giga so they go from 76 giga to the

70
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,570
killers  therefore they are have a whole

71
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,000
series of frequency slices that are that

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,670
range practically on the whole

73
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,920
usable frequency all the

74
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,269
radiofrequency every frequency of the

75
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,640
advantages and disadvantages

76
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,980
there are those who have atmospheric noise who instead

77
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,360
has

78
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,960
an optical visibility for which more

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,490
bipolar from resembles  very laser

80
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,700
so microwaves tend to have

81
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,460
an optical trend if you put a

82
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,880
wall in front of it, you don't  go behind even if they

83
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,740
keep saying that the waves that

84
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,560
pass the concrete wall is not like that it

85
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,420
will be enough for cell phones to try going

86
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,050
inside the bunker so there are different

87
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,440
frequencies there is propagation

88
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,730
fast propagation is what

89
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,820
allows for example this morning from

90
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,640
there  we listened to the Australians on the

91
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,530
patient on the frequency of 14 mag a

92
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,860
it is not that the wave went directly to

93
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,169
australia but the wave was reflected in the

94
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:35,360
sky reflected in the sea or in the earth it

95
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,360
returned in the sky until it

96
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,840
zigzagged up to australia the bounce on the

97
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,290
sky is not given it is not a constant thing it

98
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,830
is given by various factors among which we say

99
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,270
that it depends a lot on the ionization

100
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,910
to the limitation substantially

101
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,010
allows the reflection of the wave the more

102
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,050
the ionized area and the more the waves are

103
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,720
reflected the better the less ionized and the more

104
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,970
the wave  tends to pass out so if

105
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,530
there is no limitation and your

106
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,229
waves end up in the

107
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,240
socialization space, the

108
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,470
realization depends on  de from various factors

109
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,710
including sunspots the sun there is a

110
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,720
difference between days in the night

111
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,970
etc. etc. for that night there is

112
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,700
less ionization during

113
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,240
the day there is more these factors it is

114
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,710
logical that you must be careful because

115
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,150
for example here it can  being day

116
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,880
on the other side there is night so these

117
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,730
hours the factors mean that at this

118
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,170
moment it is not possible to talk

119
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,230
to australia tomorrow morning until 9

120
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,710
the exit for needle australia this

121
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,600
winter maybe not because in winter

122
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,460
cameron  other citations other frequencies

123
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,180
are usable others not so the

124
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,760
propagation varies according to the months

125
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,040
of the sunspot days and

126
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,560
a whole series of factors which is also

127
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,030
interesting because if every day

128
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,210
you can connect Australia with the crests, it

129
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,580
also loses interest because the facts

130
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,860
all the states in a month you have

131
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,430
finished enjoying them there are also some very

132
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,470
short duration programs that

133
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,910
we see after it is called weather scatter

134
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,650
which practically uses the

135
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,810
ions  ization that occurs for a few

136
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,850
thousandths of a second and a few seconds

137
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,880
when the motor falls in the sky that

138
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,500
you see one every now and then but in reality a

139
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,720
lot of them fall during the day and

140
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,030
ionize the air for a few short

141
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,040
moments so there is a

142
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,170
digital communication that is  made on purpose to

143
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,940
communicate within a radius of two three thousand

144
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,250
kilometers with frequencies that

145
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,840
are usually imported optics and therefore do not do

146
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,590
more than 2,300 km 400 500 you manage to do

147
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,980
those 22,000 2,000 and 2,500 kilometers

148
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:53,530
digitally the noise I said even before

149
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,470
there is noise  step motor pass discharge

150
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,350
said no

151
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,300
noise

152
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,909
even discharges say of lightning

153
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:04,819
etc. etc. they induce noise

154
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:08,190
that interferes in

155
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,199
digital communication so some communications

156
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,479
are made for noise interference

157
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,650
or as little

158
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,430
doppler as possible there is one of the communications

159
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,190
we have after using an im  leap

160
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,169
that always exists every now and then at least

161
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:26,400
once every 28 days

162
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,139
no 15 days every 28 that  it is the moon for

163
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,030
which you transmit to the moon bounces

164
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,949
on the moon it ends up in america

165
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:36,659
Rome yesterday carispo transmits it to the

166
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,219
moon and you then you manage to

167
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:41,580
parry with the doctor using the moon

168
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,969
as a bounce which is called m

169
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:47,180
you will say impossible stuff reality

170
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,830
It is very feasible to have here a

171
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,370
communication method that allows

172
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,039
this the problem is that the moon

173
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,879
moves moving the moon I know if you have ever

174
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,770
heard when a train arrives that the

175
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,440
low noise then passes then always

176
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,800
goes backwards it is low goes up

177
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,930
because the frequency sun sun

178
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,960
moving object is variable so

179
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,340
sweet reality transmit on a

180
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,460
frequency that is one thousand towards the moon the

181
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,050
moon is moving away is

182
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,420
approaching the frequency varies up and

183
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,360
down according to the cases for which the

184
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,340
digital mode can  to recover and

185
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,260
adapt to this difference that in the

186
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,049
fact that it is called the doppler effect

187
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,070
therefore some worlds in Italy

188
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,200
automatically have the ability to understand

189
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,840
the reason there is an excuse to understand the doppler

190
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,130
and to follow it fluctuations as I said

191
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,600
before the realization is not constant it

192
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,090
can vary so you have a signal that

193
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,460
comes as a strong intensity then drops then

194
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,370
goes up and then goes down some times it is slow

195
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,020
some times and fast  it depends on

196
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,090
the atmospheric conditions from the sun by

197
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,400
usual things for which there are

198
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,810
fluctuations as I said before how it

199
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,370
works digitally and there are

200
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,970
questions so far

201
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,290
one

202
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:19,160
is in fact the doc effect but you have to focus

203
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,449
on the moon to provide

204
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,920
the there are different types of  modulation

205
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,750
what is modulation if you go to

206
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,750
listen to a digital broadcast in

207
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,440
this case

208
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,760
you hear a tone or rather you hear a tone

209
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,860
that varies that is mentioned for which a

210
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,720
tone that in miller if a tone that at 2,000

211
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,110
and 1,000 corresponds to a beat 0  2

212
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,250
thousand they correspond to another bit

213
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,620
the sequence of these bits second de

214
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,010
sorry if with these tones following the

215
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,990
bits it does nothing but carry out the

216
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,500
digital transmission

217
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,750
the other is the m  ulti you think instead of

218
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,020
having a frequency that varies here there

219
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,200
are tones of tones ranging from 16 32 tones

220
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,110
64 tones that are sent the facts here

221
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,820
feel all born it seems sometimes

222
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,160
some songs had sayings all

223
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,830
of all because it is a whole series of

224
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,190
tones that are transmitted later we will have

225
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,960
one from what is made that was born for

226
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,580
speech moon that is now also used

227
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,920
in hf that allows communications

228
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,850
even with america with 5 watts that

229
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,370
uses this type of tones that

230
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,050
you go to listen on the radio heard

231
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,720
all of them seem like a child who

232
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,480
is playing randomly on a

233
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,480
keyboard

234
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,310
then there is another one that is

235
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,190
interesting that I like everyone among

236
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,200
all but in general the one

237
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,100
I like

238
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,440
best actually transmits only one tone has

239
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,750
changed you know that when you send  a

240
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,580
tone I do not know for miller if this another

241
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,170
than a thousand sinusoid in a second

242
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,880
and what happens every time the

243
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,310
sinusoid is reciprocated therefore out of

244
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,170
phase every time there is a change  or of

245
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,450
bits so if there is a 11 0

246
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,210
the first is like this the second is like this because

247
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,460
there is another 1 the zero should go up

248
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,550
no back down is out of phase by 180

249
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,250
degrees so the wave is

250
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,410
out of phase by 180  degrees

251
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,420
the receiver is able to see

252
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,280
whenever there is a 180 degree phase shift

253
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,800
and is able to understand when there is

254
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,330
a beatbox variation at the beginning it

255
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,520
had one becomes 0 if before it had zero it

256
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,560
becomes one naturally the start of

257
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,450
transmission  it is coded so it knows

258
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,790
what is at the beginning that rightly

259
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,590
on who is able to understand only the

260
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,960
phase shift then the bit change but

261
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,850
not the beat at the beginning must start with

262
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,280
zero for example otherwise no one

263
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,570
can understand this  it is the phase shift

264
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,890
keying for which there is the phase shift

265
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:09,720
of the wave of the miss questions then

266
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,130
the fs k or the fsk difference that it is the

267
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,280
radio that does the shift or the

268
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,100
audio tone once modems were used

269
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,230
now in reality if they can

270
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,910
absolutely accomplished  powerful that reality is

271
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,290
used the sch  eda computer audio to

272
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,770
make these types of transmissions

273
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,820
for which you attach the sound card

274
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,070
the speaker output on the microphone

275
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,830
with special adapters because the

276
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,860
signal must be correct and

277
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,360
the radio speaker output connected

278
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,070
to the microphone input on the

279
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,540
sound card  at the line input in the

280
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,280
sound card of the computer installed the

281
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,670
software you do not have to do anything else on the

282
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,800
contrary if you just want to receive wide just

283
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,180
take the headphone output of the

284
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,500
radio stick it on

285
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,270
the computer audio fat

286
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,210
you do not have to do anything else the package was the radio

287
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,890
is what  let's say it started in fact

288
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,180
first of all in this the

289
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,130
Greek income I do not know if you have ever seen on

290
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,390
some old films that conceals

291
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,029
teletypewriter who writes this is the

292
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,520
same thing the difference that via

293
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,520
radio encodes the tones that were

294
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,490
transmitted via telephone in this case

295
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,670
they are worn in fact it was

296
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,990
called tape

297
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,870
yes this is goodbye tele tape was

298
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,400
on the joint the r

299
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,910
in essence they are  two tones a building

300
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,000
mark and a space not 0 1 but in any case it is the

301
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,370
same a series of marks and spaces

302
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,400
make an encoding of a character for

303
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,740
which and you see written there is no

304
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,720
error correction so if a finger

305
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,029
is a  tone is misunderstood

306
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:52,250
you see the wrong letter

307
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,300
exact

308
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,700
exact is at 5 exact

309
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,500
radio wand or is

310
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,620
substantially divided into a protocol

311
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,940
called x25 which takes up leaks 25 that

312
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,520
existed real exists that never existed

313
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:23,250
in the digital realm that no

314
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,870
protocol that I don't know  if you have ever seen

315
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:34,410
what the first vbs was called no the one

316
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,310
made by telecom that you entered at 1200

317
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:43,110
bode and will give the knicks 25 no and the one who

318
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,160
wrote nothing and was called

319
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,360
committed nothing and automatically

320
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,590
entered and was called no oh well later

321
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,080
comes in  mind name that an old

322
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,760
protocol that was born for computer networks

323
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,590
and that was brought

324
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,990
inside essentially every

325
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,400
delicate station by its own call sign

326
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,130
so I am 23 wounded and I want to

327
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,070
connect with  n product the grain trembles

328
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,530
I see it could hurt he connects in those

329
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,920
days when I'm talking about the years 92

330
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,640
90 92 there were really dbs so

331
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,380
you write a message to a Frenchman

332
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,450
he a little at a time talking to a

333
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,730
computer the time he managed  to send

334
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,160
messages of a slowness for which it

335
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,930
took a day before an

336
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,250
email arrives in three seconds if there were

337
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,840
a whole series of bbs that create

338
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,910
the bds that

339
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,860
were there in those days with the only modem

340
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,780
they have corresponded very much  made via radio advantage

341
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,030
of the radios and that did not pay you you did not

342
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,100
pay tele with substances that at that time

343
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,770
cost exactly so there was the

344
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,510
transposition substantially the bbs

345
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,290
made via telephone modem on the radio that

346
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,720
was very much liked and they

347
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,780
also transported the tpp tcp ip

348
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,670
basically that I where learned

349
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,710
looting because the advantage of that

350
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,990
time is that even now if you do it is

351
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,950
that at 1200 mouse or at 9,600 baud it

352
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,690
means that I don't know you know what person

353
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,390
tcp connections  ip serve land sheikh and

354
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,840
for which you see the package

355
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,780
I find it amanda la ck la ck plus lilo you

356
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,670
saw going to video one at a time

357
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,270
and for which to learn even if you did not want to

358
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,130
because there you knew all three packages

359
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,080
because everything was much slower  that it was

360
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,810
a bummer

361
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,090
if you have to download a software but

362
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,430
that time and soft were small but

363
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,890
they became interesting to

364
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,950
learn why you were routing between everything

365
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,740
and everyone since the ip encoding

366
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,860
went to see the class 44 is assigned

367
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,920
to the rowers then they were there  i know 44 point

368
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,100
i'm shooting at random 172 60 60 gr

369
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,370
fiuli venezia giulia 61 del veneto 62 63

370
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,140
was emilia romagna

371
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,760
so all that had them 61

372
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,700
then you did them routine you said 61

373
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,920
emilia romagna and when a

374
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,630
package came from i don't know from trentino  and that it

375
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,270
went towards Romagna it turned it

376
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,310
correctly so it is secondary to wings and

377
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,829
where I learned routing well because it was

378
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,140
very slow to be able to see now

379
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,240
even if you are wrong and useful participles  dump

380
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,400
and then scroll what happened

381
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,839
because 8 billion packets have passed

382
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,770
per second

383
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,059
the prs is nothing more than the positioning

384
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:41,710
is a system for which it encodes your

385
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,150
gps coordinates situation of the time here is

386
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,350
the information and constantly sends it

387
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,850
to a centralized system

388
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,270
indeed  it is not a centralized

389
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,940
system of nodes that distributes this

390
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,780
information

391
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,550
if you go to see aprs in map in on

392
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,920
google there are some maps where

393
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,540
you see the coach who is running in the car

394
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,309
and he tells me the position of

395
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:07,900
where he sees all the  breeders who

396
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,160
are going by car at

397
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,470
that moment or who have positioned

398
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,970
that have the temperature sensor

399
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,340
you see the temperature that there is his house

400
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,630
surely they had never found

401
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,220
interesting but maybe someone

402
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,740
likes it used if there were the car

403
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,050
you know where the  thief enough

404
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:32,980
all of this I said before at the

405
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,450
speed of 45 so you see

406
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,340
directors who had like at a time dropped

407
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,830
you saw it on which in reality when

408
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,540
they saw it television it is commercials and

409
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,100
commercials went faster they gave 2

410
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,750
300 character minutes you will see it written

411
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,970
here and you see a character that is written

412
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,679
one every now and then and you see that the

413
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:52,210
name of the person who says I

414
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,840
am is formed  gino pippo the coding used the

415
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,309
bordeaux as he said but they are

416
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:00,370
already there so it is also to use let if you use

417
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,080
let but every time but that it is always

418
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,540
available to therefore it is still used

419
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,780
in if you go this this system

420
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,940
via radio still used for

421
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,370
information  for example weather for

422
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,670
ships

423
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,100
once in my time there were also

424
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,410
the news agency

425
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,120
now I don't know if it still exists and there is

426
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,640
internet but the tubes you have to go to its

427
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,100
channels on the commercial frequencies of the

428
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,020
newspapers of the news agencies you

429
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,050
saw not only  the one there of the

430
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,160
African you saw all the news of

431
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,710
Africa and there was one the second

432
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,590
with dead wars then in the evening from the

433
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,090
news I hope that q  hen you heard

434
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:52,830
nothing so it was interesting the

435
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,570
formations have a lot then they

436
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,370
were screened a lot in the newspaper not so

437
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,100
even if it will be a war in

438
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,210
somalia usually in the newspaper then on the

439
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,620
news you did not hear anything

440
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:37,480
you saw only number only letter and

441
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,990
even now so also the passage from

442
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,330
uppercase lowercase is a now

443
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,460
uppercase step and protection that changed the

444
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,169
encoding so I don't know 0 0 1 in

445
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:52,350
numeric it is one in characters valley has

446
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,970
a character but if you lose lucky I

447
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,899
change so now I switch to numbers to you

448
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:01,809
saw letters I did not understand why they were

449
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:03,990
all

450
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:11,379
so this here now we see the ones

451
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:12,940
that are multi-frequency those I was saying

452
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,109
before that it seems like a

453
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:20,679
child playing one is called olivia do not

454
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,269
ask me the name where it comes from I assume it

455
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:24,009
will be the daughter of the one who complained

456
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:27,249
was born in 2003 it became a standard

457
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:30,969
2005  it is suitable early in hf so

458
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:33,789
the frequency between 30 30 megs and with

459
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:36,070
multi pad multi pattern practically in

460
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,159
hf so  no all connections

461
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,289
many pact it means that the wave

462
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:43,089
bounces on the sky remained on the earth in the

463
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:46,089
mother it happens if it sends multiple times and multi

464
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:50,559
path decodes signals up to 14 dbd

465
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,429
signal noise

466
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:54,009
I can ensure so said in the noise and

467
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,779
hear 1 speak under you do not understand

468
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:58,289
nothing

469
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,339
this modification is also the ones we

470
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:04,450
see later you have heard a

471
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,519
signal at that level there means that

472
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,889
if you put the headphones on you do not hear anything

473
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:11,799
you actually hear he is

474
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,019
decoding so it goes far below

475
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:15,399
what the human ear can

476
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:18,460
hear to encode in fact  the first

477
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,859
time i put it said there is nothing here

478
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:26,440
and after it appeared instead call sign they use

479
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,629
encoding that is called when you see

480
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:31,059
olivia they record us sor 16 bar and a

481
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,929
number 16 the number of tones while the

482
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:36,539
ypsilon the one after and bandwidth

483
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:39,129
more information  you transmit at the

484
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:41,859
same time the more you have the chance

485
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:45,249
that it will be wrong and the more

486
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:46,419
bandwidth you use

487
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:48,460
just see now when you use  the wifi

488
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,570
how do you do

489
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,240
not that 54 the one before 10 megabits

490
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,470
was much less wide used much less

491
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,340
mega than the one that uses the 54 in 54 on

492
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,370
two channels of the old you say because it is not

493
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:12,040
able to transmit in two with stops

494
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,740
three yes two and a half  because it is not able

495
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,270
to it is not that they know greater bandwidth

496
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,790
because it is also quite logical if

497
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,100
you want if you want to transmit more

498
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,720
information and things are bigger and

499
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,310
therefore of the tube bigger and therefore

500
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,990
bandwidth is the tube of the radio

501
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,180
then more width  of aceh band is the more

502
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,210
tones you transmit and the more tendentially it

503
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,370
goes into error it is more possible but

504
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,010
managed to transmit more information

505
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,690
so if you see writing see

506
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:49,040
writing faster it does not manage it

507
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,580
in the sense that when a

508
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,670
multipath frequency arrives it is received

509
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,010
with signals that  they are neither constant nor

510
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:03,350
variable because when I do in the multi

511
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,780
path we make the example that you go

512
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,310
inside you have never been to

513
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,560
St. Peter's basilica when you go up  at the

514
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,260
top the echoes for kuyt arrive and I'm

515
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,850
talking to you my voice reaches you

516
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,950
now because it is direct point and rivas the

517
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,390
one that makes a reflection that goes to

518
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,190
bounce that does the whole dome

519
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,170
comes to you from above and arrives late

520
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,450
because it did  more path and then you

521
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,160
get the other that has passed on the

522
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,770
corner beyond which is however less than this as a

523
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,200
path so it had before so

524
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,060
this is my direct immediately a

525
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,340
few milliseconds to the other and a few

526
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,520
milliseconds later the other arrives

527
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,840
ethical confusion because I'm

528
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,970
saying hello and you maybe your brain

529
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,860
can recognize the two but the tones that

530
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,570
are of four frequencies for example and

531
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,100
you get 123 how do you

532
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,490
distinguish which was the one there

533
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,830
or it was my direct then him

534
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,680
able to manage multipath with

535
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,930
algorithms for which I can understand if

536
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,750
that tone is reality because the Latvian sequence is

537
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,330
an algorithm for which

538
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,660
a tone of that same type cannot arrive in

539
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,370
those seconds in that mill  th of a

540
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,530
second must arrive after hicks

541
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,930
then understood a sequence to an algorithm on the

542
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,480
able to understand if in tone it is also my

543
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,120
reflection for it is the third inflection that

544
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,479
comes to me

545
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,670
now not livia I have never used so

546
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,010
I don't know how to tell you  this that agents 65

547
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:39,000
yes to the error correction this

548
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,020
looks like riva da olivia in reality it was

549
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,460
born for the mcqueen of transmission via the

550
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,110
moon in reality then there is an improvement

551
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:50,850
that what we see later and is instead

552
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,090
now very used also in hf usually

553
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,890
chi  use this one uses transmissions

554
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,070
between 5 and 30 watts fi all over europe without

555
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,100
problems with frequent if there is

556
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,840
approval do all the world without

557
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,330
using high powers because it has a

558
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,660
level of able to decode many

559
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,340
of b under lemon this is what  I

560
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,810
tried that time I the first

561
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,520
time I tried I felt

562
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,280
absolutely nothing below and he decodes

563
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,780
values I'm 34 now I have to therefore it is suitable

564
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,250
for weak signals even the age

565
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,170
variable mind I have to say the moon s  i shifts

566
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,790
for which it varies in frequency he is able

567
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,170
to follow therefore suitable for

568
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,520
decoding lemme I said as before many of

569
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,870
experienced noise to an error correction

570
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,080
and then if you see callsign it is one

571
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,750
hundred percent right so either you see or you don't

572
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,410
see the transmission works  so

573
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,660
first of all you must of the computer that

574
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,630
is connected with an antique the

575
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,850
precise clock then it must be

576
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,400
synchronized because the communication

577
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,980
always starts at 00 of the minute

578
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,110
so you put in exception of the 0

579
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,480
0 of the minute begins to encode the

580
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,210
transmission lasts 47 seconds  about 46.0

581
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,670
we go back to 47 then 47 seconds later

582
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,700
he takes a few seconds he shows you the

583
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,790
callsigns demonstrates targets that

584
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,650
are already making a connection

585
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,640
so those

586
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,380
allows you to connect those who

587
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,150
are making a call veils shows

588
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,250
in green and shows me this call sign

589
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,510
this  callsign this moment

590
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,610
click on what you have 10 seconds

591
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,150
to do it 13 seconds to do it for  because

592
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,240
at 00 starts transmission in this

593
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,670
case a transmission in which you have

594
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,710
listened even in the even minutes you will

595
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,700
transmit in the odd number because at that

596
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,900
point it starts your

597
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,660
transmission which was supposed to 47 seconds and he

598
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,950
will have 13 seconds to go and put

599
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,380
what you want and  very boring because

600
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,790
between the transmission and reception of the

601
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,500
regionalization pass to 45

602
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,110
dry minutes of which 47 seconds is the

603
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,360
casper da of the transmission so it is

604
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,700
very slow but actually I

605
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,560
did it communications with

606
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,480
noise levels that I did not hear anything

607
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,060
the antenna out there  on the terrace with seven

608
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,270
meters of red thread what I am

609
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,400
out there on that adapter on the

610
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,680
terrace thrown like this and I communicated

611
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:25,230
with all of Europe use 65 tones so

612
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,240
heard and the jingle like if

613
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,160
you want from avola make you hear hear the

614
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,960
jingle this that  what I want to

615
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,960
try soon but the antenna is missing

616
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,240
on the uses the weather shot and I said

617
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,680
before that it has the transmission of pri  but at

618
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,260
47 seconds and transmit 13 cured

619
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:55,178
47 seconds to transmit 13 characters

620
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:04,220
this here is the exact same thing

621
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,799
except that it uses the

622
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,929
ionization is due from when the

623
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:12,919
meteors enter the space

624
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,679
they enter the atmosphere ionize the threshing floor

625
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,330
between a few milliseconds and  a few seconds

626
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,789
it has even reached 23 seconds in

627
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:25,940
that meantime the wave is reflected at

628
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,039
even high frequencies including those

629
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:30,169
that from now on not being land 44 30

630
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:32,480
let's say that in reality and are 194

631
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,059
as 30 very difficult because

632
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:37,130
usually that frequency  the wave goes

633
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:40,220
straight away there was towards space what

634
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,240
happens in which voice transmissions I

635
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,150
challenge you in 300 milliseconds to say

636
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,130
your name you can also say it

637
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,950
but it took you more than 200 300m

638
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,669
seconds

639
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:56,090
the hunt for the jersey then this

640
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,130
transmission has  made on purpose only

641
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,320
to use these breakthroughs of a second it

642
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,030
works the same way as before one

643
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,400
minute doing odd minute transmits a

644
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,590
series of packets  in which the information

645
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,620
is within 100 milliseconds

646
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,450
sooner or later in a minute you have to hope

647
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,860
that the meteor

648
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,340
I can guarantee that in the periods in which

649
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,990
they say that there are three of the 30 to the

650
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,820
60 matteo real minute it is true you do not see them

651
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,030
however c  'it is because you see them peaks but you

652
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,340
start software and even an antenna you see

653
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,700
peaks because an echo occurs so

654
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,000
you see lecco so there are no

655
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,500
minute there is definitely a meteor that

656
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,260
enters and the communication is like this for

657
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,270
which minutes  odd 1 even minutes the other

658
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,190
the difference is that the information in

659
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,250
this case is very small and very

660
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,919
fast but it is sent many times in

661
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:50,750
a minute so it is hoped that at that

662
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,130
moment the other will receive

663
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,340
he correctly said he could for a  minute

664
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,000
of chavez and is able to understand the

665
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
correctness of

666
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,750
the data this here is so much 441 baud

667
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,880
so the information is very complex

668
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,910
and a lot because it is an

669
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,310
amateur communication useful information happens

670
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,710
my name your  nominative is the

671
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,570
ratio the ratio of the

672
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,140
signal level which in this case is always 59

673
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,380
regardless of in reality

674
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,660
the method used is not used

675
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,660
as under the noise as a ratio

676
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,910
on the other side you do not pass them the 59 but

677
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:36,210
the under noise is passed  if it

678
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,840
was because it is more interesting as a

679
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,390
level so I don't know see less 17 say

680
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:46,020
dear 17 debby under noise that the

681
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,620
one I did

682
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:54,090
the first one in fact a style a cabbage the

683
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,250
ps cup what I was saying before because you can

684
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:56,850
see

685
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,120
oh well it's a phase change and  what

686
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,920
I said before is used and and not

687
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,460
error correction transmits 31 baud I

688
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,580
know you are for which to hear 31 baudo

689
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,520
di fa come let's say that it looks a

690
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,080
lot like the Greek tax code as a

691
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,540
sense that you see being written as

692
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,730
it is sent because  they give it

693
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,190
would be we use it with macros it

694
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,810
means that if you do not give preset words we

695
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,870
press f1 write one

696
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,580
thing we open even two years I write

697
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,200
born automatically in r  reality would be made

698
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,760
to write by hand that is it was born for

699
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,230
the idea of writing by hand do the

700
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,090
ideal speed for someone who writes

701
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,950
quickly on the keyboard at that

702
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,340
speed of more or less is very small

703
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,610
of bandwidth is the protocol that consumes

704
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:48,120
the least possible bandwidth  because it is

705
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,640
around 30 hearts it means that it

706
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,800
consumes 30s it means that when we

707
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,880
talk we

708
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,730
recommend 3 kilohertz 3000 hearts it

709
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,230
means that there are a thousand communications

710
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,940
of that type

711
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,770
sorry a hundred communications of that type

712
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,830
within the same channel where

713
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:09,480
we speak because 30  hearts we exaggerate

714
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,659
because 180 communications because there

715
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:16,859
are three in the third so

716
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:19,019
many simultaneous communications succeed where

717
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:20,940
we in that channel can only have

718
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,169
a voice communication so to a

719
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,639
very small consumption suitable for

720
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:31,249
any type of communication hf vhf

721
00:33:31,249 --> 00:33:34,229
the only interesting thing is that a

722
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:34,889
cod varies

723
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:36,929
so what is it that said the one

724
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:39,450
who invented it I do not associate as you leave

725
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,509
7 as to ac that 8  bit always that

726
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:44,849
in fact always breaks the bales sorry 7

727
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:45,210
bit

728
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,239
here is difficulty skiing at its fixed 7 bit

729
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:50,669
defends the character he told me but it is in

730
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:52,109
an island from material

731
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:54,119
which characters are used the most and

732
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:59,220
depending on the characters vary from 3 to  7

733
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,769
depending on the type for which the

734
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:04,139
most used characters are encoded

735
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:06,419
so the only thing that distinguishes, look at the

736
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,299
other 0 0 that a space in the

737
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,969
space 00 for which they have encoding which is

738
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,799
called varia code for which the

739
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:15,629
most used characters have a  smaller code

740
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:17,639
the less used characters in a longer bic code

741
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,129
so if you use the shorter ones

742
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:22,049
and the transmission theoretically

743
00:34:22,049 --> 00:34:23,699
appears it changes among other things it is not

744
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:26,210
faster but

745
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:35,569
yes exact as a vice where the is a point

746
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:38,849
I don't know is the titled ze tata  son four

747
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:48,268
or 5 on the exact 59 psk 31

748
00:34:48,268 --> 00:34:50,489
transmits three baudo tours then at 30 40

749
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:54,210
m of bandwidth 63 transmits 63

750
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:58,020
baud bandwidth around 80

751
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,020
and 125 even larger I go back to 200

752
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,770
hearts 180 200 h  earts naturally the more

753
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,960
you go up the more likely

754
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,940
the error will occur,

755
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,820
however this decoding

756
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,700
theoretically slightly less than the bite

757
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,560
of the morse code that what you

758
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,310
hear is one of the lowest at

759
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,180
ear level there are two others in reality there

760
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,220
are others decode  very little use

761
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,750
a being a tv series which is the

762
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,990
transmission of images that would be

763
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,940
slow scan television is a transmission

764
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,910
for which every tone anna do not come back

765
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,220
ranging from a thousand to two thousand where a thousand

766
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,780
looks a lot like the fax in fact they

767
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,400
look like a thousand and black 2000 and white

768
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,920
sst away more information where he

769
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,440
adds the color part for which you see

770
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,780
that a color image is formed in

771
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,150
which there is the person is written name you

772
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,520
answer him is another than a

773
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,810
software that does nothing but create

774
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,820
images that you have decided

775
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,670
like last time there was a woman leave

776
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,850
where your name is written and she

777
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,160
was calling as a name so

778
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,140
you see I don't like it much  to bene

779
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,590
did not find the usefulness words is so fax and

780
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,370
the same thing

781
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,340
and fax is still used in the hf field

782
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,160
that for ships the

783
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,850
weather maps are transmitted the maps with the

784
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,560
positions of the isobars those

785
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,570
you usually see television are

786
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:37,890
constantly transmitted type from  an English site

787
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,559


788
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:42,709
where it transmits this information in hf

789
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:44,420
for example there is also the

790
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,999
digital transmission of I don't know if you have ever

791
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:49,279
seen clocks that synchronize

792
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:52,509
themselves that is done in hf indeed it would

793
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:58,099
be if exact that at 75 kg it would not actually

794
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:00,589
be  a de hf would be the

795
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:07,339
lowest test well I am now among black

796
00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:09,349
tamers I would like to as many as they too

797
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:10,549
because not everyone knows what is the

798
00:37:10,549 --> 00:37:12,199
first digital transmission ever

799
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:15,579
according to you that was made

800
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:20,170
who is it that said mons if it is the

801
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,479
code bite  morse is in

802
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:25,880
full digital transmission because a key

803
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,529
down 0 key up the point the

804
00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:32,390
line is nothing more than an encoding in which

805
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:37,910
33 consecutive points are a line  if

806
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:42,529
you go to see one that goes down three points

807
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:44,719
and goes down it is a square wave and it is a

808
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:45,709
transmission of all

809
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:48,499
digital effects where it is nothing but key down

810
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,989
and key up the advantage is that the

811
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:57,890
decoding is human so the evil you have

812
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,469
won a kiss in the mouth from evil

813
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:03,380
I did not say it before because otherwise no one

814
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,559
knew how to answer it is

815
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,959
actually the morse code that

816
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:10,760


817
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,330
was called cw in the native world is the first

818
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,040
ever digital transmission so

819
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,480
the first transmission was not in

820
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,390
analog functional analogue in reality,

821
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,610
however, is digital from a technical point of view

822
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,210
,

823
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,490
therefore decoding is digital in all respects

824
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:32,420
and human to why it did not

825
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,010
yet know very much used by

826
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,680
radio amateurs the digital transmission

827
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,270
sorry for the transmission morse code cw

828
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,890
and it is also one of the most interesting

829
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,460
because  it is the one that allows you to reach

830
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,800
very low teaching levels without

831
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,260
using the computer so

832
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,880
human decoding can be used so let's say

833
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,010
computers an  that for that part there, however,

834
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,610
some speeds as the manipulation

835
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:03,350
in some cases varies a lot because there are

836
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,940
those who use the key in the true sense of the

837
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,080
word the classic one

838
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,150
there are those who use the one with double vanes

839
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,590
blind the one who uses the a key the

840
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,650
how  it is called the timing gives it the

841
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,110
arm the human person then

842
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,210
the human ear is able to keep

843
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,650
up with this thing

844
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,540
while the computer does not because if there is a

845
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,460
variation of a 1 and you make me moon and or

846
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,640
by 4 points and not  it is difficult to understand it

847
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,940
I finished two seconds so the

848
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,880
human ear has a lot to this decoding

849
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,100
that the conclusions to make and even at

850
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,230
low noise so you hear the beep beep

851
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,300
however it can decode even with

852
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,950
low powers thanks bye
