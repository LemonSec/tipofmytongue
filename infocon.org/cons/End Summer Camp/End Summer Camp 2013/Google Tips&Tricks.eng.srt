00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,810
will understand when I do the talk about what it will be

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,510
google from the desecration docs not  they are

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,740
nothing more than keywords that

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,350
can be used to filter and

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,620
improve searches there are lots of

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,440
torx furniture but I will use I will show I will explain

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,230
the most common ones the most useful ones

14
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,499


15
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:48,050
let's start with title thanks google if we filter with the title and

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,539
words admin and login there  then will come

17
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:54,050

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,059

19
00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:03,519
admin and login are well 100 and 9000

20
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:07,040
results with the pro am login

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,939
see how to have fun the keyword

22
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:13,479
in a filter in hulk and strict to

23
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,700
specify or allure that word there

24
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,049
in this  case

25
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:23,210
admin and php told you what to do there

26
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,490
are eight and a half million words of

27
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:31,039
url with roll admin allorch  é php we can

28
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,909
also use words like ascom like

29
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:38,649
robots.txt a robot whatever you want

of the page

34
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,119

35
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,329
deserve fortunately 18  results but then they

36
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,390

copyright act of 2001 if I am not mistaken

139
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,449
that it is practically a set of

140
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:01,690
US laws for the management

141
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,820
of copyrighted content for

142
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,350
example it tells us that we can not

143
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,270
disassemble a device to see how it

144
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,210
works it was used to prevent it

145
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,680
from being  see the dvds

146
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,710
with the css library for precisely the

147
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,630
dvd criteria remove the zone blocks

148
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,220
etc. and among other things it also serves

149
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,020
to remove copyrighted content from the

150
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,830


151
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,060
google results in this case

152
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,500
the funny thing that after the mess

153
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,330
that  there has been with scientology

154
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,610
by google it was founded by some

155
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,880
american lawyers in collaboration with

156
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,470
the electronic mantia fondation in the

157
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,410
chilling effect site that

158
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,930
worried that there was an

159
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,759
excessively high number of these requests

160
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,979
for removal of contents and they decided

161
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:58,370
to collect them publish them

162
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,229
after the scientology scandal

163
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,310
google began to send a  this

164
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,710
group chilling effect all

165
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,090
requests for removal of link files

166
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,490
etc. that were sent by the various

167
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,220
copyright holders

168
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,639
in this case for example we can

169
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,240
see that the well name has been

170
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,099
deleted but the request was

171
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:27,710
made by this anti piracy markmonitor

172
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,570
because usually  companies do not do it

173
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,880
themselves they give

174
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,950
the right to other third party companies that do

175
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,039
only this to send

176
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,820
requests for removal of content

177
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,919

178
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,100
in what area united states the link that I know

179
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,750

180
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,280
remove these are the

181
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,220

182
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,610

216
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,470

guys there is our friend who was

257
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,050
then my friend in my opinion it was just an

258
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,860
excuse to build you in reality and croatian after

259
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,180
the war in  yugoslavia was adopted

260
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,950
by a family of vezia would be fine

261
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,270
therefore in the face of a Slav

262
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,880
vestments a nissim and I do not think it was

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,459
to excuse the christie rega inside the

264
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:26,130
