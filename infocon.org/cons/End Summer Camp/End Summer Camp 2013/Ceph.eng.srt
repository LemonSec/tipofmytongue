1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,219
hello 6 ready is recording well

2
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:10,560
then

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,420
what we see today is the shepp filesystem

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,880


5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,970
for those who prefer this file system it

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,640
was born with the need so much a free

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,180
software so it is open source it was born with

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,500
the current need which is that

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,540
of disk management therefore

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,329
storage management that

11
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,340
nowadays is growing more and more

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,989
storage problem is that a certain size has arrived

13
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,899
even on systems of a certain

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,040
level it becomes difficult to expand them

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,649
the idea is to create a system for

16
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,270
which we are able to  add and

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,920
remove nodes without going online

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,450
so without having to stop the whole

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,620
system and above all without having therefore

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,260
without having problems turning off nodes

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,650
and giving problems to customers and

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,540
above all having the replica so it

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,640
guarantees let's say bricole replication

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,400
concerns data redundancy  and it

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,890
guarantees that even if one of the nodes or

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,110
the monitoring stops nothing happens

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,770
to the system

28
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:25,079
we are able to manage gestio  ne

29
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,049
block 15 opens able to show you a

30
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,960
block system then a physical

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,569
disk you create a 10 giga lilo disk

32
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:36,840
mounted on a machine on a

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,929
client machine and you see it as a bar must

34
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:43,399
cross b to cheat bd 0 format

35
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,299
partition the do that  that you want

36
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,729
you see it as a disk so you have a

37
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,530
disk mounted that actually happened

38
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,600
inside the center within the

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,520
cluster

40
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,380
the other possibility is to see a

41
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,829
non-block object system type s3 is

42
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,330
compatible

43
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,670
with amazon s3 a for which any

44
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,450
interface that works with restful

45
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,460
protocol s3 works perfectly and

46
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,660
therefore you are able to work

47
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,730
the other and file system that we say its

48
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,170
milan fs because a fascist indeed

49
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,210
arranges 2 manage directory files

50
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,890
what and what else and exposes itself

51
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,220
let's say type nfs in  this case

52
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,959
is not yet considered stable so

53
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,170
they advise against use in the company

54
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,010
then he was born natively as an

55
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,110
outlook object storage all the others

56
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,430
are nothing but  and interface that

57
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,890
they learn type s3 and transform it into

58
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,010
objects he of his work on objects does not

59
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,690
work blocks also the blocks

60
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,940
are actually then translated into objects so

61
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,480
there is an interface in the case of

62
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,160
blocks it is a kernel level interface

63
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,190
here on  client linux you have a system

64
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,920
mount your own mount rb of idate

65
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,930
command of what are the monitors and

66
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,310
he passes the disks in the case of rados there is

67
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,100
the sparse daemon that practically does

68
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,140
the interface or blocks s3 as

69
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:36,510
regards the block storage  it is possible to

70
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,370
make the site of the image for which you give

71
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,020
a disc from 10 then it becomes from a small

72
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,070
and enlarged to 20 30 etc.

73
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,810
you can export and import the images

74
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,290
you can copy or rename

75
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,930
a disc this very useful for making

76
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,860
the  cloning of virtual machines

77
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,540
you can make a snap shot read only for

78
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,660
which they are now the

79
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,880
standard features for which you can also go

80
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,490
back between with snapshots etc.

81
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,850
let's say that it was born with the requirement

82
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,250
initially of kvm then it is expanded in

83
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,170
reality now the use is

84
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,810
also becoming for other uses because as they

85
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,620
say

86
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,930
in the display a disk for which it is possible to

87
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,780
use it in any field in the sense

88
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,550
that you can also actually have a

89
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,160
virtual machine that has a disk  that

90
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,720
inside chip for which

91
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,610
operating system or maybe the data the website

92
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,979
inside chet s3 for example can

93
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:36,199
be used that we have seen before

94
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,050
inside have a website I don't know from

95
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,840
any supplier and have the image

96
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,860
of the internal ds3 because the ds3 case the

97
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,430
images are the access to the blog to the files

98
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,229
can also be seen as an

99
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,930
http path for which you can have the storage

100
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,699
of the images and within them

101
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,190
there is certainly the link and the

102
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,199
links that  point those files and the website

103
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,770
somewhere else

104
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,840
you can take an image export it from

105
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,470
another part exact there is for file

106
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,590
system

107
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:22,490
in essence it is a posix compatible system it

108
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,000
is infinite in the sense that they do not have

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,030
a u  n sorry it is infinite in the sense that it

110
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,080
is infinite in the sense that you can

111
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,910
add as many nodes as you want and it

112
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,210
expands so they have no finite space

113
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,560
as you add no he

114
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,630
expands automatically you don't have

115
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,789
to climb anything so you have a

116
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:42,919
space it's like having  a space nor fs that

117
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:44,210
increases every time you add a

118
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:50,090
next node and is suitable from this

119
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,840
point of view when it will remain stable

120
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,419
because not at a critical point so that

121
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,160
then in the ju these nodes there will be

122
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,870
latency I would have made that it notices that 9

123
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,560
jun

124
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,220
but  the file I don't know one was writing it

125
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,840
was reading the from the finish

126
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,460
somewhere else and it will resume

127
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,580
no customizations or

128
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,770
special additions are required just having only the

129
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,750
ceps clients is able to work with

130
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,580
all three interfaces we had seen

131
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,849
before

132
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,330
another interesting thing is  that there is the

133
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,460
automatic balancing after we see

134
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,650
it so when we add a node

135
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,819
he calmly balances everything the

136
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,009
same when a node wants  we remove

137
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:38,080
a node he tends to rebalance everything

138
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,560
so it is logical that it depends on the level

139
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,750
of redundancy we see afterwards we want to

140
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,409
give him able to

141
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:49,419
automatically maximize

142
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,699
performance by balancing the load between the

143
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:52,210
various nodes

144
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,189
and it is logical that this manages to keep it

145
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:55,569
when you have more than three nodes

146
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,879
if you have three nodes you have a pair

147
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,009
of 3 then each time a fine pair

148
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:02,740
on the three nodes can do little in this case

149
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,129
because it cannot very still can

150
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:08,199
optimize a lot if you have ten

151
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,439
nodes is able to put  with files on

152
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,000
blocks and three machines with the other

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,340
three and with the other three of which you have the

154
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,979
machine that goes to work especially

155
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,659
the network because we are working on the network

156
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:22,779
without putting 10gb cards you can

157
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:27,159
work in a more optimized way

158
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:31,719
this is  the architecture therefore he is

159
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:34,060
able to give you the server file system

160
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,169
I saw again that in blocks the radon sgherri

161
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:40,029
is actually an interface in the

162
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,589
classic library that they all have for  so if

163
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,870
you are good at cc plus and you can

164
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,879
work directly on the

165
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,560
library and work with the

166
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,509
cluster file system level which is actually called

167
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,900
rados rados the real system it

168
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,589
works with so there is any of these

169
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,569
interfaces in the fact that translating into a

170
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,229
block system  suitable close there are

171
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:02,650
questions

172
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,698
I go ahead

173
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,660
then let's say that the minimum you need

174
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,180
at least to have redundancy and two nodes

175
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,590
and a server monitor in reality this is

176
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,680
what so not only 45 server nodes

177
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,750
and three monitors if you need to use the

178
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,970
filesystem you also need  an MDS

179
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,710
also in this case you can put it

180
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,720
as usual the daemon you run it on

181
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,349
one of the three nodes or on all three nodes

182
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:35,520
let's say that this is the one that manages

183
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,429
the logging and the

184
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:42,020
fascist's metadata

185
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,980
then on the nodes there are basically

186
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,120
two  demons that run actually three sorry

187
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,980
to make work what is needed the s of

188
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,350
usd to a demon that runs on every disk

189
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,209
that we want to have so if on a

190
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:59,490
machine there are  four disks and we

191
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,440
have no laughs but we want to show

192
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,839
these four disks I accept they need 4

193
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,209
usd that are working

194
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:08,339
each for each disk the disk must

195
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,160
be formatted formatting

196
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,600
we usually say that they are

197
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,149
optimizing it for br tfs but not yet

198
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:17,520
stable at this moment they recommend

199
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,980
xfs for  the production therefore essentially

200
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,880
you must have an xfs disk to be entirely

201
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
dedicated usd

202
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,990
then be to the fascist sorry to the

203
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,370
demon usd

204
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,200
he takes the disk and expose it

205
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,170
to the monitor

206
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,200
the monitor knows that that is a node in

207
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,870
essence the three monitors in reality there is n  'he is

208
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,040
one that is working in a given

209
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,350
instant the others are on standby the

210
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,830
monitor is the one who knows physically

211
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,930
what the structure is like and where the blocks are

212
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,940
the files and the blocks etcetera etcetera

213
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,220
he is the one who knows everything that the

214
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,120
node map  the nodes know nothing

215
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,220
about file commissions is what commands

216
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,560
on the monitor and that there are three

217
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,170
and all three must work sorry

218
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,750
at least one d  and the three if one of these does

219
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,580
not work the file system is not visible

220
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,120
because the client does not go directly to the

221
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,490
nodes but asks you when you go

222
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,529
configure do not put the nodes then

223
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:22,950
put the monitors as sent the

224
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,050
monitor 1 monitor 2 lines of the monitor one

225
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,930
coin 2 warning  3 he connects one of the

226
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,089
three warning there he says give me the map he

227
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:31,890
marks the map at that moment the map

228
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,329
is inside the clients if there are

229
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:34,740
variations they talk to each other between the monitors

230
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,420
when the deal is writing

231
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,350
he is the map and he goes to write though

232
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,300
what is fundamental is that they

233
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,470
monitor stand up

234
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,829
if there are no monitors the cluster

235
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,170
falls completely attention that it is enough

236
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,760
to return us to the monitor and the clusters

237
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,600
usually

238
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,410
but if you can go and play with

239
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,860
the map database and dirty the map

240
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,930
you do not go out  more recover the files that

241
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,410
are around so the map is

242
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,250
essential that it is not ruined on the

243
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,399
monitors he is an internal map of how they

244
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,589
are distributed this is a way

245
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,420
to r  I build it but up to part

246
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,829
I have never tried it I do not intend to try it

247
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:20,130
so the facts are there and in some cases

248
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,199
when you do the update it must be

249
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:24,420
stable that they tell you look that

250
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,550
the monitor mode has changed you have to

251
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,870
update all three as fast as

252
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,269
possible  of all 3 or I say

253
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:31,620
there are no problems update as

254
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,009
you want

255
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:34,170
that case is because

256
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,819
the database management mode changes and then they make it

257
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:38,370
change as soon as possible because it

258
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,589
could happen that it is ruined

259
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:44,100
so the security makes you do it as

260
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,540
quickly as possible

261
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,250
in reality they know the versions and

262
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,550
do not overwrite the other one year ago

263
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,410
but for safety they tell you to do it

264
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,149
as quickly as possible so everyone and

265
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:56,160
at the same version and

266
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,839
you have no chance because if that

267
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,040
moment freezes

268
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,139
there is only one  reasoning only of

269
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,759
one at that moment it is he who is

270
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,110
managing the map because the others

271
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,490
having the old version no

272
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,500
longer manage the  map otherwise he

273
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,339
would order it then die sorry the

274
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,560
disc can be a physical disc or

275
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,839
given a sedated raid he laughs and you have

276
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,579
ten discs under it for him a disc

277
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,560
does not change anything it's a decision your

278
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,209
performance

279
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:22,589
how do you have what you have at home

280
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:24,329
you want to use  what you have in the house and

281
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:28,998
cr7 there are no problems and you said sorry

282
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,519
one of his things

283
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,699
if it is his thing is a map he

284
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:40,248
created by him is a file basically

285
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,330
I have to do it I have to agree I have not

286
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,250
checked if it increases commenting in

287
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,880
hate no but not  it is big actually the

288
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,830
blocks are grouped in what

289
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,160
he calls pg sorry but in the chord the name

290
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,130
however they are called pg1 pg2 pgi 3 pc 4

291
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:03,060
that the actual map where they are

292
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,440
saved inside the nodes he is

293
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,180
the map does nothing but  pass these

294
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,090
data to the clients then the client

295
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,920
asks the monitor for the map and from the

296
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,970
map including the ip of the nodes

297
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,040
therefore able to manage to do the

298
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,550
writing

299
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,740
every time you write  on one node it is the

300
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,660
node that arranges to map

301
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,400
on the other side for him too to the

302
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,220
map having all the map let's say that it

303
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,410
is a distributed peer to peer system it

304
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,820
looks a lot like peer to peer because

305
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,220
everyone has the map every time

306
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,930
that the modification is made a map

307
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,360
is passed to all the map to a

308
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,130
sequential thing a sequential 1 that

309
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,050
increases with timestamp in fact one thing

310
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,170
that must be done that the internal clock

311
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,550
of the machine must be

312
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,800
very precise so you have to use in the

313
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,110
types better if  1 came in the house and

314
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,440
everyone goes to that one so at least if he is

315
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,060
wrong by a few cents, however, they

316
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,830
are all wrong by a few cents because

317
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,010
if it varies by a few thousandths it begins

318
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,160
to give horror it tells you war niguarda that

319
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,740
this is out of a few milliseconds if

320
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,290
then it is out of the whole  it kicks it so

321
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,440
you have to the only thing to keep in mind

322
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,970
the monitor is what I said before it

323
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,649
manages the whole part

324
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:24,129
of the map manages the possibility of

325
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,540
saving  I therefore how the files are to be

326
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,029
distributed and as I said before

327
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:30,879
if 3 are considered co in theory they

328
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,920
say three suicides verses 3 different power supplies

329
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,069
3 or different ps so the maximum

330
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:40,529
you can have in order not to block the

331
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:47,230
MDS monitor what I said before manages the

332
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,220
whole part  posix requests are not

333
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,319
needed in case you are not interested in using

334
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:56,309
certain file system

335
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,579
let's see them all then I was saying before

336
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:06,819
rados is the real file system cep works

337
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,160
collados bados is the

338
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,129
block saving system rbd is the one that

339
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:13,629
simulates the disk for which one of the

340
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:16,119
interfaces this we have  seen it is certain

341
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:19,179
file system so it looks a bit sly

342
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:21,759
that here is a bit nfs seen that via

343
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,579
radio network sweat vie looks like s3 indeed

344
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:28,660
sorry it is an s3 compatible interface and

345
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,600
freeing up the interface instead of

346
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,529
free excuse interfaces and

347
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,740
interfacing for the cc  plus plus

348
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,410
questions up one thing to take into account is

349
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,360
possible because many will never ask me

350
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,370
possible admit so far you have

351
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,230
never asked but I know that  he asks for

352
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,850
network is it possible goal also good he has already

353
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,410
asked he pretends nothing but in

354
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,779
reality he asked me first I take

355
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,069
a node and put it on another data

356
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:57,069
center it works

357
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:58,179
in reality you could also put

358
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:00,100
another monitor played data center you have

359
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,259
the  advantage that if the data center goes down and

360
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:03,759
you have the same data on the other hand as

361
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,889
soon as it comes back up it sends the data everything

362
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:09,249
I say works there is only one thing that

363
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:10,600
should be careful that you must have

364
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,230
an excellent line 32 data center  because

365
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,209
more than anything else for performance he

366
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:20,230
when we say two on when you write

367
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,660
a disk he does it writes starts the

368
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,249
first block he goes to write it on one of the

369
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,889
three nodes that moment is

370
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:29,790
considered primary for that group

371
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,319
when he writes data to you if we have the

372
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:33,430
he replies at 3

373
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,980
then on two other machines until

374
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,339
he has had the ck from both of them he does not go

375
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:39,790
on

376
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,880
ok in fact the final okay is there for the sixth

377
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,740
time when he has had the ok and from the first

378
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,240
and ok also from the second

379
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,560
if they have  got the ok e  and two other nodes

380
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,440
he does not give ok to the client so for him he

381
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,670
remains waiting

382
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,290
if you have a linux machine with rb of

383
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,160
you you see the weight that goes up waiting

384
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,050
for this writing if this is on

385
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,940
another data center because maybe at 300

386
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,250
milliseconds  waiting 300,000 second

387
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,130
extended on disk painting is a lot

388
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,780
so you have to be careful to have

389
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,839
no lat in fiber and 67 milliseconds is a

390
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,959
single gigabit of 100 megabits

391
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,599
otherwise if you have to wait for the third

392
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,349
ck you have if it is to make a backup in the evening

393
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,790
for  having a copy even I'm found

394
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,349
center is fine because even if it

395
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,349
waits slows down I don't care if you

396
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,939
give a mail system in real

397
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:31,240
time and you know that you have

398
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,640
very low latency vein because otherwise you don't have

399
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,700
it becomes very slow the

400
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:46,059
system throws it out at that  point

401
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:49,249
well 300 milliseconds does not throw it out

402
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:51,740
must pass a few seconds after a

403
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,389
few seconds if you cut the line it is

404
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:54,529
thrown out

405
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:55,279
ouch he starts working

406
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,169
correctly why not  n he goes no longer

407
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:00,110
write on the map 3 is no longer there as

408
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,350
soon as 3 returns he continues to

409
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,970
work 1 and 2

410
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,710
begins to synchronize 3 when

411
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,600
three synchronized everything is all

412
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,320
right then he inserts it in it

413
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:21,769
takes a while and it is not 19  immediate no the

414
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,269
node you destroy it sky sorry it

415
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,879
destroys you remove it from the list there is him

416
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:28,309
not if instead it responds to 3 400

417
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,139
milliseconds it is only a slowdown of the

418
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:31,990
whole system of 3 400

419
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:46,100
milliseconds you see it from the waitt of the there more then

420
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,659
use it  even as a backup system the

421
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,700
night shots are depends on how many giga

422
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,259
because in one night it can't make it if to

423
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:53,169
many gb because there from low priority

424
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:55,610
also because every now and then it scrubs the

425
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,769
whole system without checking that

426
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,179
all the blocks are correct by all

427
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,220
the parts then go to make different

428
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,740
systems see in fact scrub ok every now and then

429
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,019
because he goes to check that some in

430
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,519
blocks goes to check that everything is

431
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,470
ok so he always works a little

432
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,269
at a time, especially less load to more

433
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:14,110
jobs  it's his business

434
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,020
to get out yes

435
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,040
to 10 from

436
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,460
you are wanting himself

437
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,090
no is that in if you use the disc if you

438
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,700
put two three data centers a monitor

439
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,320
tracks data center is a node for each

440
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,370
data center from a technical point of view

441
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,779
you  you could have that go down to

442
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:44,899
two data centers and still have the data

443
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:47,700
I would have to switch the p depends on the

444
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,409
system but from a purely technical point of view they

445
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:51,960
must from down two three

446
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,120
data centers because actually you

447
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,320
have not given

448
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,149
the only disadvantage it has and  that if where to

449
00:19:57,149 --> 00:19:59,279
write a file until he has

450
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:00,899
written on both sides the date feels he

451
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,539
does not give you the okay for which

452
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,240
there could be a latency problem there is only the

453
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,220
one from so if you do it it is

454
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,409
feasible but you have to do a  something for

455
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,890
which the latency was within something

456
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,750
acceptable i

457
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,100
said before the

458
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,399
automatic relaunch here are two lsd i said

459
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:21,929
before that with the blocks they come indeed the

460
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,760
blocks are grouped in pg when you

461
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,100
add the node he vari balance

462
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,179
a bit to the  time it is not an

463
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:31,860
immediate thing or to rebalance so it goes to

464
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,850
distribute all the blocks in the various of the

465
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,159
node the more you add no more from the

466
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,470
technical point of view it becomes with less

467
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:51,270
latency certain to go wrong but look

468
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,360
up

469
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,220
then we start first does the scrub

470
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,470
so  there is the consistency of the data of the data

471
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,400
announces xoom in the

472
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,200
meantime the check is made

473
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,059
so that even if one of the

474
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,490
blocks in which the disk is damaged there

475
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,150
are problems alive it goes to report it

476
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:18,340
then and goes to move the block this

477
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,929
here is  an example this here is an example

478
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:26,230
of a command on a real node

479
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,460
essentially shows the tree of the

480
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,530
sdi in this case they are my three nodes

481
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,290
which are all three apps

482
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,030
unfortunately there is no internet are my

483
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,559
idea to show that there  we have a

484
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,500
car and you saw that a node went down

485
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,800
then resumed did a bit of

486
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,710
checks it gave it a warning then you

487
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,080
saw that it went back up that it was

488
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,520
all right then did some

489
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,870
checks it went for seconds tsar and

490
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,270
since it is not in use at the moment

491
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,470
because surely they will not backup

492
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,530
now anyway if they were backing up a

493
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,059
reboot there is not so much data

494
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,610
exchange the data you saw ok but there

495
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,590
is not so here instead lsd dump in

496
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,990
this case are all the volumes that

497
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,600
I created some are created

498
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,770
automatically

499
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,530
by those that then the one for s3 that

500
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,940
had to save the logs the users booked

501
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,010
ds3 this here is a thing a

502
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,820


503
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,530
test disk I removed all the part of the size 3

504
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:38,690
identifies the degree of redundancy so they

505
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,520
are all  in this case three so

506
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,320
the distances 3 I write on a disk it

507
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:42,620
ends up

508
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,600
sorry sorry I write about the way to

509
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,469
end up on two other nodes

510
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:08,970


511
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,750
you know I can't tell you

512
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,670
because this deposit site insight 1

513
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,560
I don't think that identifying

514
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,850
the maximum number of  however

515
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,030
social cover in reality this line here is

516
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:29,920
long there are also things I

517
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,110
can't tell you about because not everything is

518
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,680
documented yet on the let's say

519
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,170
configuration part of the rest  or yes part ii

520
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,600
still on the manual there is not everything yet

521
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,580
however as it comes out and they are

522
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,110
actually updating it who other

523
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,350
questions

524
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,760
are questions are a bit quick but I have

525
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,020
to do two in an hour

526
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,400
the only advantage of this that offers the

527
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,310
interfaces already available immediately the

528
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,020
others you have to adapt because one does

529
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,700
only one thing another does only the other

530
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,090
this has all already done and not to a

531
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,130
single then in file luca some instead

532
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,770
there is the latency due to the fact

533
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,830
that one  of the monitors sorry one thing goes down

534
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,640
the other restarts instead this case

535
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,260
in reality one node goes down the other

536
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,590
already responds for a few seconds but

537
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,080
admirer responds much more responsive instead

538
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,430
the other cases quite something of

539
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:43,280
this is much more distributed some

540
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,840
tasks are followed between  the nodes

541
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,940
then move information then the

542
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,950
node the map and the client already knows the

543
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,980
map and wise it arranges a bit there is an

544
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,130
algorithm that is common for which it is not good to

545
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,760
mount other functions but

546
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,140
much more routine  quillo in the sense that if

547
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,790
I want a 10gb disk shown to

548
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,630
the linux machine

549
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,210
I use it here I want to throw in

550
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,820
files like s3 I throw them

551
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,810
in actually inside of course the files the blocks

552
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:18,740
are who knows where then in reality you can

553
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,600
say I want to know where I am  block and it

554
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,340
tells you on what nodes there are and it is not that you do

555
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,810
not know it but in that instant you do not know

556
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,840
where it is writing for each machine a

557
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,700
map are synchronized I must admit

558
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,650
that it works when it is used by

559
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:34,940
me 200 gb are saved  so far

560
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,700


561
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,580
no problems whatsoever and I have made

562
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,960
updates several times then updated

563
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,279
one car at a time angry one

564
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,639
car at a time while on one I was

565
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:46,620
doing the couple in racing just to let

566
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,149
him do to see how it was going

567
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:50,789
and I had no problems his type if I

568
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:52,320
need a  other type of sky interface

569
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,029
that is therefore to everything already integrated without

570
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:57,389
even for the boxes and it is the

571
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,490
configuration file is none other than lilo

572
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,700
sd1 these pvs of two these psd  3

573
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,220
questp a common key to all for the

574
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,500
exchange of information that must be done

575
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:13,529
here does not go yes invoice so

576
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:15,929
in s3 you have all the axis including the

577
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:18,149
encryption through s3 it does it to you

578
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:21,059
even if three words information

579
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,830
no no no I'm  paying the encryption for

580
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,659
the commands when he sends you the map

581
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:29,100
because you as the machine you

582
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,240
can configure the machine with

583
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,889
only one direct card and if you want the

584
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:35,429
replica is the file that gives you that you

585
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,019
ask that it gives you it does it on the same

586
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:39,299
interface  in my case instead on

587
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,919
separate it has an interface where it does the

588
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,350
replicas and an interface due to the

589
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,500
data but if you are the common interface

590
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,389
one could send a packet of a

591
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:50,340
fake map or even and did not

592
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,990
match a key to encode

593
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,049
at least the map that  one cannot

594
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:56,700
pacify the map you can take it off

595
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,480
wanting to make your senses ankara to

596
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,820
share substances learn

597
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,309
electrical cep copies in packages on all

598
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:08,039
nodes is the common key in ssh moans

599
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,080
on all  the nodes and to the one command on

600
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,399
one and it configures you all the

601
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:13,139
automatic machines to a script that makes you all

602
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:14,880
the machines that deplore the machine in

603
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,950
you you just have to make the first

604
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,830
configuration file then it said sd1 ip1 if

605
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,700
two p2

606
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,309
put 10 all the  machines is not the

607
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,159
ssh key from the command and tele configures

608
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,549
all so even bother and

609
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:32,610
at an abnormal speed we see ourselves more to

610
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,500
mount the machines this is one of the

611
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,269
few cases in which you do more to amount

612
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:37,600
the machine than

613
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:46,090
to mount on the clusters  moon the only

614
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:49,120
tuning you can do at the moment

615
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,840
you do it from the hardware point of view then

616
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,210
pass raid 5 then dodge it from

617
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,910
discs the only thing you can do

618
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,169
but in reality it is not done to make

619
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:03,460
tuning never done to optimize that I know

620
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,530
if you have  seen before in the image

621
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:09,400
this he divides this is a map for

622
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,890
which it is a pool a rack

623
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,740
in reality there is also data center as an

624
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,870
entry so you have the pool that is inside

625
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,539
a data center hicks data center y data

626
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:23,740
center recker fi  the 2 and you can map and

627
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,140
decide how to map because he maps

628
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,500
but if you have a need to have

629
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,090
as I said before for example put

630
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,250
four disks then 4s of for each

631
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,049
server to be careful that he is not going

632
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:37,270
to save everything on the same machine and

633
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,340
dvd leo through an element map

634
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,070
for him he does not know that the map and the disk

635
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:49,870
are different no it is different

636
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,549
put what you want node is what I

637
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:54,220
want the moment to space it is logical

638
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,260
that you have a map in which he tells you

639
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,960
the percentage for each disk  when

640
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,429
a certain percentage arrives I do not use it

641
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:08,340
more attention than with the same

642
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,780
type of mapping in this case this

643
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,490
yes in reality then no then he must also have

644
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,289
different disks but he recommended the

645
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:16,880
same disk so you add another 3

646
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,669
nodes instead for the same

647
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:24,650
fees  equality but reality if you then add

648
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,480
what they consider many nodes

649
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,940
because if this is a land this and a

650
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,840
half to this and a half and do the replication

651
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,419
of three in reality it will not help and 500gb

652
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:37,940
because it  when arrived 499 who says

653
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,789
99 percent busy that knows that the other

654
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:43,460
vehicle cannot use it you lose it is like

655
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,100
su ride if you have a raid 5 with

656
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,970
60 gb disks

657
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,220
put one to a hundred you know he uses 60

658
00:29:49,220 --> 00:30:00,770
the others from lost to  known I have turned off

659
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,780
all up to 1 until a warning and a

660
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,990
node precisely from everything you do not notice

661
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:11,120
after which it turns on you know that yes yes yes yes

662
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,539
you see everything a little make a say see the

663
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:16,549
speech also because it was on a

664
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:17,840
virtual machine  the machine is useful it

665
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,649
continues to work

666
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,500
the only thing that has to be careful in

667
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,780
quotes that he is not so fast

668
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,720
resynchronize and therefore it is not a raid

669
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,880
that in 2 seconds it takes I have seen

670
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,550
that

671
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,780
for a 100 giga it was more than one night

672
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,750
between 24 and 48 hours there are a

673
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,530
hundred gigs it was between 24 and 48 hours

674
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,690
to synchronize and try to make sure

675
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,700
everything is in order

676
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,370
and logical that if the 100 nodes replicate

677
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,290
three in short, that two other machines are turned off

678
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,930
then it was also  in

679
00:30:54,930 --> 00:31:00,680
short, to wait for a problem for other questions

680
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,490
he knows

681
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:05,760
good does not require to look for apt get

682
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,730
install advice point 12 will also

683
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,560
advise them indeed I do not recommend will

684
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,200
recommend them stable ubuntu the latest

685
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,900
lts 12 04

686
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,990
no no el arabs of use a

687
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,460
cannes system there is perfect and I don't know  say

688
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,680
to take care that he uses fuse for now but

689
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,440
I can't tell you why I don't follow him

690
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,080
you have a kernel mode module problems

691
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,300
of work with the risks of just telling him

692
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,900
look that the disk is the one for which he does

693
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,150
not ask me other type of I must admit

694
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,400
that  it's one of the easiest I've ever

695
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,370
done as perhaps easier this

696
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:53,600
than doing an ext3 filesystem

697
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:04,570
sorry for the speed but other

698
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,740
questions recommend it can be done with extra 4

699
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,590
has no problems others advise against

700
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,740
because they use functions that are not

701
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,810
implemented  because they vain to use

702
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,400
specific functions for those file

703
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,850
systems

704
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:32,480
let's say that they recommend xfs in

705
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,490
production and in a few years they will

706
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,220
consider br tfs because it allows you to

707
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,870
do more functions than  it is

708
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,600
not that it does them but on the cydia in

709
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,910
production because not so much it is not

710
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:48,200
stable but it is not stable bltf even

711
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,070
if some do
