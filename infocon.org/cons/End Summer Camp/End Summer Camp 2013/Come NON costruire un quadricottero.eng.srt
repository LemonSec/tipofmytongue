1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:10,380
I am master gp he and big shot we are

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,170
that the procedural costs

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:23,100
here in san donà via san citro we go on

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,779
wednesday for now only me big shot the

5
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:37,030
sebum and we begin to think about how to

6
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,520
build our hacker space one of the

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,809
projects that we were interested in was to

8
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:44,290
create  a quadcopter, however, not

9
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,719
having a very large budget

10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,180
we thought of making a quadcopter

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,899
with a very low budget

12
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,879
then what happened the idea came

13
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,430
about a year ago no

14
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,700
in the meantime you want to start right from the

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,160
origin of the origins of the origins and we

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,830
disgrace ourselves because we are here for this

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,270
learn from my face is practically

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,880
at the beginning there was this idea big shot

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,300
instead he had the idea of the airship

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,280
obviously because the

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,690
quadcopter had already done it a lot of people

22
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,420
around the world airship meters no

23
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,090
but we were the first to  fail the

24
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,740
brake an airship in fact we

25
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,270
made it among other things we managed to get

26
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,590
you to say in the airship construction in

27
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,150
fact

28
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,170
the project is at a standstill ment  re for the

29
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,940
quadcopter we started by

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,420
step

31
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,080
I personally

32
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,510
bought a small

33
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,460
remote controlled plane big before

34
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,950
polystyrene because so there was also the

35
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,479
remote control and a receiver and a

36
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,510
receiver included and so I said

37
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,840
I take this I train a little to fly

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,259
to play a  po so there

39
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,240
are already prices for my

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,699
quadcopter I take this

41
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,390
beautiful plane for 80 euros it

42
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,550
was a bit badly taken I carry it back to fix

43
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,459
everything I do not have here the video but if you

44
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,420
notice see on the youtube channel of the esc

45
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,280
there is the video of the  first flight of my

46
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,910
plane that practically got up install

47
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:32,690
the and breaks completely and this is

48
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,170


49
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,150
the beauty is that this remote control despite

50
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,180
being in the Chinese garbage to a

51
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,550
socket for the simulator so with

52
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,110
this fantastic socket I can

53
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,110
connect my remote control to the computer

54
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,599
and  using a simulation program that

55
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,000
allows me to train myself to drive

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,860
my model, however, it did

57
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,840
not help

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,640
so invest first error  and investing

59
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,819
in a model that is already difficult to drive

60
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,530
if you want to start making

61
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,209
remote-controlled models you have to start with a

62
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,310
very small model, very cheap

63
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,760
and very repairable, make it land on the

64
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,020
nerve maybe instead of doing it

65
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,900
especially exact instead on the asphalt

66
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,540
well spend some time in the  in the meantime

67
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,420
we go on with other projects

68
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,010
other works and in the end the idea

69
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,310
of working on the quadcopter returns the idea

70
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,100
was to prepare it and have it ready for the

71
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,209
ski so as to make beautiful

72
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,700
aerial shots as you see in fact it is

73
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,160
as well as making you participate in a

74
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,860
fantastic workshop a fantastic

75
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,300
workshop on how to build a

76
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,310
quadcopter that will be there tomorrow

77
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:02,989
but we ran into some

78
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:08,680
problems the number one speech then

79
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,599
if you want to make a quadcopter then

80
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:31,600
with the idea that following the idea is a

81
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,990
test

82
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,090
the idea is that  to build the

83
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,870
cheapest quadcopter possible

84
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,790
and so that even if it breaks at least we

85
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,490
haven't lost too many know

86
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,350
ldi is actually a wrong idea in the sense

87
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,750
that if you spend a little money and then it

88
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,340
breaks you are money that you have thrown away you

89
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,070
spend a lot of money it is more difficult for

90
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:57,290
it to break or at least there is more room

91
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:02,030
for errors in the pilot and therefore  also here

92
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,110
we have toppato great in

93
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,970
particular here we see the screen on

94
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:11,210
ebay of 20 for 6 2013

95
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,889
then we bought iphone 4 sani

96
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:19,330
sky brushless motorway adapter which are

97
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,810
the mopeds

98
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,320
here it is this fantastic

99
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,030
moped with the adapter that this

100
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,000
here cross and the  'adapter to mount it on the

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,470
frame then four for 30 brushless pid

102
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,380
controller and multi cocktail kk multi

103
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,150
coop why are these circuits of those

104
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,500
dreams circuits to control the motors

105
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,890
then we bought a usb loader plus

106
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,250
usb asp program more kk multi copter

107
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,730
board that is this this  here is a

108
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,350
know circuit that contains quite a

109
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,770
microcontroller that controls all

110
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,040
motors and contains 303

111
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,110
gyroscope accelerometers this is definitely

112
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,490
the best buy  re that we did

113
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,520
by the way at the price of only 13 dollars

114
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,030
we got this fantastic

115
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,580
controller plus a programmer to

116
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,120
enroll the firmware that I don't have here

117
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,490
anyway this is another purchase

118
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,540
finally we bought two 2x2 then

119
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,610
four propellers four propellers on a

120
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,140
quadcopter in the  case you don't know

121
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,720
there are two propellers that turn

122
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,160
clockwise two propellers that rotate counterclockwise

123
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,780


124
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,800
as a quadcopter works briefly

125
00:06:46,800 --> 00:07:02,340
then there

126
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,230
are two propellers that are clockwise

127
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,250


128
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,380
on the two opposite sides and warlike that

129
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,300
rotate counterclockwise  in the other

130
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,900
two opposite sides, turning faster,

131
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,670
all of them turn the same speed and then the

132
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,670
helicopter and then by four it gets up

133
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:23,100
while if they turn faster, for example,

134
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,080
this quadcopter obviously

135
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,370
alters this way and will go on towards there and

136
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,440
vice versa, they make this faster

137
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,300
this is the quadcopter

138
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,509
on itself in this way there are

139
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:39,150
names like little leo but I don't have

140
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:46,500
still learned wellins of the fire

141
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,360
right for the front so

142
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,460
this group at ricotta is actually

143
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,440
called scott and we

144
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,909
marked visibly on top of the

145
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,699
front with this yellow purpose

146
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,340
so when it will be

147
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,039
about 20 30 meters high we  we will see very well

148
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,860
in which direction it is going

149
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,919
and then this is its

150
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,190
horizontal flight position

151
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,659
the movement forward or backward in

152
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:23,699
this way is called pitch in

153
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,590
Italian the lateral movement in this

154
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:34,469
way is called roll and then there is

155
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,620
the last movement  [ __ ] that is called

156
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,049
yaw I that this here so on

157
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,899
the horizontal plane

158
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,300
all here this allows you to go

159
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,760
forward back to the right left or

160
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,730
turn on the spot ok so we

161
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,910
saw moment that they are not cooked paintings

162
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,890
these are the components strictly

163
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,820
to do to have a  quadcopter

164
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:11,250
the last is therefore a structure on which to

165
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,709
mount all these components I had

166
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:15,329
this fantastic pr at home  ofylated

167
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:18,540
aluminum and in an evening

168
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,089
practically missing one thing we also bought

169
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:24,420
two batteries in one evening I said

170
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,510
we assembled practically

171
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,510
everything the structure and

172
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,040
the quadcopter and we turned

173
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,620
the propellers so mounting a

174
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,330
quadcopter is really simple

175
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,100
we took three fours  hours

176
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,300
ok well we did one of the homework

177
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,260


178
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,150
these here are the items we

179
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,610
bought the total was

180
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,450
around 120 euros which is not a big expense for

181
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,180
a quadcopter and what went wrong

182
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,220
what went wrong so where do we

183
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,430
start let's

184
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,800
start  see what

185
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,270
happened then this here that

186
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,000
the quadcopter controller was

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,920
practically mounted here and with its

188
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,630
accelerometers it keeps the

189
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,370
quadcopter stable by

190
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,860
continuously checking the speed of how many

191
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,770
motors this here with

192
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,570
very complex mathematical formulas to

193
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,420
calculate the stability for  find on

194
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,680
stability and this must be calibrated according to

195
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,650
of the frame of how the

196
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,440
four motors are mounted and of a series of

197
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,550
parameters first mistake buy a

198
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,800
cheap

199
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,540
controller this cheap controller has

200
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,990
no user interface it has only three

201
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,720
potentiometers to adjust the various

202
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,529
sensitivities

203
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,850
the integrated proportional of the pid cycle

204
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,560
if any of you mean  of

205
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,720
mathematics and then you go a little on your nose

206
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,680
a little with your eyes closed

207
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,209
what happened the first thing you do

208
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:23,220
when you mount a quadcopter and

209
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,819
test it without it is there that you then

210
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,370
check that all the motors turn in the

211
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,920
direction in which they should turn yes  makes a

212
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,639
calibration of the potential throw to

213
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,860
adjust the acceleration so that

214
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,019
all of these here who are the ex

215
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,879
who are among other things are called

216
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,850
esp electronic speed controller

217
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:48,779
each of these ex that must receive the

218
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,339
same signal from the accelerator and

219
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,889
therefore  therefore be

220
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:57,429
from the same number of revolutions and engines

221
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:01,329
at the same time and this procedure

222
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:04,149
is relatively simple once

223
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:04,779
the s  To do,

224
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:08,859
however, let's say that the quadcopter

225
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:11,109
flew quite recently the first time it

226
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:13,839
did not fly clearly

227
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,670
because

228
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,439
at the beginning it binds to a heavy object

229
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,029
so as not to fly it away and therefore

230
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:21,129
lose control

231
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:23,809
then it binds with four ropes a

232
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,670
heavy object he begins to

233
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,949
get up and you can see if it pulls more

234
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:31,189
motor if it turns on itself or

235
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:31,989
something like that

236
00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:35,119
well the quadcopter turned on

237
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:37,639
itself pushed to throw itself on

238
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,949
itself means that two motors were spinning

239
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:43,910
faster than the other two the

240
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,119
calibration did not work I don't know

241
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:49,369
how  never i could not calibrate it

242
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,949
potentials reading the documentation i

243
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:55,100
saw that there is a command to invert

244
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,699
gyros which means i said there will be

245
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:01,279
the gyroscope of the rotation which

246
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,129
will be inverted so i invert them and

247
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:06,529
make it run in the way and make it

248
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:08,689
star  straight in short then he did

249
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:10,669
this manual procedure I followed

250
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:16,059
everything then turned on the quadcopter

251
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:18,619
just given a bit of gas and qu

252
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:25,989
I took a copter at all so literally

253
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:29,119
what I discovered then I discovered

254
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:32,600
that inverting the gyroscopes was used to

255
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,249
reverse the position of this which

256
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:35,899
means that if I

257
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,049
only put the quadcopter like this and I put

258
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:41,239
it this way it goes one way yes this here I mount it below  the

259
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,970
quadcopter this goes like this so he

260
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,299
obviously tried to stay stable like this

261
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:50,179
and obviously he overturned by himself and

262
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:54,589
we broke two propellers we gave

263
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:56,299
two propellers what does this mean that

264
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:58,039
rightly we only bought

265
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,410
four propellers so we were still

266
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,620


267
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,040
until china sent us more  propellers

268
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,890
in fact if I do not know

269
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,810
and in fact we bought a lot of

270
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,470
propellers and the second time also these

271
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,180
here that seemed ficher to do the

272
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,220
experiments

273
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,380
ok the propellers did not arrive in time

274
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,520
for the on

275
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,279
l'om is the camping in holland for those

276
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,800
did not know we decided to bring the

277
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,170
same quadcopter because the cia there

278
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,880
will surely have been someone who

279
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,400
can help us fix it c  dares happens in

280
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,069
holland in holland

281
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,730
there was a talk on the quadcopter with a

282
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,260
stuffed cat

283
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,620
I don't know if you saw it on the internet a

284
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,820
guy when the stuffed cat died

285
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,110
with his hands open so

286
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,140
he put the propellers on his hands and  on his

287
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,850
paws on his front paws on his

288
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,680
back paws and he flew his

289
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,180
stuffed cat we curiously wanted to

290
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,190
go and see where to meet these

291
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,050
characters because maybe they had

292
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,320
spare propellers we went to this

293
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,339
talk with our beautiful

294
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,610
quadcopter in hand as soon as we enter

295
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:25,950
the tent the  presenter of the bulls

296
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,450
who makes us you are those of the

297
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,390
quadcopter of the cotter cat oh no if

298
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,790
you don't see that it doesn't matter and in the

299
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,520
end I don't show up the

300
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,640
presenter what he does he says

301
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,130
well if there is someone here from the audience who

302
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,700
wants to talk  some of his project

303
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:52,590
looking at me may well come on stage

304
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,440
and then I went up and explained a

305
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,220
bit my challenge in the quadcopter we

306
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,840
do not have the photo with c  ielo on phone

307
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,770
9 yes ok well we talked about this and

308
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,570
it was very useful because like us

309
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,800
there were other

310
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,660
quadcopter enthusiasts in the room waiting to

311
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,230
see the same talk and several

312
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,290
people offered to help us so I would

313
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,230
say it was a '  great move

314
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,600
ok we found a

315
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,330
very nice guy no he was very nice

316
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,850
that was very nice he was a german

317
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,600
and kind way

318
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,420
that if you help us we

319
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,709
found ourselves on his tent and we

320
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,720
started talking a little about our

321
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,209
quadcopter he didn't know

322
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:44,370
ours  controller this one here did not

323
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,139
have some riches for us but he

324
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,120
gave us these here which are much bigger

325
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,680


326
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,370
that work like [ __ ] but

327
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,950
we thanked him we tried to

328
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,750
mount this is there that we

329
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,430
balanced it what it means to

330
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,750
balance a sail of a  quadcopter

331
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,199
you see this little piece of scotch tape and

332
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,470
practically you mount the propeller on the motor

333
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,500
you turn and you feel the vibration with one hand

334
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,579
if you feel it vibrate the

335
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,740
motor affirms it puts on a little

336
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,410
scotch dress and starts again if

337
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,119
the scotch vibrates more all admitted on the other side it

338
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,520
seems less the scotch is fine and

339
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,490
you have to either add or remove very

340
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,260
simple you go ahead by attempts is

341
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,690
quite simple well it is

342
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,929
one thing that we would also like that we

343
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:39,670
want in our quadcopter is

344
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,100
that the frame is rigid we think

345
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,170
this beautiful frame this

346
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,800
aluminum profile as you see a kind of and

347
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,740
from the side it is nice sturdy in the sense

348
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,970
that it is not  it bends but the guy

349
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,220
told us that this is not good at all

350
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,540
so the fact that it turns on itself is

351
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,570
not good ideal for the frame of a

352
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,170
quadcopter they are tubes round

353
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,840
tubes or square tubes

354
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,250
so this too was a problem

355
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,190
in our quadcopter someone is

356
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,190
taking note

357
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,330
ok that said let's try to make

358
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,390
it fly anyway because in the end

359
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,920
oh well it will vibrate a bit it will not be very

360
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,320
stable but the important thing is to do it  o

361
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,790
fly right well

362
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,780
connect

363
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,570
we put on the new wings we cut

364
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,590
them we balance them we take out the

365
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,690
quadcopter we try to make it fly and it

366
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,720
does not fly it does not want at all well

367
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,560
the quadcopter does not fly it is not stable it

368
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,400
tries to turn on itself and it does not

369
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,130
work what is the problem

370
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:15,100
you do not know yes then to check if a

371
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,390
quadcopter works it is held in the hand

372
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,670
it is held in the hand without it is not necessary to

373
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,930
fly

374
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,790
me on all the guides I have seen it is

375
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,470
written to leave it on the ground stay

376
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,570
away because otherwise the walls come

377
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,540
in the eyes  e mori is actually the

378
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,190
right way to check if how

379
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,650
quadcopter works hold it in hand

380
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,140
feel where it wants to go to try to

381
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,080
move it

382
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,529
trying to move it so the propellers

383
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:49,380
should put resistance and therefore it

384
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,840
should give an idea of how the

385
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,820
quadcopter is working well the

386
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,929
dude tried it was completely unstable

387
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,429
what's the problem

388
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:02,669
don't know this here doesn't have

389
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,279
a serial interface then connect and

390
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,190
then  you can't debug so

391
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,429
13 euro thrown away

392
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:12,659
then we bought from him

393
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:15,320
this is a pretty cool thing it

394
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,690
costs we gave 45 euro used this

395
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,919
so he told us it was

396
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,769
his first so no

397
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:25,320
quadcopter controller this here as you see it has

398
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,419
a serial interface that connects a

399
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,210
serial usb converter now let's see

400
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,889
how it works

401
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,830
here as you can see from nothing this

402
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,190
passes us a bit this here is the

403
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,340
sensor board as you can see it shows the

404
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,250
movement of the quadcopter we here at

405
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:02,330
this point wanted  cry then

406
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,040
let's do a brief overview then

407
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,980
this is the quadcopter as put here

408
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,100
as you see roll pitt and the horizon

409
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,620
these here are the data coming from the

410
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,730
remote control now I have not yet

411
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,170
connected to that we connect to

412
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,080
see it all not series of

413
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,200
parameters for calibration  just a

414
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,030
graph that shows what is

415
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,650
happening to itself also the output of the

416
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:31,460
engines that here these can the four

417
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,490
bikes  re and says at what speed she is

418
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,320
driving well once she had this

419
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,700
here by the way this is very cool

420
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,030
because you can attach a gps and i would say

421
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:50,110
it is 44 euros very well spent ok

422
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,790
done this we had an extra system

423
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,679
to diagnose the problem  of our

424
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:57,110
quadcopter what was the problem in

425
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,490
our quadcopter basically

426
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,510
one of the problems of our

427
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:05,260
quadcopter someone wants to guess

428
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,410
the remote control receiver who

429
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,580
paid 80 euros with the airplane

430
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:22,010
I had taken then so the first

431
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,570
crash was not my fault this i

432
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,000
would say  that proves it is not because I

433
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,490
am not a good driver but because it is a

434
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,340
defect of the here mind for a moment

435
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,630
that I connect if you want to tell a

436
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,930
joke

437
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,050
well anyway in reality the first

438
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,720
time we connected the exit

439
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,170
we did not immediately check and

440
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,070
practically me  I remember that expected

441
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,430
these values here to splash to the

442
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,480
[ __ ] dog

443
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,410
no not the

444
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,040
ok ones because this is actually this in

445
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,450
re  altà was the anticipation of the

446
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,320
next problem vidoni I tell you one

447
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,760
thing to do a little against it is

448
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,470
very simple really in the only one

449
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,800
that if you do it with cheap things

450
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,450
you give yourself a bit more and this is also

451
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,250
the beauty so I recommend

452
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,600
economic things  because I learned a lot of

453
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,550
things really not thinking of

454
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,110
doing it in an economic way that is take

455
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,420
the economic things but know to

456
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,270
turn off the need

457
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,340
ok now strangely it is working

458
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:46,030
correctly as you can see when new the

459
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:52,340
controls work quite well and it

460
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:59,059
works now I can say ok this

461
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:06,800
accelerator there  if it were for the other

462
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,500
matter the fact of having a

463
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,929
ghost remote control certainly does not help

464
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:15,380
so this one has been eliminated here it

465
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,300


466
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,179
was the god who went in fact I

467
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:24,230
do not remember what it is but a bola only

468
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:28,040
however nothing now we have ordered

469
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,980
another remote control a little more serious

470
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:38,950
expense  70 euros to an lcd screen at the bottom

471
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,080
another thing that you know our friend

472
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,390
is that the ex who are que  sti here I

473
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,730
do not speak well of motor control do not

474
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,760
go very well in the sense that there is a

475
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,630
firmware that the firmware

476
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,340
a software a program that runs on

477
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,790
this microprocessor here the firmware

478
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,360
was not the right one in short and

479
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,850
then there is a film there  'open source

480
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,010
precisely for these small controllers

481
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,500
that allows better control

482
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,800
especially quadcopters for a

483
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,940
variety of reasons so what happens

484
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,100
you have to re program these to

485
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,160
reprogram these you have to open them

486
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,070
solder 5 kg luckily I am able

487
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,640
to solder well so we soldered 5

488
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,640
wires on this

489
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,110
controller  and you programmed it while

490
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,780
on the date since these here this the

491
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,070
one mounted but these here not the

492
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:44,990
hormones these I kept them fixed so

493
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,840
blocked with an iron clip to

494
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,050
weld when I connected the

495
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,880
programmer but from the iron coin

496
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,080
it moved and burned 1  so

497
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,600
a controller is also gone is not

498
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,560
really burned but let's say it needs

499
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,230
it needs a manual way  and after it

500
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,720
leads which is very risky and there that

501
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,960
spinning at about 3,000 revolutions per minute

502
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,210
after this what happened nothing

503
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,190
we arrived here after this we

504
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,960
came here to tell you about our

505
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,970
misadventures among other things in

506
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,800
the order of the propellers we had  also bought

507
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,530
another controller that as deluded that

508
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,690
it could have helped better because

509
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:35,020
attention this has an lcd display

510
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,370
but not the serial output so

511
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,320
nothing is needed so if someone wants it it

512
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,740
is up for auction excellent to start with the

513
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:48,170
quadcopters yes well this is ours

514
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,780
adventure with the quadcopter and you

515
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,250
earthquake in short

516
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,880
you have questions questions

517
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,200
no good here we are to give you is to

518
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,140
study before buying we have

519
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,760
studied before buying but they

520
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,540
obviously have not enough

521
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,470
if you can rely on someone who

522
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,990
already experience we have seen that

523
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,370
they faced when when you

524
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:35,820
start  on a hobby like this or otherwise you

525
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,610
buy yourselves because at 300 euros you can

526
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,870
check it with the iphone

527
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,940
but you don't have it  have fun and it also works

528
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,730
a bit crappy times of the interesting

529
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:51,450
carafa so you are not there you have

530
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,670
not dealt with the software part at all

531
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,070
not yet our

532
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:00,440
quadcopter has never flown as it is

533
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,040
we would like so much but

534
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,990
in my

535
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:15,110
opinion they are not opinions that you have taken into

536
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,730
consider the other two controllers

537
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,440
those based one based on arduino and

538
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,110
the other on stm 32 these here are all

539
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,840
based on arduino in reality here there is a

540
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,279
mega t the bigger one on those other

541
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:30,380
crappy ones instead there is

542
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,320
a maga t of those  a few pins are

543
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,930
however those based on arduino only

544
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,770
that this with 10 sensors and therefore has a

545
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,760
sensor for so a sensor for so

546
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,500
a sensor even pressure to

547
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,080
know how high it is etc.

548
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,460


549
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,310


550
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,440
if if there is a

551
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,390
movement you stop and you do not notice it

552
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,010
they have discovered that the

553
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:04,280
wrong type of control but yes here is

554
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,810
another matter is that here the controls

555
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,030
van  no good for the chromatic mode

556
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,010
which as you can imagine one more

557
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,070
difficult than the stable mode and

558
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,280
therefore it would have been more difficult to

559
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,460
control anyway at the beginning so

560
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,760
another problem that there would have been

561
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,080
even if they managed to make it

562
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:31,909
fly in place thanks
