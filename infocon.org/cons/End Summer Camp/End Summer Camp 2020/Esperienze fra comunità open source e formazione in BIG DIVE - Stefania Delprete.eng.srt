1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,240
thank you then thank you also for the invitation

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,950
today in this time available I will talk to you

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,290
about the community and

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,070
open source experiences we had as

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,749
sebastiano mentioned within three different

6
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:16,859
states

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,960
in particular then also talking about

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,590
open data and online training at least

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,599
I will talk to you  also of bigg d'hiv that one

10
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:26,910
of the topix activity and as mentioned

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,880
above topix was turin piemonte

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,460
internet exchange was born as an internet

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,690
exchange in

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,120
addition to cultivating the vine interven of

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,899
piedmont then also in other three pieces of

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,100
other regions

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,910
and also active with  with activities of

18
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,239
streaming conferences and training

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,270
information and in the most varied ways

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,140
I will talk about it briefly later and

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,609
above all in the training activity

22
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:58,649
from the point of view of the data of

23
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,010
Dr. sa science with big time

24
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,019
we begin this journey that

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,090
also wants  be a little motivating for those who are

26
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,790
continuing to do events even from home and

27
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,700
carry on the communities in Italy even

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,740
beyond it

29
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,630
will be a good trip d  In the origins

30
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,960
then my journey to the origins starts

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,659
more than ten years ago while I was

32
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,470
studying physics at the time I discovered

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,110
both open and proprietary languages like

34
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,289
but club that less in language and

35
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,810
above all also linux distributions at the

36
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,080
time now that the first [ __ ] up

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,960
thanks to a professor

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,880
who  it opened a lung for us in this

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,670
world and in alexandria where I was

40
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,650
studying they finally came into contact

41
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,760
in a more active way

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,540
with the community with linux user product

43
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,340
is from alexandria with which it was

44
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,450
also interesting to act not only as a

45
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,009
beginner that you were  who was

46
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:02,899
starting this path but also

47
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:05,110
organizing linux day

48
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,600
then and therefore having perhaps for the

49
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,910
first time touched a reality

50
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,880
in which one could contribute not only

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,459
from the point of view of participating therefore

52
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,050
among the communities but also organizing

53
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,360
events to take a part a little  more

54
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,130
important in the organization and

55
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,630
dissemination of this message

56
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,290
then for the ma  mma I

57
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,970
ran away from Italy

58
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,489
I found myself in London for a couple

59
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,269
of years or rather two or three in which I was

60
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:40,880
through an internship I discovered not

61
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,820
only the ruby ruby and java and

62
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,760
python languages in England not monty python

63
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,620
but then I am the  language and for the first

64
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,890
time I saw how raku work too,

65
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,280
so in a working

66
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,840
environment he was given space in the evening to

67
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,760
meet in particular for this

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,380
rapid project beaches

69
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:16,590
we resume from berlin to berlin I had the

70
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,019
opportunity to expand this fantastic

71
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,230
experience in contributing to being

72
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,090
volunteers to the  'inside of different

73
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,189
communities in particular mozilla I

74
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:28,319
met her in the summer during

75
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,560
a hacking moment that by chance

76
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,959
I found myself in dubai with mozilla's present pc it

77
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,319
is discovered after reading

78
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,870
exchanger visits reality it happened that

79
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,870
we were literally three friends at the bar

80
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,340
a person that i discovered the gare

81
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,189
comme a nu euro che or the omio scheme and

82
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:48,780
also the other person that you have which

83
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,049
side with  with set cards in hand

84
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:54,989
that it was decided to start doing

85
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,329
more events to activate the

86
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,010
mozilla berlin community

87
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,799
these but one thing that being

88
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,569
interesting I then brought it also from

89
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:06,840
linen and speaking of contamination it

90
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,909
happened that these males m most

91
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,599
part were my fellow developers and

92
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,209
then we ended up solving some

93
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,250
math problems with python code and

94
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,289
the next year I ended up this great

95
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:26,009
great must jam to present in a

96
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:29,940
great state mathematicians interested in

97
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,190
this type of games just how to

98
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,180
solve math themes using python

99
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,370
there was also a return of gotti

100
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,500
non-language game also disaster

101
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,349
started that on a beguine plast scale

102
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:48,270
I stop

103
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,000
finally returning to italy these three

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,550
communities in particular in which it was

105
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,539


106
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:58,620
active reported also in italy mazen

107
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,770
obviously one of the most aspects with

108
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,729
friends

109
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:05,580
mozilla starting to do some 20

110
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,650
in turin and then i'm good

111
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,380
discovering the beautiful

112
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,349
ital community  iana who does activities all over

113
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:16,259
Italian soil in particular also

114
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,139
treason festival

115
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:21,229
that I had met in berlin we

116
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:22,789
started to do some events in

117
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,699
Italy and I mention it because in fact stage

118
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:28,669
with the left also think about thinking about

119
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:31,610
the great causes that we can solve

120
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,469
together and quito this question

121
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,919
for those who would like to go deeper I am

122
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,099
interested in collaborating if

123
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,810
internet access to free software could

124
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,360
play a great role in solving

125
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,520
great problems of the equity of humanity

126
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,669
and of the future and closed festival thinks in

127
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:55,189
great and in particular of and 100 read

128
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,750
that about 364 million child men

129
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,460
that apple last year do not

130
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,360
have internet access in these

131
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,150
pandemic and restrictions phase as we know

132
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,240
this year was an explosion of

133
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,699
online lesson and therefore together  to

134
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:16,219
think about how both open technology and

135
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:18,770
internet access have enormous weight

136
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,909


137
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:21,379
and how in some cases because we

138
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:22,920
also have foreign companies

139
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,490
within the pro  pri human rights is

140
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,080
something a dinner that means everyone

141
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,300
if something is not there to spread

142
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,740
your work that a community that

143
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,810
maybe you have stationed where the lists are

144
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,590
created is and then logically in

145
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,400
contact with the local communities also

146
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,960
grouped by  more and more people

147
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,410
to work together on projects

148
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,870
then under the advice of a person in

149
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,480
giulino when I was a moment three jobs

150
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,400
but advised to go there then with as a

151
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,710
volunteer and from there I practically no

152
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,750
longer often therefore collaborated as a

153
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,110
volunteer in some conferences is

154
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,710
linked  python as with Europeans with which it

155
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,090
was in Italy even if rimini

156
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,000
that year in particular through this

157
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,120
discovery not focus that an association

158
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,740
if we want to hat that was

159
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,230
created by the founders of some

160
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,060
open source books gone science such as liu pai

161
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,760
pandas and phases  to keep these over time

162
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,210
in these open libraries so

163
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,310
that they are always stable and

164
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,880


165
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,760
that what p  It happened that I

166
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,830
started to do a bit of talk around a

167
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,600
bit of sprint particularly at the compound

168
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,600
to this python library the

169
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,930
manipulation of datasets especially

170
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,450
given sa in short used for any

171
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,210
type of project as sebastiano mentioned

172
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,960
I also happened to the east two years  ago they

173
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,910
talk about speech that at this

174
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,220
moment will change as a clever name and

175
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,130
with this I connect a little bit to

176
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,780
a large part that was my

177
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,510
stay back in Italy that is to say

178
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,730
to start working so peak

179
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,130
training in particular by doing

180
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,670
data science projects also in this  case with

181
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,410
data in particular of open internet

182
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,130
sizing and it is and above all

183
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,080
by training both students and

184
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,350
non-profit companies or not between turin

185
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,330
bologna mothers internet different places

186
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,400
what happened that a

187
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,919
big part of this training is just

188
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,380
this summer cox what it is  a

189
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,010
summer course this year a little changed the

190
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,780
particular things from inhabited of seven have

191
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,690
entered  more importantly this

192
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,520
training from date without machine

193
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,480
learning which meant that he

194
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,030
had also had the opportunity to introduce

195
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,950
some speakers and from the outside as for

196
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,260
example he was the developer of one

197
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,750
of the speech developers who will

198
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,839
probably keep the name 1.0  by

199
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,370
mozilla stt therefore speech to text and in

200
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,740
particular as boys

201
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,380
the Italian with you was launched that evening

202
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,350
on a project that wants to collect

203
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,500
as much varied voices as possible both for

204
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,810
projects or because each of you can

205
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,839
go to file both to train this

206
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:25,450
voice recognition algorithm and

207
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,460
own information I can then

208
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,200
answer the questions or

209
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,460
elsewhere you can contact me lidar 8 a

210
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,390
here in particular by connecting to the

211
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,220
previous one in this edition was on

212
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,670
mobility we also had the opportunity to

213
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,520
contact

214
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,440
the Turin to understand what open data

215
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,440
there could be  Helping to understand

216
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,660
this concept of mobility

217
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,200
the big wax traffic from the vote was

218
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,360
dedicated to space and allowed us to

219
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,740
collaborate with conesa with data from

220
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,650
space then pour the satellites peel

221
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,690
also innings that the institute of

222
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,970
metrology of turin collaborated by

223
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,520
giving other satellite data more than

224
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,860
anything else on clocks on

225
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,050
atomic clocks were very projects

226
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,550
interesting

227
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,240
and went very well this

228
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,810
four-week summer course between June and July

229
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,210
but as you can imagine

230
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,850
this year things have changed

231
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,430
as you go beyond space with

232
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,700
a pandemic and therefore it was also

233
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,950
the right year to go and

234
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,730
experiment probably  so

235
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,040
this year big d'hiv we decided to

236
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,590
divide it into four modules each of the

237
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,410
five days that unfortunately you can

238
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,910
imagine from the spring it has been

239
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,700
moved has been moved to september from

240
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,140
september october november december

241
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,230
each of these modules and at the moment

242
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,450
it has been decided to keep it  in the classroom with

243
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,750
all possible forms of security imaginable

244
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,830


245
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,860
will be a version a  hybrid bit in which there

246
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,590
will be talks online and others in

247
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,250
presence for some other projects we

248
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,100
do under topix for example roped

249
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,260
which are

250
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,790
this teaching of data for non-

251
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,680
profit and it will be entirely online

252
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,630
so we inside are also

253
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,390
experimenting with different ways for which

254
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,030
training in the most accessible way

255
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,000
depending on the cox we have in front of us and

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,920
the availability of the students the

257
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,560
class is almost entirely Italian this year

258
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,930
the last few years at the

259
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,610
strength of having a very international class

260
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,840


261
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,390
and in particular these four modules

262
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,520
briefly the module and will be  right on the

263
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,560
iphone and sweaty science spa that begins

264
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,140
this career with two talk

265
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,600
show stations from the titan series

266
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,760
the second module st galasso jaws

267
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,650
ronnie and klein and in particular with

268
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,440
a computer vision will be

269
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,580
mainly used by our colleagues at

270
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,200
easy fondation always as much wine  and

271
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,410
particular will be the talk on blogs

272
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,250
such as logos using machine learning and on

273
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,560
ca  lcoli these challenges with

274
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,920
datasets we will have an expert in the city now

275
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,260
who will try some interest after the

276
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,410
point of view the third will be inherent

277
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,970
suitable for smiles show

278
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,800
some javascript libraries will be used

279
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,410
how it affects yes and league is the last is

280
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,480
dedicated to the data engineers

281
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,149
with  different resources available and

282
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:43,279
therefore our idea and this point to

283
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,440
give let's say the four cornerstones in

284
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,920
data science and this is very useful

285
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,660
in case a team wants to go to

286
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,000
fortify an air is finished if you are

287
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,760
interested you can contact me

288
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,380
freely the registrations for the  first

289
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,690
module will start very soon among the

290
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,639
less contentious ones that at least tomorrow

291
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,399
midnight but you knew it right

292
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,440
in short let's

293
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,940
feel obviously you can imagine

294
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,070
the places are many imitated try us

295
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,779
two more places

296
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:17,850
each module is still there and I think that

297
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,060
as times we are there too

298
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,779
thank you

299
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,880
are question cards both on the

300
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,579
previous side of the communities in particular

301
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,579
I want to give you a wish  to all with

302
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:33,420
this because of continuing to do 20 to

303
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,399
continue to hold on despite the

304
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,040
difficulties of not not

305
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,810
holding back that there are some difficulties

306
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,269
in connecting in these times not even

307
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:44,250
connected we go on to do the teeth to

308
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,329
push other people to learn

309
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:51,240
new things  and to exchange the knowledge

310
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,269
we have
