1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
my name is claudio candese cod

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,099
in my life i have done many things i am a

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,190
software developer right now

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,089
at the university of genoa

5
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:19,189
for years i practiced judo until i

6
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:21,720
became a student instructor then

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,230
joined my teacher in

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,189
teaching judo i was still a

9
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,349
minor i couldn't  doctor who

10
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,179
had it my student that I carried

11
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,250
on for a couple of levels and I was

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,219
able to appreciate and learn how

13
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,809
to grow a person in

14
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,879
the martial arts because martial arts that

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,290
have marked me a lot in the way of

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,840
thinking and in the way  to interact with

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,879
people

18
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:47,579
if an argument is about to emerge

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,760
I am the first to try to avoid

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,890
conflict because this is what

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,539
martial arts teach when they are

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,640
done well when they are serious when there

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,469
are no excuses to compete and

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,210
compete with  others win

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,949
medals so when they become

26
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,189
extreme competitive spirit or when they are instead the

27
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,260
excuses and worse still to lead their hands

28
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,799
is qu  ello that several years ago we had one

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,830
in genoa i'm from genoa we had a

30
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,740
small association that took care of

31
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,270
bringing the computer with linux to

32
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,700
schools

33
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,600
even though we were few volunteers

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,810
we had more than 2100 remotely managed pc

35
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,229
in dozens and dozens of schools in

36
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,360
liguria we started  to deal

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,880
with cyberbullying because we saw that the

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,310
phenomenon was spreading around the world

39
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,210
and no one no one listened to us

40
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,710
all said no okay man

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,420
cyberbullying will never arrive in Italy,

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,119
imagine it's American stuff, it's a bit

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,640
English a bit American a bit German  a

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,799
little belgian a little french name in italy

45
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,810
does not arrive

46
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,560
after a year less than a year it

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,140
also arrived in italy there was already

48
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,810
actually the news arrived and

49
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,030
people began to magically call me

50
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,709
all the schools in italy had the

51
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,459
number  they called and told me

52
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,069
that she does things about cyberbullying or rather she

53
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:18,239
who does cyberbullying

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,730
I don't do cyberbullies we put

55
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,580
300 students in front of her  we give her 50

56
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,470
minutes so she scares the bullies a bit

57
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,450
c sensitizes others we are okay

58
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,920
so then I could get rich

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,739
doing 50 minutes of awareness

60
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,239
on cyberbullying to be the first

61
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,250
ever in Italy to do it

62
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,989
in reality what happened what happened that

63
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:41,850
I stopped for a moment we

64
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,140
stopped we said to ourselves if we want to

65
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,299
change things and we want to protect the

66
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,310
kids we have to understand how something

67
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,459
works hacker mentality that is when

68
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,040
you want to make an object do

69
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,920
something other than what it does the

70
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,989
first thing you have to do  doing is openable and

71
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:03,780
studying it the first thing it does is that

72
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,640
so what we did we

73
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,320
dismantled

74
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,120
cyberbullying we started studying dozens and

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,920
dozens of cases not only of cyberbullying

76
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,170
because then inside there ended up the cases

77
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,450
of solicitation cases of stalking

78
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,819
everyone's homes  the types of digital aggression

79
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,430
that is not cyber aggression in

80
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,130
one I start teaching kids

81
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,230
how to prevent  and a denial of

82
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:25,980
service

83
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,959
but how will it prevent a solicitation

84
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,810
of the pedophiles or a cyber stalking

85
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,420
that yes then the digital version

86
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,790
are people who attack other people

87
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,730
using technology well we started to

88
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,850
study them we discovered that it is that

89
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,590
there were elements in common

90
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,739
patterns that are always the same and here patterns and

91
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,310
are in fact attack techniques

92
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,150
we studied aggressions that

93
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,920
ended well we discovered that there was

94
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,690
the possibility of having defense

95
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,290


96
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,930
techniques sometimes the little boys and girls and

97
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,359
instinctively they understood the right

98
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:03,030
techniques to stop a  aggressor in the

99
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,540
bud

100
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,340
an aggression in the bud stop

101
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,689
the aggressor

102
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,790
we began to say say every

103
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,740
experience of the traction

104
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,190
of the duke fly this

105
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,910
and not only if we want to change the

106
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,798
mentality of the kids

107
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,269
of today's girls

108
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,370
we have to find a path that is

109
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,230
precisely there shape changes  the way of

110
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,290
thinking because digital does not

111
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,970
attack me or if it suits me  ccano

112
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:37,370
usually eliminated them quickly without

113
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,130
even getting into too much conflict

114
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,320
then because it does not happen to others it

115
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,690
happens because the kids the girls

116
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,430
of today are very reckless on the

117
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,330
internet they are the touch generation they are

118
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,020
a generation that stops at the fact at the

119
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,970
touch on the screen  but they don't ask

120
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,920
what's behind them apart from some rare

121
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,960
cases many of them take the technology

122
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,270
for granted and don't ask themselves what's

123
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,290
behind them and they don't trust them

124
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,500
too much maybe not all of them are generalizing

125
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,010
to simplify well we found  with

126
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,440
a class of 10 boys to create a

127
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,470
martial path then with the ethics

128
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,120
of martial arts the

129
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,710
teaching methodologies of the other mazzali

130
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,960
but the seregno c inside elements of

131
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,930
cyber security technology base

132
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,330
damn in three four months

133
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,039
we started to have the  first

134
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,360
effects a boy of ours affirmed an

135
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,810
attack and a girl another attack

136
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,259
by the end of the year so within six

137
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,850
seven months from  the beginning we started

138
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,759
in October it is May one of our

139
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,539
pupils of 13 14 years identified and

140
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,940
stopped a pedophile who pretends they were

141
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,590
pretending to be a 16 year old boy who

142
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,550
hooked her up on facebook she knowing that she

143
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,070
could do it brought him on whatsapp

144
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,530
in  so as to expose the

145
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,139
cell phone number she searched with the

146
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:08,720
cell phone number to actually identify the

147
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,340
first thing she did she also warned

148
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,349
other people because she realized that it

149
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:14,120
could be an attacker she didn't want to

150
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,699
be alone looking for that

151
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,289
cell number she  discovered that that person

152
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:20,690
was not a 16-year-old boy

153
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,449
so an adult violent

154
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:26,389
neo-Nazi obsessed with sex figured

155
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:29,389
without worries he called he

156
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,010
activated the safety net

157
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,289
then we did our investigations

158
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,449
we actually determined that

159
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:37,580
she had found the right things  it was the

160
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,139
first time he did it so he was doing it for a

161
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,789
while outside

162
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:43,310
of the don's exercises and so he was a

163
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,090
bit anxious

164
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,610
she turned him away she called him by

165
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,080
name with his real name told him

166
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,300
look I know who you are and he left

167
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,330
after which we obviously reported him

168
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,550
to the police

169
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,430
from there we realized that the

170
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,870
termination works

171
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,580
we have also been recognized by some

172
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,639
of the most important martial arts schools of

173
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,680
martial traditions we

174
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,800
also talk about ancient schools the main

175
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,330
martial arts schools of japan

176
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,729
as the natural continuers of

177
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:17,970
martial art in the digital world

178
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,410
you will notice that I never say virtual

179
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,440
because it is not virtual  but

180
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,000
we know that the stuff that happens

181
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,950
digitally is not virtual ok that is if you

182
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,600
make money from the current account

183
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,030
you have a nice saying that they are virtual they

184
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,449
are not virtual

185
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:36,430
in the zayed so we teach

186
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,120
quickly because then I don't want to

187
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,770
talk about putting it I have to explain to you

188
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,689
what the hell do I do and above all what

189
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:44,169
background

190
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:45,659
we have been teaching since zone c in the

191
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:47,489
closet sintex is widespread throughout Italy it

192
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:52,039
has become vo  lendo a profession has

193
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,059
developed professional skills

194
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:56,639
such that there is a course that issues a

195
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,689
certificate of professional skills

196
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:00,089
as a consultant mediator in

197
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:02,539
cyberbullying who is the only figure in Europe

198
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:04,619
dedicated exclusively to cyberbullying

199
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:07,139
and also recognized by the ministry

200
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,139
of research education by my  and he

201
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,729
is the person who can enter schools

202
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,469
to prevent

203
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:15,359
an active contrast if there is a problem

204
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,610
my name is the mediator consultant who knows

205
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,699
how to manage the situation can do the

206
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,439
next mediation the problem has

207
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,399
already been there

208
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,319
call me after the problem  there was

209
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,819
I try to reconstruct the

210
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,579
educational pact to fix things we have

211
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:33,029
training with obviously lawyers here

212
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:34,979
with psychologists we have a

213
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,259
solid strength training in what

214
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:38,909
concerns martial arts from the point of view

215
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,519
of the friend's tradition of the

216
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,759
way of thinking  and in technology and that

217
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,410
does not cause on the fly how you arrived

218
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,379
at the 3d step of this figure  At that

219
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:51,149


220
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:53,279
time we have relied on a

221
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,009
training school in Rome that already

222
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:59,899
trained the masters of physical martial arts

223
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:05,279
and the bulk I have to say the

224
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,110
bulk was done by the training school in

225
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,350
Rome which worked in agreement

226
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,500
with other information bodies  things in the

227
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,800
end is to make us accredit the course and

228
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,910
I must say that it was a great

229
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,329
result because those who now take the course

230
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:26,220
to become a zanchin tech teacher come

231
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,129
out with a double title with the title

232
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:31,259
of consultant mediator and teacher from

233
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,759
Zakynthos who can therefore make his own

234
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:35,279
sweet gym in the afternoon for

235
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,129
kids or even for adult courses

236
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:38,699
even now we are

237
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:40,860
also launching special courses in

238
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,199
companies to raise awareness, perhaps educate

239
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:44,170


240
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,620
the secretary and not to open emails

241
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,970
not to trust anyone,

242
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,620
there is precisely the mentality that needs to be changed

243
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,970
to have the safest infrastructure in

244
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,040
the world but then if the secretary is in bra

245
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,080
and the attachment because it says click me

246
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,900
not t  i need nothing so cyber

247
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,550
security awareness what is called

248
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,460
that and then you can have dessert in the

249
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,380
afternoon but above all if you want to

250
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,490
do it like theirs

251
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,710
you also have the opportunity to be

252
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,790
certified as a broker consultant

253
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,590
so go to schools you work a lot

254
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,140
with schools you really do

255
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,980
moreover obviously there is the problem

256
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,630
that they call you when when there is

257
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,470
an emergency in this lockdown I have

258
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,760
done the account

259
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,760
I have had an increase of 1850

260
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,730
percent in requests it is crazy if we

261
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,240
think about it

262
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,730
yes also because they are not

263
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,890
easy requests  there is the girl who

264
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,080
stole the instagram profile

265
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,290
okay we help her a shaman there is that other

266
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,690
adult lady who sent the

267
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,520
scan of her identity card on

268
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,950
buzz to a number that claimed to be

269
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,920
young from vodafone  she is a verified friend

270
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,780
the cassocks nice offer that makes me yes

271
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,580
yes I send him the identity card then two

272
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,870
days later she realized that maybe

273
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,340
it was not really it was not really the thing

274
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,310
you escape d  In the world, however, there are also

275
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,480
very serious cases

276
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,250
we talk about attempted kidnappings we talk

277
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,040
about the solicitation of minors who

278
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,310
risked ending really badly we talk about

279
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:20,500
things for which we must have a certain

280
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,900
inner strength first of all we

281
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,450
who intervene because we have to calm

282
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,580
the person in front of us  let her

283
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,800
breathe and above all take care of her

284
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,450
well-being then also welcome her

285
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,910
own and obviously then to go

286
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,080
to the police so they must be

287
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,340
collected in a certain way we will connect you a

288
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,710
lot with practically

289
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,270
all the law enforcement agencies that we

290
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,370
return we never denied the boxes

291
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,750
whoever and law enforcement still has

292
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,800
n't happened to call the

293
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,620
armed forces but at moments heaven you will have

294
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,420
gladly bombed news once

295
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,840
they don't let me do it yet and apart from

296
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,110
that we must therefore be very very

297
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,220


298
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,140
solid and for this reason there is  a

299
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,770
martial discipline said in all of this

300
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,510
today's theme since you told me harper

301
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,550
that you could  speak a bit of mal [ __ ]

302
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,820
of osint one of the practices we

303
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,010
have in zayed tech one of the

304
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,520
practices

305
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,590
so it is not the city that is not a

306
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,870
technology course it is a martial art that

307
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,470
makes you grow

308
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,560
from 11 years up to 70 and  beyond

309
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,620


310
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,770
stunned we define for a moment osint osint here is one

311
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,330
of the practices that we have hallows in

312
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,660
the laws int open source intelligence

313
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,780
are investigations and intelligence therefore

314
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,850
the acquisition of information

315
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,730
the acquisition of investigations we could say

316
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,970
investigations at open simoncelli where open

317
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,310
source does not  it means open source in the

318
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,640
sense of thalmann ok open source and in the

319
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,070
sense of anyone who can get

320
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,470
to that information the stuff you want to

321
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,900
publish on facebook is a poignant

322
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,880
open one because anyone can read it

323
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,700
that is a source of osint if I

324
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,230
have to do go on  you and I find

325
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,330
your profile anyway better and

326
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,770
start looking at everything

327
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,940
published on the public

328
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,720
automobile register where paying a certain

329
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,760
there  between which I believe it is 56 euros

330
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,640
from the license plate they tell me that you own

331
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,220
that car it is however a source of

332
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,990
osint it is not free

333
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,830
anyone can do it instead that I know the

334
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,480
date while the university where I work

335
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,150
that given a student registration number

336
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,270
he tells me the student's data and

337
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,950
I know where he lives where he lives that I don't

338
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,550
call him that it's not an osint tool

339
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,740
because no one can access that

340
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,990
data apart from authorized persons

341
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,000
however if I did it even if I am

342
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,860
authorized it would be at least  an abuse

343
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,040
of office and therefore it is a crime therefore open

344
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,670
source intelligence is to investigate

345
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,170
based on the data that are

346
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,270
publicly reachable for a fee

347
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,120
or that

348
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,640
said so it seems a fool is very

349
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,100
powerful it is used by

350
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,940
the armed forces it was born

351
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,270
if I'm not mistaken this stuff ranieri  to

352
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,650
tear is recorded with a stop no

353
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,660
we can then a true method is spread

354
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,640
because we can put some clouds

355
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,640
of that 3 but the rai cannot have then

356
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,160
it feels it  iraq has always existed not as

357
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,680
an osint term but gathering

358
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,800
information about the enemy based on

359
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,529
what I can see is if he has

360
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:46,350
always been there he can tell

361
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,750
stories about which the ninja the famous the ninja the

362
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,640
ones you know

363
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,620
you think yes  all dressed in black that you

364
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,910
can see only the eyes and instead

365
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,190
dressed as peasants or as soldiers

366
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,630
of the enemy army because if they

367
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,890
all dressed in the role of b they

368
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,200
immediately pecked therefore the ninja pole

369
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,060
number not what you see in the comics

370
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,470
the lynx what  he did not go for a

371
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,660
walk in the enemy city and gave himself

372
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,210
he looked around or went for a

373
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,589
walk in the enemy camp he

374
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:12,720
counted the loved ones he came back they said

375
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,600
year 50 dear because because I went for a

376
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,220
walk lippi he looked at what you

377
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,640
saw that is in a certain sense I

378
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,980
would have humint  because you send a

379
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,610
human being to spy he feels it has always

380
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,430
existed has become important in

381
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,500
recent times since the second war from

382
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,410
school and from  to beer ferment because with

383
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,089
the monitoring of the

384
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,490
television broadcasts of newspapers and then of social

385
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,700
networks the amount of

386
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,770
information is truly enormous

387
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,089
is also used by

388
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:51,170
political activists by investigative journalists

389
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,310
there is a beautiful podcast and also the

390
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,630
site

391
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,190
behling cat who are activists one of the

392
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,340
last things they did was

393
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,350
identify from some footage that had

394
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,750
appeared if I'm not mistaken on twitter of a

395
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,560
massacre somewhere in

396
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,560
africa massacres of civilians they managed

397
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,330
to identify not only when it

398
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,090
happened but also who participated in the

399
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,900
massacre who they were  those people

400
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,780
all done by intimate ozzy expert activists

401
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,970
around the networks was

402
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,380
obviously used by law enforcement is

403
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,100
used by private investigators

404
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,600
is also used by those who

405
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,910
are sanctioned each I'll pretend

406
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,900
his way so today I can am very

407
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,640
available to squeeze me like a

408
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,410
lemon I'm here I don't have a program and

409
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,630
I have a  bit of osint experience and i have

410
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,190
experience on this contraption

411
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,620
called malte go which is a program that

412
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,880
you probably many of you

413
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,010
especially if you are

414
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,950
Eastern frequenters and I want to say that I have

415
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,080
incited that I have come to

416
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,630
the East the  est was the first

417
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,510
public presentation of the tsar sci tech and it is the one

418
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,699
that opened the doors to us

419
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,589
there I met you I met

420
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,270
mario anglani and then I went to kim

421
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,970
bo it was wonderful because it

422
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,910
was thanks to the east that I

423
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,490
met you  a series of people that I

424
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,579
continue to esteem a lot and to whom

425
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,959
I really love that they allowed me

426
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,660
to tell this strange stuff that

427
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,310
they did and we can only

428
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,440
be happy for the earthquake

429
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,160
the scene that for that also allows

430
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,170
on the one hand and in communication of the

431
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,570
people and on the other hand to also give

432
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,240
ideas of sources of inspiration

433
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,830
in short so surely in this

434
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,000
case we have done what we had

435
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,940
set for ourselves yes in fact the problem  of the

436
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,960
digital east that he does not have in these

437
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,180
moments when you find yourself by chance and to

438
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,190
create with someone and you discover that he does

439
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:56,610
something

440
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,710
I said but then you put yourself unfortunately

441
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,990
currently I cannot be there with you

442
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,950
and but give as soon as you can but it will be alone

443
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,420
hopefully for a year then let's see what

444
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,380
I do

445
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,970
what can I tell you can tell I can tell you

446
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,220
about how we do

447
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,950
so how do we investigate

448
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,480
this strange tool that we use

449
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,280
which is called matteo which is not born

450
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,180
free but

451
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,340
there are two free versions that

452
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,940
you can  use and that it works very

453
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,920
well apart from the fact that you eat up the

454
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,590
whole era of your pc because so because it is

455
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,570
written in java and therefore also tries to

456
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,020
take as much ram as possible but it is a

457
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,020
monster it is a good tool I can

458
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,060
tell you about the mentality you need  for me

459
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,549
at least for what I do

460
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:51,299
because from my experience and I tell you

461
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,070
of ozzy in you I do a lot and I

462
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,249
do it on subjects that are usually

463
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:58,169
worrying that van  no then reported

464
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:00,149
to the police when they are not

465
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:05,460
simply cyberbullies various osint

466
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,529
on subjects of this type

467
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:10,679
taught me a series of things and so

468
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,289
if you want I can tell you something that

469
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:15,059
derives from my experience that is not

470
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:19,700
technical but is really life lived

471
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,619
I am at your complete disposal

472
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,899
if you really want

473
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:26,369
some questions maybe someone who has

474
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:27,779
heard about these programs

475
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:30,210
malte go and heights what we write a

476
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:36,059
side seal as mentioned above

477
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,830
an introduction has kept to understand

478
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,220
what it is

479
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,299
and then I tell  of the over the one

480
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,230
parking when you do

481
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,570
I mention the other I had really talked to the

482
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,149
people and then I can already reported in a

483
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:50,940
few things but making and keeping understand for

484
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,090
a moment this software where it comes

485
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,139
from he said it is that it is not

486
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:00,509
free software but anyway there  they are of the different

487
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:02,309
versions that you use so

488
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:05,119
first understand this I keep

489
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,509
focusing this software in short  to

490
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:12,299
ok we approach the questions but ok but the

491
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,850
trio as software then they maintain it is

492
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,009
a software the mind maps veil I

493
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,299
simplify in the simplest

494
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,330
possible way that now knows the matter oh well

495
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,129
but I fly feel like the star is a

496
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:24,179
mind map software

497
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,039
you have this when you make dots

498
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,200
he connects them with pigtails that is

499
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,659
what makes Matteo sore throat

500
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:33,359
even with a series of automations and now

501
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,059
we get

502
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:39,749
there there is an unformalized non-beta

503
00:20:39,749 --> 00:20:41,489
urban legend but there is this story

504
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:43,499
for which sometimes you take it an

505
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:45,179
information you put it  on bad weather and the

506
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,840
united makes the investigations lost no

507
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,919
forget that I keep doing things

508
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,210
on your own

509
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,980
if you think that a software can do

510
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,710
your job or it is a lot of work or

511
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,830
you do a lot of work

512
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,010
or you are script kiddies that is you

513
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,440
must know where to go  to make

514
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,519
investigations I

515
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,130
keep to the maximum it can accelerate the

516
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,620
most boring things that is one of the virtues of the

517
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,080
programmer is laziness and therefore in the

518
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,549
moment i  n which I have to do what can you

519
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:14,140
go and look at all the likes of a

520
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,000
page and I realize that the 32

521
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,299
thousand page I do it to a software because

522
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:21,519
there is never a niguarda while 32.000 but

523
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,350
I have to know exactly what there is

524
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,690
I want to do with the list of likes on

525
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,299
those pages so they keep a

526
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:29,470
reason for you I

527
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,659
keep if ever it simplifies your life

528
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:34,169
in certain things

529
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,320
33 terms that you have to

530
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,029
agree

531
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:45,080
on the first is graph graph ok

532
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,860
the blank page is the graph of mortar  go

533
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,260
is where you drag the little objects and make them small

534
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,440
arrows and the white page of the

535
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,000
new mental then there are the icons

536
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,270
the icons are the entities mars gole

537
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,720
calls this entity and itis what megane

538
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,310
that they do not want us to have the

539
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:11,270
message in chat where

540
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,870
people say that  is the output the webcam

541
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,000
is cut on the right and on the

542
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,510
left so right for gorese role

543
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,120
if we can or simply

544
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,010
move the writing is a little more towards

545
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,640
the center

546
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,050
and then in beijing minimis full screen  mo

547
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,970
sixteen ninths as he says we are at

548
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,340
four thirds this is called pre

549
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,100
four thirds ok then wait

550
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:44,000
let's move things let's say

551
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,470
that a problem we saw

552
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,520
when they appeared written

553
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,030
because by depriving it will actually have I

554
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:55,100
imagined it at the  let's see if put in

555
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,610
this way to be done

556
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,639
we see it well longer

557
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,500
it reads all French everything

558
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,620
is now almost too central but I

559
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,360
expect because in any case we realize

560
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:14,970
almost

561
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,530
46 look

562
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,270
now started so had made a

563
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,840
real-time tweak to my bs yours  bs

564
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,940
we have so many of those directing programs

565
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,620
that I probably speak ten minutes

566
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,220
later give life my voice graph the

567
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,490
white game entities the icons you

568
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,190
can connect with transformation the

569
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,580
automatic stuff that mal the go does for you

570
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,490
keep in mind these three things here what they are

571
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,230
'it's bad weather bad weather we compose mind maps

572
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,670
comes in four versions but

573
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,500
we download an executable only then

574
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,780
depending on the  license you pay

575
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,360
different features are unlocked

576
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,410
so let's see for a moment what

577
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:05,910
kind of my screen I can share

578
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,810
the screen in hand and I

579
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:14,150
guess if if you allow me maybe it's better

580
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,370
but it's a problem the platform if it doesn't let

581
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,240
you do it

582
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,260
then  if it shouldn't have done let's say that at

583
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,400
the difficult moment to provide I do not

584
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,630
share my screen

585
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,820
so off I did it now

586
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,560
we see it then and I show you the

587
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,380
home page of the company the company

588
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,790
called paterna which is a

589
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:45,480
South African company produces this is  the site

590
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,070
be sick go puntocom first stage

591
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,660
terra.com now they have practically

592
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,800
changed the domain

593
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,470
on a single product flagship product

594
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,990


595
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:59,640
the solutions that they have let's

596
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,050
see if I can show you the various

597
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:04,170
versions of mortar go to make you

598
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,669
realize features

599
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:11,909
of the  bad weather difference exists in

600
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:14,519
four versions apart from this one here which

601
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,159
is contact us then let's talk about the price

602
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,779
exists in these three versions one

603
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:19,919
version that is not even called

604
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,799
maintain is called keys file malte go

605
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,509
keys file before it was a separate software

606
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:26,940
now it is part of this of this bo

607
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,609
so there is the community version t and

608
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:32,039
what you find in dogs linux there is

609
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,980
the classic version which is 999

610
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,700
dollars for  single user for each year

611
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,010
indeed no sorry the first year

612
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,530
no for each for each year it had to be

613
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,250
and then the xl version which is

614
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,900
$ 1,999 per user for each year the

615
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,350
limitations that the free has is that the

616
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,600
transformations then I'll explain what they are

617
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,610
found 12  therefore very

618
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,890
little results that you can put a maximum of

619
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,650
10 thousand icons on the graph 10,000 entities

620
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,140
that are not few depends on what type

621
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,980
of osint you do in our case we will

622
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,270
go crazy in the case of a

623
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,410
journalist who wants to pull in

624
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,260
millions of information or the guy

625
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,980
who works at  born and file the mixed

626
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,040
maybe being able to put a billion

627
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,770
entities million entities sorry it

628
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:31,930
is convenient to access here to some of

629
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:32,890
these things  which are called

630
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,650
transformations but not all with this

631
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,170
access to everything but as you can see the costs

632
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,620
are very high 999 dollars a 1,999

633
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,120
dollars the free version of malte go

634
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,300
exists both as a community and something

635
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,100
called that in spite which is

636
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,110
mentioned below  somewhere

637
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,410
here it is kiss fi that it is another software

638
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,880
I will explain it to you even more simply

639
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,710
than I told you this is malte volo

640
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,980
you

641
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,270
can see for sure that we see it when you

642
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,650
open it I keep the first time you

643
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,100
install malte go you launch it and it

644
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,720
asks you at the first time

645
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,230
what you want to make you understand to start the

646
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,360
community edition version is free that

647
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,860
in spain

648
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,350
the classic is free but you have to give me an

649
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,980
activation key or the xl I will

650
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,750
show you to explain to me what is the

651
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,980
difference between these two versions

652
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,230
free and why I use the yellow one

653
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,790
because I use files

654
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,290
I will show you how many

655
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,230
voices work and the main difference

656
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,700
one of the main differences is that

657
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,800
by choosing mal de  go c is then i

658
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,780
keep real not eakins file

659
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,450
i'm asked to accept the license

660
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,510
i'm asked to register anyway

661
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,550
even if it's free

662
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,060
i'm asked to register on

663
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,480
their on their site

664
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:04,170
then it's here i'm going to get username

665
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:14,850
password and  we put on andria and at this

666
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,160
point malte go configures itself,

667
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,880
installs its entities and shows you if it

668
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,890
obviously connects to the site, it becomes an

669
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,570
edge because the edition and burgundy communicates

670
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,140


671
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,730
each product that chooses that has a

672
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,670
different color from those who use the

673
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,880
yellow one that community  edition in this

674
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,590
version on board

675
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:40,570
ok yes it's me next

676
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:44,230
yes you configure download things the

677
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,710
cloak free community edition what

678
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,100
you find on cali linux is this here

679
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,830
then maybe it depends on what version it is or

680
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,220
at least it is updated enough but

681
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,160
this is what in the meantime  this yes

682
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,740
here is that come on that ends come on that

683
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,220
you finish default ok privacy mode and then

684
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,270
if anything we talk about it

685
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:11,140
go away I know what I'm doing to the m  to

686
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,690
the theme I owe all the cloaks as well as in

687
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,169
style which is the one for the police

688
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:18,429
you can also use it never the one born

689
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:20,950
for the police the Maltese malte

690
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,530
go that is cie community edition

691
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,350
classic xl to this thing called

692
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,409
transform hub where  you can

693
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:30,700
install additional services

694
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,380
now the transformations i don't know anything other

695
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,409
than rob automations and boring ok for

696
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:37,659
example you could install what i know the

697
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:41,440
transformations provided by what i know from

698
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,700
block chaining point info from alias tb and

699
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,070
interesting but alias db di  shadow

700
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,409
dragon tells you this transformation

701
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:52,659
is not available with the version of malte

702
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:55,120
go tackle that you have because the community

703
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,789
edition which is the free one does not

704
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:00,280
allow me to install some of these

705
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,950
additional services and so for

706
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,260
example I should put free and go and

707
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,059
see which ones  additional services can

708
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:10,600
be installed like what do I know I could

709
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,500
have the wayback machine was the bond

710
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,210
sudan but for example you are at the showdown

711
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,090
will ask me u  na p who says dan so

712
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,600
you should have bought and have a

713
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,640
show key since many of these

714
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,200
services are paid in

715
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,400
addition to the 90 100 99 1999 dollars you

716
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,929
want to pay

717
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,220
but why pay for the transformations

718
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,540
I will show you quickly how it

719
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:44,100
works but at the go and  if it opens ok and

720
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,620
what the hell are these transformations

721
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,300
bad weather this is the graph notice maybe you

722
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,410
don't see very well that here it

723
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,660
says not for commercial news

724
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,960
because it is the starting edition version here

725
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,180
I have all my entities that I can

726
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,830


727
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,630
actually add malte go  he is smart so if

728
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,070
I copy it I paste for example a war there

729
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,720
he understands by himself that it is a war

730
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,050
there type if I copy c if I don't go

731
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:14,350
get me I know more rl I

732
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:19,870
drag it here I go to edit I

733
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,700
double click I go  to modify the form

734
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,640
and say properties of the war l end

735
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:33,550
summer camp and rl https summer camp

736
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,760
victory

737
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,940
here this is an entity if

738
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,470
I want I can add others then I can

739
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,140
connect them with arrows c  he

740
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,570
always have a direction one way there is no

741
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,610
arrow with two heads there is no arrow

742
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,130
without any head

743
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,450
this then for the type of analysis that

744
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:55,320
are done after if I die then the

745
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,790
main difference from what I use is

746
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,600
that the files that are free like this

747
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,490
which with edition but does not have the

748
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,900
limitations of the community edition

749
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,490
because here there are many more limitations

750
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,130
than English files is the fact that what

751
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,130
I use is not the transformations the

752
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,440
transformations are automations so

753
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,720
if I now on two re lady anne summer

754
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,600
camp I press a key  right I can go and

755
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,430
see the transformations that I can do

756
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,360
for example what do I know I can transform

757
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:32,209
this web there into a domain

758
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:36,530
he starts and says no and did not take it

759
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,390
fantastic then I go he tried

760
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,350
to do so directly

761
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,280
and paste here he already understands directly

762
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,740
that it is  a domain perhaps because I had

763
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,350
pasted a domain and not an rl on the

764
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,720
domain what transformations can I do

765
00:32:51,720 --> 00:33:00,090
what I know I can go and see what

766
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,210
I know the bns names

767
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:09,120
so I have all the host names do things

768
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,030
he thinks and finds himself of the entities apples

769
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,550
automatically creates he does not find

770
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,710
much maybe because I'm giving things at

771
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,950
random let's do something more sensible

772
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,750
let's go and see what 2000 of the

773
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,200
single 21 bis  cp address then it is the

774
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,240
summer camp should give me what is

775
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,640
the ip address of this if the written

776
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,690
right is because maybe I am wrong

777
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,930
the address

778
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,700
is coming to me we find with many things

779
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,560
I directly take bad weather then or

780
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,710
we try with zac hi tech crunch in

781
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,840
pec.  it I show it to you on our

782
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,870
site

783
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:54,070
via tutto in collo from shin tec.it

784
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:59,190
right click and then I can do

785
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:05,050
let's see if it finds some email these

786
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,850
transformations sometimes do not work and

787
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:11,549
this is a fantastic ip address problem

788
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,429
maybe I had to install

789
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,199
something in  more instead of

790
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,820
jumping directly to show

791
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,500
you you have transformation ppp ppp if it

792
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,080
transforms it into a love l maybe I can

793
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,699
use

794
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,739
that I wanted to show it I get up

795
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,060
ready funzi  onava then obviously

796
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,290
if I launch a machine the machine is a

797
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,210
set of transformations that works a

798
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,659
lot

799
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,380
there I do not find absolutely nothing

800
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,649
fantastic then I close a second to

801
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:47,480
explain language is nice of the live no

802
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,570
us too this is the 10 hours of live

803
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,780
we had to deal with  our

804
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,230
problems then in reality what

805
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,790
happens I probably have to go

806
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,450
install some other some other

807
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,030
thing here some other transformation

808
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,810
because in fact they should work

809
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:11,480
for example here there are ssl transforms and it

810
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:17,300
doesn't let me install that ppp balls

811
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,120
[Music]

812
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:24,470
for example  domain toulouse mind that

813
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,450
many of these do not let you install them

814
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,660
full contact twitter domain let's see for a

815
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,700
moment we install these no I wonder

816
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,120
nappi fantastic was in pole of the apple but

817
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,170
installing chrome does not let me

818
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:46,460
install it fantastic obstacle I will try it

819
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,890
will ask me ab see the problem of

820
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,130
malte go is just that then I'll go back and

821
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:58,430
I'll explain quickly what I do for her

822
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,230
trans  formation I am basically I

823
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,040
have an avoid homo rl or a domain or an

824
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,890
e-mail I right click and tell him ok

825
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,190
against me from this e-mail what do I know the

826
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,290
social profiles that are connected to

827
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:15,230
this mail transformation what is a

828
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,609
call to a  external server

829
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:20,670
so here the email address is sent

830
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,849
to an external server of a company

831
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,730
for which you have given

832
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,880
money to have a service is

833
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,999
sent xml containing the emails that is

834
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:34,799
analyzing the email address you are

835
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:37,259
analyzing return to the series of  xml

836
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:40,349
that create many other entities below

837
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:42,720
that they tell you here this is are the

838
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,650
results that I found this thing

839
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,539
works up to a certain point it works

840
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,170
in the automation parts for example if

841
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,569
you put me to install now the

842
00:36:54,569 --> 00:36:57,150
letras commission says dan you would see that for

843
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,519
example I on the  hyacinth site what can I

844
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,559
say let's go and do a little more analysis

845
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:05,309
on what are the p what are the

846
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:08,309
dns records what are the data maybe some

847
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:12,329
cruz I do between on d  I estro i say give me the

848
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:15,059
data of the queens and he automatically from

849
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:17,849
bash in the cut liters creates the entity

850
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:20,190
person with the name and surname of the

851
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,299
person who registered the domain

852
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:24,930
test the entity e mail address the andy

853
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,900
you ip address and slowly you can

854
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,940
go  ahead of analyzing

855
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,960
the infrastructure the list of a company

856
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,789
there is for example a very

857
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:38,039
nice transformation called company stalker which

858
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:43,609
is given on the website of a company but

859
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:47,069
to screen all the names

860
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:48,480
of the people

861
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,970
she  email addresses

862
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:55,380
phone numbers and it creates a lot of at t with

863
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,960
the people who work for that

864
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,960
company this thing about the community

865
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,380
edition is limited to twelve results

866
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,480
if you want to have more than 12 results for

867
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,329
each transformation you have to pay at least

868
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:09,809
999 dollars

869
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:14,309
if not 1999  plus the external service which

870
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:15,630
is a privacy problem

871
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,039
among other things because if you are

872
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,950
making inquiries to make an expert opinion

873
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,400
or are investigating a

874
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,680
particularly sensitive subject c  how the subjects

875
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,270
on which business dini

876
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,099
send an e-mail address to an

877
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:34,400
external server to find out if this guy on

878
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,710
social networks of other things

879
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,840
can be a problem can be a

880
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,230
problem

881
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,660
let's talk about it you are sending data of

882
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,040
an investigation there is an agent of the forces

883
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,100
of the order you can not talk

884
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,900
about what you are doing

885
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,040
you can not support in

886
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,040
external services so hell maybe one is in

887
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,460
china one is in america and does not respect the

888
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,620
rpg and in any case these doing investigations

889
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,950
on a guy and send his email address

890
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,720
to  a server in america run by

891
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,030
a company that you don't know very well because

892
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,220
they then tell you they make me out of bread not to

893
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,490
know if this guy on social profiles

894
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,560
or not for the other you do not

895
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,320
know where they fish from so as to come you are

896
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,380
doing an appraisal or  an opinion pro

897
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,060
veritate a memory something because

898
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,100
maybe the lawyer asked him to

899
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,070
investigate this subject you can't

900
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:30,040
then say boffo done right click and it

901
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,599
worked

902
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,829
you can find  and the way to say it but if to

903
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:37,089
be able to say no I did

904
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:39,279
this type of research because I will have to

905
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:40,930
see if by chance this email address

906
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,759
is associated with a facebook profile as

907
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:45,039
I did I did so so what holds up

908
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,390
a little more than  do not say oh well but he

909
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,920
did it keep it automatically I only put it

910
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,950
to the go done right click

911
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,280
who is wrong is the version I use not

912
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,339
to the transformation so not to the

913
00:39:57,339 --> 00:40:00,579
automatisms that allow me from one

914
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:03,700
entity who has to arrive other entities kiss

915
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,520
though  it does not have a lot of limitations to

916
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,010
much less limitations of the community

917
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,760
edition filed because I need that

918
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,070
file because we at zacinto xserve keys

919
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:18,880
file and it is not normal to go because we

920
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,609
do investigations on human beings

921
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:23,109
if you do investigations you are done penetration

922
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:25,810
testing and  you have the domain of a company

923
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,670
you want to know all the ip addresses that

924
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,500
correspond to that domain and then which

925
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,910
ports are open on each

926
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,720
ip address or fingerprint the ssh

927
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,160
or any  other thing I

928
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,130
keep it works it works very well

929
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:41,380
because it automates these things but if

930
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,970
you have to investigate a maniac who

931
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,010
is arousing a girl what kind of

932
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,230
automation do you want to have you must go and

933
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,670
read his facebook profile

934
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,040
if you have to find out read

935
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,480
what he writes see  maybe if you maxi

936
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,800
some cars but there could be the

937
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,930
same username it was also used on

938
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,640
other sites that could be

939
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,880
an automation but you do it also with

940
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,220
external services or you do it with

941
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,589
scripts that you can do not have

942
00:41:08,589 --> 00:41:10,060
all this need of

943
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,190
transformations  sorry how

944
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:15,190
a second me intervenes because I see you arriving

945
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,260
and how you were out of sync I wanted to

946
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,839
ask for confirmation if the direction is also possible for

947
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,000
them so it is possible that it is because

948
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,930
of my bs that is turning on

949
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,559
ah ok I'm afraid because in reality at this

950
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,150
moment it is not  I have a webcam and so I

951
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,130
'm streaming from a cellphone into

952
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,170
bs from ubs into you

953
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,890
anyway now it will be retrieving it

954
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,809
sem  good type marco giusti when he

955
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:45,059
was a corsair is basically so

956
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:45,780
what we

957
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,260
do we do not use malte go but we use keys file

958
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,750
I go to an infinite symbol there at the top

959
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,890
I choose cais file you do does not

960
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,569
require registration so for example

961
00:41:57,569 --> 00:41:59,490
for our underage students it is excellent

962
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,020
they can use it safely without

963
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,630
having to give their data to anyone

964
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,099
more members that you can also

965
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:06,869
add to your standard malte go

966
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:11,780
which are nt very cute terrorist

967
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,359
type then like I will show you the

968
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,609
maldini entities what mistakes typical of what

969
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:22,770
smile are sex offender gang member

970
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,220
military officer when i don't

971
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,670
know knife blade gun name you install it

972
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,160
all i know that at this moment malte

973
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,470
go is having some problems cendrine

974
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,599
java depending on what you open

975
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:39,000
together lover go interesting things can happen

976
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,650
for example do not open it

977
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,359
together with inkscape  because

978
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:45,740


979
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,700
anything we use can really happen, so it is ex

980
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,720
fi co  me we use it we use it by

981
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,380
mapping what we find online

982
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,619
in our surveys and the advantage of

983
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,660
keynes file is that the graph can be

984
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:07,720
shared it uses as a dinner layer and it is

985
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,859
for example if you are all on the same

986
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:12,619
internal network since it does not

987
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:14,750
exit your internal network  tested

988
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,850
with a nice powerful sniffer on a

989
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,250
particular network and I can assure you

990
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,130
that a bit rate did not come out at the beginning

991
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,840
when he has to understand if the session exists

992
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,060
or not then connects to the other

993
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,220
computers in the room and the session

994
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,430
point to point and you can have the cat

995
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,810
shared so if I add an

996
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,030
entity you see it we can make the

997
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,950
connections we can then reorder the

998
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,740
graph according to some some different types

999
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,020
of cascade sorting say

1000
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,840
standard and tree or

1001
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,260
circle type or in an organic way

1002
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,850
we can do analyzes by number

1003
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,530
of arrows that both  it has no entity or

1004
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,270
that come out in one of all analyzes

1005
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,070
that are done in the slip when you have

1006
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,750
from the al  too much data to

1007
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,310
analyze allows you to have an eye on

1008
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,960
what investigations you are doing and whether

1009
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,690
or not you are missing something during

1010
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:11,320
an investigation and allows you to keep the team

1011
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,760
quite close enough

1012
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,590
there are questions in the meantime I ask you

1013
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,060
why I am here  it will go to arms but

1014
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,910
we are almost running out of time

1015
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,500
then then one practice already

1016
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,200
answered by speaking because there is

1017
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,360
exactly what we are used I keep I know that

1018
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,460
there is a person who transforms only

1019
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,380
limited it seems to me that they have 10

1020
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,040
results maximum 12 while that inspiron

1021
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,750
the  transport but therefore own carmen

1022
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,770
short teresa escaped in the

1023
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:47,400
exact screw presentation and I will show

1024
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,990
you for example an example of how she

1025
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,750
likes to be with this excuse tested

1026
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:55,920
how many continue to share the

1027
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,030
screen without realizing it

1028
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,540
these are slides that I have prepared

1029
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:06,240
and it is a  real mile to this is a case

1030
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,730
of anomalous osint in the sense that I did not

1031
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,590
do it on a person on a

1032
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:13,080
potentially dangerous subject  coloso but I did it

1033
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,170
on a little boy it

1034
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,970
all stems from the fact that once a

1035
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,400
mom calls me and tells me I have a problem

1036
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,100
with my children's scout group

1037
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,140
because I don't want

1038
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,090
images of myths to be spread say he went back to

1039
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,310
cupid the  localization and now all the

1040
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,330
other parents are breaking the boxes

1041
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,680
saying that it's just me he

1042
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,500
knows he doesn't want to spread

1043
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,840
pictures of my children because of me they

1044
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,850
can't exchange they can't

1045
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:40,530
post the picture of the scout group on facebook

1046
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,260
and things like that and he has me  asked

1047
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,940
is not that you come to

1048
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,340
demonstrate what you can do with

1049
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,330
a scout group photo and honor it

1050
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:53,310
you bechi skills from the data I

1051
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:56,850
started from how the way the little luca

1052
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,820
I started from a long photo a

1053
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,410
child of 10  years he has no social pages

1054
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,380
his mother but yes the

1055
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,300
attack surface of luca we prepare the

1056
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,520
attack device is something a little bit broad and

1057
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,080
determined by the mother's digital profile

1058
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,270
from what can be sick I am

1059
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,970
parts  from what I searched on google

1060
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:17,070
scout group I took a photo with a

1061
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:19,680
group of people all the thumbnails you

1062
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,510
find in these slides have been

1063
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,750
altered so that you can't

1064
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:27,620
get what is the original photo from which

1065
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,740
I made these thumbnails so ip di

1066
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,690
bits are little confused ios cost a

1067
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,400
lot so don't pretend that you ca

1068
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,100
n't do it anyway or go back to

1069
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,100
the facebook page of the scout profile with the

1070
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,830
group photo of this scout profile

1071
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:46,030
and post it the place of the cover photo

1072
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,410
on the cost of the cover photo this

1073
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:49,910
it is the keys file graph that I

1074
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:51,370
made

1075
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:54,380
I find the scout group invites and

1076
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,510
the address so I already know where they are

1077
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:59,720
physically not only I go to analyze

1078
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,720
the likes of the cover photo and I discover

1079
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,030
that among all the various likes there is a

1080
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,150
particular one  that is the like that

1081
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:13,100
Luca's mother admitted to the photo here is that from

1082
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,540
her like I

1083
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,440
go back to the profile of the mother she began to

1084
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,820
study the profile of the mother first of

1085
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,170
all she is a single mother

1086
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:26,420
I understand it  co from that prescribes this and

1087
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,590
osint we go to analyze the posts

1088
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,820
to a photo of luca in a scout dress

1089
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,250
like the first day to the scouts and then

1090
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,960
I verify that actually the child

1091
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,630
who is fully seen standing in the meadow

1092
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,910
here is the same one that I find here  in the

1093
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:45,250
group photo it is him after the

1094
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,790
person I want to hit

1095
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:50,710
I go ahead we have a place of the first

1096
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:51,370


1097
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,410
communion which allows me to establish a date

1098
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,620
of the first communion and in a place where

1099
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,830
he made the first communion and the photo

1100
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:03,310
not only we also  the post of the first

1101
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,780
day of school because luca's mother

1102
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,520
is so proud on the first day of

1103
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,160
school she took a photo of her son in the

1104
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,580
home parking lot just before

1105
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,650
going to school or the photo of

1106
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,170
the house parking lot the photo of little luca  and I know

1107
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,420
what was the first day of school

1108
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:24,100
starting to narrow the field a post

1109
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,890
shared by my mother but that the place

1110
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,450
of luca's gym tells me that

1111
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,540
little luca does judo there is a photo of luca

1112
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:35,110
at  dojo I know exactly where the address

1113
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,770
of the gym is because it is an

1114
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:42,850
official place and there is an SD behind adoring

1115
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:46,330
doing a search on the mother I discover

1116
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:49,720
that the mother is registered with

1117
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,780
confindustria has a landline that is

1118
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,490
visible so I found the phone

1119
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:57,460
fixed by the mother and looking for the

1120
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,470
particular profession that luca's mother does

1121
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,330
on all the true data and these

1122
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:02,620
here are true data for what I

1123
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,750
altered because and luca really exists his

1124
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:08,380
name is not luca but he really exists

1125
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,610
I find what the address is  and the

1126
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:15,700
residence of mum and luca because she

1127
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,320
works from home in a

1128
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,110
particular profession to the studio at home i

1129
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,280
found her mobile

1130
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,770
phone her e-mail and precise address of

1131
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:26,290
residence as i know it is the same place

1132
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,690
of residence well i google street

1133
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:28,930
view i

1134
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:30,670
go  to see how the parking lot

1135
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,080
of that house and combination in the

1136
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,180
same parking lot where

1137
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,100
she took the photo early in the morning on the first day

1138
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,360
of school to her son

1139
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,120
I go ahead she works as I know  there as a

1140
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,620
volunteer in a voluntary association

1141
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,730
at the address

1142
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:46,410
of the voluntary association she goes there

1143
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:47,460
every Wednesday evening

1144
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,370
the question is leave luca alone at home

1145
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:53,970
because she is a single mother not only

1146
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:55,650
do we have the place of luca's birthday

1147
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:58,140
and therefore we have in the photo  of the

1148
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,670
birthday of the post of the birthday of

1149
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:01,440
luca we have the date of birth of luca

1150
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,690
and we have a photo of his cat because

1151
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,070
he is holding the cat and the

1152
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,710
long of the comments says but how cute

1153
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:13,290
your cat I know saccottino one comes to

1154
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:14,970
mind  snack

1155
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,500
I know that his cat is called

1156
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,130
saccottino

1157
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,160
which is not an information also

1158
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,630

1169
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,900

1170
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,279

1172
00:50:50,049 --> 00:50:51,819
night every Wednesday night my mother

1173
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:53,170
goes to volunteer in this

1174
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,119
association and maybe leaves little

1175
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,809
Luca at home alone what is there  he wants to

1176
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:01,089
approach little luca on the street and

1177
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:03,339
say hello you don't remember me

1178
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:04,599
we saw your grandfather's birthday in

1179
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:07,809
the restaurant the silver fork

1180
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:10,809
this day here how is

1181
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:13,680
your cat too cute that cat

1182
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,970
looks at them massei on foot when a

1183
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:18,899
passage  get in the car

1184
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:21,250
this is an example of what you can

1185
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,950
do with losing so good as an

1186
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:27,670
example that we had to leave them

1187
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:30,370
because the example was born for now

1188
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,290
legs that if we had presented it the

1189
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:35,020
parents of the smoky gut scart there would have

1190
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,790
been a wave of  panic

1191
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:39,880
and then we never presented him to

1192
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,010
this scout group and we did

1193
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:45,190
some more live things because they colluded

1194
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:48,040
this and a work one a work  of

1195
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,270
a single operator

1196
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,980
imagine what can be done if there are

1197
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:55,780
three or four of us present above criteria no

1198
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,230
it reminds me a lot of videos that were shot on

1199
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:02,190
youtube a few years ago of a sorceress

1200
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:06,580
trying to tell people the things that

1201
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:10,090
concerned it was table behind a

1202
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:11,980
team of people who  they were looking on the

1203
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,720
internet so they were connected with

1204
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,080
the headset the sorceress and the salsa was a

1205
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,110
thing of this style is of this type

1206
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,920
what I can tell you

1207
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,260
in my experience and here I share

1208
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:27,490
my human logical experience

1209
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:30,670
we teach it to kids after a

1210
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:34,960
year and  half two of b discipline and they

1211
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,790
know they will never have to use it

1212
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:38,230
for stalker areas the boy the

1213
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:39,850
girl he likes also because it doesn't

1214
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,530
work if anything as a kid you tell them I know

1215
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,510
everything about you where you live where you

1216
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:45,340
had it we had to reverse on this escape

1217
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,020
is not that  he falls in love with you so it doesn't

1218
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,520
work

1219
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,340
but people a weapon

1220
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,470
I know people personally I have

1221
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,680
known people who

1222
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,890
have done osint s to try  ui their family members and

1223
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,860
have discovered things that they

1224
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:05,910
would not have wanted to discover how every weapon

1225
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,250
like a gun like a sword how it

1226
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,750
is taught how it was taught to

1227
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,370
samurai how it is still marked today

1228
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:15,300
that a sword is not extracted until it is

1229
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,470
necessary because if you find out like this

1230
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:20,550
trying to suggest on your

1231
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,140
parents that your mother while

1232
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,700
crowning her father is enough

1233
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,060
or that your uncle is a

1234
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:30,060
choreography addict is featured on three four

1235
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,420
escort sites because he is a

1236
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,400
sex maniac then how do you look ignorance in the

1237
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,170
eyes of these

1238
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:40,730
people for  cite the

1239
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:45,380
matrix ignorance is good you cannot you cannot

1240
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,880
erase from your mind what

1241
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,070
you have known that if you know I

1242
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,770
happened to meet or rather they introduced me to

1243
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,900
a person that I had

1244
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,280
investigated six months earlier

1245
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,200
because he was a guy who sent photos of the

1246
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,320
his penis a 12 year old girl and it has

1247
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,880
also already been obviously reported

1248
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,710
when they presented it to me the first

1249
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,770
thing I want right away  no rough types

1250
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:08,540
luckily that in my head

1251
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,840
since I do it a lot

1252
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,910
the first thought must be because I

1253
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:15,830
know things about you that is, you have to start

1254
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:16,970
changing your mentality

1255
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:19,640
without testori introduce you to the person

1256
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,170
you are shaking hands and you think why

1257
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:22,300
I know

1258
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,190
you we met no I know you you

1259
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:26,390
don't know me because I have investigated

1260
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:28,310
instead of I have also already reported to the

1261
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:29,540
police one ago in just

1262
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,550
eighteen the skies to meet you and

1263
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,560

1264
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,890
josip is a is a '  very powerful weapon and must be

1265
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:40,730
kept in the sheath it is exercised yes you can

1266
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,350
exercise it on the guy who sells the

1267
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,840
moped on immediately.it do some tests

1268
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,540
find what this person has succeeded

1269
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,050


1270
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,330
delete the data

1271
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,560
because you have simply done

1272
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,350
an operation but I never do it alone

1273
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:59,000
also because fascinating and then

1274
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,380
you end up in it and you can't

1275
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,220
get me out and it can hurt even

1276
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,900
your mentality then started working

1277
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,900
as a hunter who p  always greased with

1278
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,450
the prey and it is not a healthy mentality

1279
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:14,660
it takes longer good then thank you very

1280
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,130
