1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,950
thanks if not

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,890
then what happens we are in the last

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,870
day of a penetration test that

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,410
we find an it sector with the

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:18,039
source code of the internet or they get

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,400
to use a late movie about dude

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,560
if on pc it comes after the ones you see here

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,570
because it is the stream anyway  and delayed

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,180
by a few seconds clearly loaded

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,000
a perfect commercial and it happens

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,559
practically every time it sells two

12
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:37,210
days when you have not asked for at least

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,570
8 or I reconnect the friend asks you to

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,900
do is a review of his product and

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,470
obviously he pays you in psg it was therefore

16
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,750
friendship

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,430
a more serious way

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,500
while you have a few free hours and want to

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,240
find want to look for some

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,150
open source precautions

21
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,070
follow our antani method for a

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,930
100% guaranteed success who

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,420
am i am presented quickly first

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,420
if but always up to cute i like to

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,460
write break this lesotho

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,180
especially in the next more or less

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,100
twenty minutes 22 we see those that

28
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,940
we manage to use I try to

29
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,770
direct them here  she who I think is

30
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,280
more lyrical milk fine old attempts or

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,460
if cures against cords belongs to

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,060
jokes

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,940
obviously loads very very

34
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,680
frequently that we have little time to

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,280
do something for indeed I would say

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,259
practically always it is so

37
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,140
in these cases it is essential to

38
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,770
be able to reach the  'appreciable objective to

39
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,770
know what we are looking for where to

40
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,070
have it makes of how to look for it and

41
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,560
above all to terminals what will be the use of

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,960
what we are looking for

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,060
here had given a little bit the rule

44
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,769
of the 5 w the Americans nor obviously they

45
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:14,040
are 40 doing in about 5 more and

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,040
above all about in this bull  that

47
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,290
corrosion in reality is not a

48
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,480
precise thing as one might expect is

49
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,690
the last one had the gun is dictated

50
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,890
by the experience of what is the

51
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,100
practice

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,140
before leaving a small very fast

53
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,200
disclaimer

54
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,720
[Music

55
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,790
] we start to do with review a  do

56
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,700
these of the age we are usually a

57
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,160
little hesitant the problem that very

58
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,400
often I am struggling which is what we

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,780
will have the  the fact that all software

60
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,750
has bugs and if it does not work even

61
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,250
if not for security this does not matter

62
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,490
but all of me will keep the pacs

63
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,100
some of these are listenable here it is

64
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,550
possible to take advantage of these bars

65
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,740
some will become so in the future because

66
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,970
according to the technique or  because someone

67
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,040
else from a slightly different point of

68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,780
view ours who manages to exploit this

69
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,099
want this bug

70
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:21,379
no software has suffered enough to

71
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,420
run anymore nobody

72
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,890
consider google has a brother of

73
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,340
google there are people who are

74
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,959
more skilled crali in the world for what

75
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,579
it concerns the nerd that security

76
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,230
is a hardware point of view that from a

77
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,049
software point of view is

78
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:41,090
there for all to see also their vulnerability

79
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,019
so there is no code that has

80
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:47,560
been subjected to not suffix inter code review

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,819
this because

82
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,650
feature protectors come  it means new interactions

83
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,730
between the already existing functions and redone

84
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,459
of the code that maybe introduces new

85
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:00,230
turns all  'inside the code so

86
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,200
what was previously a given past but

87
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,299
great let's say healthy is no longer the secret a

88
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:10,430
godsend for those who file and work

89
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,590
well growth but also very often

90
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,120
problems very much if there are

91
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,220
underneath them because they are going to look for

92
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,330
vulnerabilities  sensational and the small ones are ignored the

93
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,560
small ones that world often

94
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,290
chained to have small create more

95
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,880
problems than those h another

96
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,920
thing that we tend to underestimate is that

97
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,800
no vendor is big enough to

98
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,580
have the code it writes to ensure

99
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,090
that its  code undergoes a

100
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,260
correct production of a sufficient

101
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,080
view and take the example of google

102
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,970
we know very well that even checkpoint

103
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,950
to a

104
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,610
team of researchers and very very

105
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,550
strong really good but even if

106
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,319
its problems

107
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,330
we can talk about cisco sys colella

108
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,250
sandro great par excellence

109
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,189
milingo of vulnerabilities in its

110
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:14,479
products no vendor is enough is

111
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,799
large enough to have

112
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,509
enough people more s  believe that the

113
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,179
verify now that

114
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:23,579
this is written also because because the more people

115
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:26,339
write code the bigger the collins base is to

116
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:28,019
check with more people we

117
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:30,400
would need to lose if dear with

118
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,919
paradoxically it is probably easier to

119
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,199
find a small iaconis company that

120
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,940
has suffered a correct one or three viruses

121
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,480
compared to leagues

122
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,220
this for several reasons

123
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,580
if you want to start doing madre view

124
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,789
pardini on the hand on the arm these

125
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:53,479
three rules all software have beards

126
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,400
that have not yet been found

127
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,040
the worst for islands that you can

128
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,150
do instead is to start

129
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,000
avoiding running thinking  that someone more

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,010
capable than us has already done the same

131
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,670
thing then you certainly true that

132
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,220
someone more capable than me of you has already

133
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,010
done a lot of security on the source code

134
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,150


135
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,560
but it is not said that they have had

136
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,250
enough time to make a really effective review

137
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,270
what to say very very important

138
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,110
in this kind of activity and

139
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,360
experience is very important  and the

140
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,510
background of those who approach the activity

141
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,660
itself matters a lot

142
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,610
I have an experience where they are

143
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,840
listened to you have another that certainly

144
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,080
different our background will give us the

145
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,249
opportunity to read

146
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:52,439
and interact with the sources of the code

147
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,759
in a different way

148
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,289
our experience will make us verify

149
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:01,319
one thing rather than another

150
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,759
these big differences in the background

151
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,589
and in the experience come out very

152
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:10,129
amplified when the time is short and

153
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,529
therefore more than following the seven tual spawns

154
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:17,459
between the bills you should always read

155
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,430
arm they

156
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,960
are very very  practice the

157
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,850
best thing instead as a barrier you can

158
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,540
do is

159
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,780
start by

160
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,720
passing to reasoning not connected if

161
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,280
you were to be a book then for you

162
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,000
a page 1 chapter 1 but reasoning

163
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:46,509
when at the door of the code then

164
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:49,339
having in mind that difference

165
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:52,849
between being  and between hearing and this thing

166
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:55,069
clearly will serve you not only if

167
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,829
you want to do a bit of a security point of view

168
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:59,719
sleeves if you are

169
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:01,489
looking for barak fu  ntionals or if you want

170
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:04,579
to factor in everything it means you

171
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:08,820
must start reading the code and

172
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,130
for functions and not very trivially for

173
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,040
web applications from the php point

174
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,100
lines so we think by functions and not

175
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,540
by page number

176
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,770
this year opinion are the

177
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,390
main things  that you need to know when

178
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,150
before starting to do code review

179
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,510
those to get into the mood and the

180
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,280
state the year has corrected

181
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,440
returning at about 5 w

182
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,870
what we are not going to look for what we are

183
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,370
interested in is mainly these

184
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,080
four points that you see are the things

185
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,210
juicier what in the jargon are

186
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,840
called the web includes those read the

187
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,160
fruits easier to harvest is not

188
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,290
all you can try but

189
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,810
[Music] it

190
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,300
is evident we are trying to

191
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,610
practice 20% of the time it

192
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,700
takes for an activity to pull

193
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,029


194
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:05,650
out about eighty percent of what

195
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,520
a complete result would be

196
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,370
are the things we

197
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,019
mainly look for are the ones that can

198
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,490
pay d  the most in terms of

199
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,490
satisfaction and are the ones that can

200
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,649
create the shortest you want to give

201
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:26,079
because as soon as attacked at this

202
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:27,639
moment we are interested in the right

203
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,440
lateral movement and I assume that

204
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,910
you know what it means in these

205
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,980
terms if you do not know I am on you can

206
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,630
send me  of meters from what you want

207
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,480
also in the next days

208
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,910
here we forget lateral movement

209
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,920
we try to concentrate on the points 14

210
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,880
where where I go to look for them ideally

211
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,080
everywhere

212
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,190
but it is unlikely wherever it has an

213
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,170
interaction with the user so there is an

214
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,600
input output with the  'user

215
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,760
became the same complex world

216
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,480
because small applications perhaps have 20

217
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,740
30 precisely interaction with the user

218
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,510
applied are no longer large can

219
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,970
give a few billions and earnings per

220
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,270
share it becomes probable to verify them

221
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,340
all in our hatred and tancredi

222
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,680
therefore reasoning in 20  percent of

223
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,540
time to devote what we are going to

224
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,650
check login functions

225
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,080
descriptions the what  it can be

226
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,180
done in the profile very often

227
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,520
avatars are loaded there are descriptions there

228
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,800
are comments or almost of this type

229
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,379
or the messages that are very often

230
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,519
and well verified but it was not an

231
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,189
example the black v said big company

232
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:54,979
for last week not

233
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:56,720
sufficiently verified  and then

234
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,139
we try to understand which are the points

235
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:02,929
where we are most likely to find

236
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,359
something that can be relative to

237
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:08,329
our 8 of the previous point so

238
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:10,220
we will go to look for what

239
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,079
interests us where where we are most

240
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,980
likely to find them

241
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,050
because we go

242
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:23,250
and

243
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,470
something usually yes  what you are looking for

244
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,790
is one of the bikes that

245
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,680
sharpens something that allows us to

246
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,560
get control immediately and the application

247
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,399
of the server is not always the highest

248
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,300
paying point a paying demigod this because

249
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,540
you think and an arabesque nembro data on

250
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,600
this  I am not interested in running code

251
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,970
only from the sleepers to make water and

252
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,279
the loved one in possession of that data

253
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,629
the objectives posson  or be even much

254
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,100
smaller than those we

255
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,740
see listed here may be as

256
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,950
I said slightly

257
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,690
small vulnerabilities that we go to

258
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,020
concatenate with others so if I can

259
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,300
impersonate a powerful I can read the

260
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,070
messages from the powerful maybe I go to

261
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,470
read messages from bus lines and collect

262
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,300
information in allows  to import three

263
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,910
bindings and all this kind of thing

264
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:21,140
less we think for really

265
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,580
big goals but we try to keep focus

266
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,920
one thing that seen is frequent nutrient

267
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,060
is that unfortunately to give oneself a goal

268
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,130
is to put on the blinders

269
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,700
this is a huge mistake huge mistake

270
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,260
because example  trivial if the reserves of

271
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,959
an action sequence I check all the

272
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,450
code that also revolves around the

273
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,390
databases but totally ignores maybe

274
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,930
other vulnerabilities that are much more

275
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,330
foolish or simple to listen to

276
00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:00,440
so it is essential to focus

277
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,720
because we have said the time we

278
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,730
want we can devote is little

279
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,070
it is crucial not to keep cheating  cchi

280
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,560
why because if matera brocchi

281
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,850
we do not see things that are simpler

282
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,890
go and listen here they are a little

283
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,360
immediate compared to our

284
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,200
main goal so focus

285
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,830
your eyes open

286
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,029
as the most difficult thing of

287
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:31,560
course I am telling about

288
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,860
something creative about my path is

289
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,589
what my experience and we know

290
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:40,529
that there are tools both in the rooms

291
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,540
and free that do

292
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,180
static code analysis some work

293
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,920
decently some comai some a little

294
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,320
worse it was not the task of this

295
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,620
tonic we are interested in going to look for the unit

296
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,150
skills that are not there  easily

297
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,810
found with this if nardis comments

298
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,070
then in part also those that can

299
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,460
be considered vulnerabilities and

300
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,250
logic of relative to the flow of the

301
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,810
application itself

302
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:15,089
if with the possibility

303
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,140
a ride on the sovereign

304
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,000
application the web applications in this is in this

305
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,290
example because they are the ones  which I believe

306
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,710
we all see continuously from the

307
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,330
morning with the  wake up but if we go to

308
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,850
sleep like this they are the most false to

309
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,560
understand and the easiest to

310
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,240
approach also because we will not have to

311
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,270
experience

312
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,680
a quick tour on the web application

313
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,800
allows us to see to understand even if

314
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,350
a nature to understand what are the

315
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,020
most and potentially the functions

316
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,940
interesting clearly not the first

317
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,120
time maybe at the head fifteenth

318
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,810
application that

319
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,820
and on the collaborate you start a

320
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,510
little bit to have the truffle let's say

321
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,120
then to understand which are the points where it

322
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,690
is partly probable on the other it is

323
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,260
fruitful to find mark finding mo

324
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,750
in the coveted immediately after what  what do

325
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,610
you take a look at what the

326
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,210
structure of the code then understand how

327
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,250
the tree what are the bases of

328
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,920
exposed directly deaf as truth and

329
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,180
those that are instead included therefore

330
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,940
out of the how due to check where they

331
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,650
are supported by the storms here not

332
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,870
you do when you were archiving costs

333
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,440
this type

334
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,070
and understand if and which tibet and part

335
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,940
are used and everything in at  tivity of

336
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,580
collecting information which can then be

337
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,670
useful 3 the real vulnerability reserve phase is very useful

338
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,360
to

339
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,250
start what you do you start using

340
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,930
grappa where you

341
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:13,149
perfect then and greta is to say the

342
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:15,370
tool from which you start with

343
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,540
it  queue all it using the spheres of the us

344
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,160
trendy four

345
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,420
[Music]

346
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,760
rather easy to find

347
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,790
and vulnerability in the banal room is

348
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,910
very important too many planning

349
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:37,130
as important as it is underestimated the

350
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,020
capital l what it does allows you to

351
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,089
exclude

352
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:44,600
from the rep the files that are a side

353
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,790
bar gaza  as in their home it

354
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,720
happens very often especially

355
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,160
php applications that the files begin

356
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,120
with an include the one that verifies

357
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,649
the authentication the authorization to

358
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:02,389
see that file and the functions that are

359
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,960
inside

360
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,240
if you are hours the file will then show

361
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,920
all those who do not breach

362
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,470
so there is a page exposed

363
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,669
that not for which the

364
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:14,020
authentic fia of the

365
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,589
authorization is not verified that way I know that

366
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,459
whoever has so much  o possible unauthenticated

367
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,630
are point his so very very

368
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,520
interested

369
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,199
another very very very very

370
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:29,260
important thing is to take notes of

371
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,770
everything that is also uninteresting for it

372
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,830
is very important because, however

373
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,960
fast an activity of catching Juve can be, it

374
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,419
does not bring  away but at less

375
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:42,039
than eight hours

376
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,299
if we do not have at least eight hours to

377
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:47,789
invest, even if not consecutive, however,

378
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,640
in the nearby movements it is useless to leave

379
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,750
because you do not have time to become

380
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,580
familiar with the source courage

381
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,580
so you in fact lose time and

382
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,440
what I feel now  I don't know

383
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,230
if I will need it so if I also have the

384
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,150
small sector that can be useful

385
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,400
I always have a part and how

386
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,810
I regard it as I try other

387
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,060


388
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,190
things I have already said it before attention one thing

389
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,820
the codon does not start there  page 1 of the

390
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,850
book starts the page that your

391
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,220
happy experience is the most

392
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,270
interesting point that you practice

393
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,040
if you do not have that you have to leave for goals

394
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,500
the previous slide of the d  where and look at

395
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,380
those functions as a starting point

396
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,100
now

397
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,500
I believe that on things in this talk it is the

398
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,169
next but because I will show

399
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:45,030
you keep in mind that it is far from

400
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,730
complete because they have and complementary in the

401
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,429
meantime why not have a slide

402
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,080
and not above all because we are  speaking

403
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,650
of 80 20 so it is that we want to

404
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,870
cover 100 percent we will hit

405
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:05,059
understand to cover 20 percent so

406
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,090
I hope you can see it

407
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,690
decently I am not enlarged that it is

408
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,670
possible however we still

409
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,210
have perfect confirmation the public of

410
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,180
course as well as in

411
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,240
informed mind  to be able to sift through

412
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,290
more calmly and these are the bars the

413
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,360
activities that usually seo when I'm in

414
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,210
a hurry a very quick check on

415
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,510
something

416
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,419
attention to the concept of car very

417
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:41,660
often it is known that those who make offensive security develop forward

418
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,210


419
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,130
use this abbreviation

420
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,090
incorrectly because it is  out can mean both

421
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,380
authentication and authorization are

422
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,440
two very very different concepts not  it is

423
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,660
said that an authenticated user has the

424
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,669
right to see everything there is

425
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:01,309
on his site only an application

426
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,500
designed only for the user in rodi

427
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,330
user editor standard user

428
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,490
let's say so do believe when you

429
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,669
re-read the code at the

430
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:19,700
authorization concert do not do not trust  of

431
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,100
myrrh authentic star

432
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,869
to look for so this case would be

433
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:28,320
an authentic show by pass what I am going to

434
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,509
look at just look at the login forms

435
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:32,380


436
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,830
the force just log in I look very

437
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,430
trivially as the quotient did

438
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,310
only sequel but very often you

439
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:46,540
go to authenticate on su  rats see

440
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,520
others maybe as on other markets they

441
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,260
are not exactly sequels even in these cases it

442
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:56,050
is possible to do queer and therefore

443
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,670
make sure that the return of which is always true

444
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,330
a return and useful data for attacking

445
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,630
one thing that is often underestimated is

446
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,120
predictability  of cookies now that

447
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,670
modern frameworks are based on the

448
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,930
generation of the suppression of

449
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,490
the same or language  therefore

450
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,150
it is rare but it is not

451
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,640
impossible as always pay attention to

452
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,080
this thing it happened as I said

453
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,970
before checking an application with

454
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,340
many and even different back ends and there are

455
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,350
funny cases four the first dear fails

456
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,030
occurs when the user has not found

457
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,220
in the first  berkani been a lot of management

458
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,130
even if you developed the logic

459
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:48,460
behind the mccann gold switch they

460
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,650


461
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,670
are the talking remind me and the

462
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,870
password reset tokens

463
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,240
not all obviously the applications but it

464
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,510
is very frequent that there are problems

465
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,980
on these touch

466
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,360
the

467
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,510
distraction and

468
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,260
the mind never verified it happens  often to

469
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,700
find the problems and on the

470
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,370
registration part problems intended as

471
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,140
a bad choice of the user name

472
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,580
so I can go out in the user that

473
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,080
maybe they have aroused important for

474
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,140
the application or I can have the

475
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,540
possibility to assign me an

476
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,860
arbitrary gold here I decide with and it will be

477
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,059
an application

478
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,499
from this point on can

479
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:41,080
verify what are the interactions between

480
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,350
the ute  nti whether to really verify

481
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,110
the authorization to do activities

482
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,519
if the forms accept data fields that

483
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,580
are not explicit because maybe weapons can

484
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,610
send them the users no but the application

485
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,499
checks if who is sending them to the user

486
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:03,249
or the file management very very very

487
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:06,789
important that they are often s1

488
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:08,769
so when I load a

489
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:10,389
milic file this file is

490
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,600
checked then I check

491
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,369
the application check on the file and it

492
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,289
meets the requirements or not it is

493
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:19,480
accused at a point if that point is

494
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,779
predictable and unfortunately for us august

495
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:24,700
our luck or  bad luck of the

496
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,730
developer is also web sponsor will be

497
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,789
able to exploit that second in

498
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:34,389
which exposed to execute

499
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:37,570
arbitrary code lalo of files where perhaps

500
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,999
many times the valid extensions are

501
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:42,580
blacklisted and maybe do not well or they

502
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,190
are the database and the editable ones

503
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,440
media follows injection

504
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,740
and interactions with the operational stands

505
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,430
very often we find roulette is

506
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,260
dry you

507
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,830
don't care either  interactions with

508
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,030
third-party libraries

509
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,390
the more than 1300 quotes are those

510
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,880
that interact the one from besa

511
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,080
we could call them now not even

512
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,950
simply classes decline or the

513
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,710
libraries that make impressions very often in crisis

514
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,220
is fine but if done at

515
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,169
home you can find several problems

516
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:26,359
I ran  a little bit to do this he

517
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,090
doesn't have mica then you can look at it with

518
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,809
canon envelope I

519
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,140
'm here at the same time I make

520
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,510
two examples of real cases very fast and

521
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,220
we propose will ask

522
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,230
in the evening simmer

523
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,700
small chained try on

524
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,140
applications of which I have done

525
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,560
could

526
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,120
pretend to have a page  ad

527
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,310
minoli that is not wrapped that

528
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,410
the user cannot be seen to those who are exposed

529
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,930
but not for whom the authorization is not verified

530
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,470


531
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,740
c

532
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,720
an error when we are small let's say it finds a

533
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,000
safe unauthenticated injection that does

534
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,470
not allow me to do the pastel bahia

535
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,910
game so I can't log in as

536
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,679
admin on the application but I can

537
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,659
download the database,

538
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:21,239
let's see  o what can I do on the Danish my

539
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:23,369
name is context application

540
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:25,919
to the crash algorithm a custom

541
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,359
also in this case we are interested in it is

542
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,539
right that it is custom because

543
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:33,119
the application needs to decrypt the

544
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:35,759
data and therefore if it were even safer

545
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,470
in the world  however it must decrypt so

546
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,019
having source code in hand I can

547
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:43,139
also decrypt those data if if the

548
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:45,899
key is one

549
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:49,659
and by concatenating these three little cooler

550
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:52,539
skills what can I do step from

551
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:55,210
birthday they decrypt everything

552
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,119
I find in the application

553
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,619
the application number said is

554
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:02,349
a '  application that would take care of

555
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:04,529
connecting network devices to

556
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,749
carry out operations that break

557
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:09,669
long databases that are of which I have

558
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,940
managed to act as a pole

559
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,539
I can access from the target king on the

560
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,879
network by concatenating things precisely

561
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:19,080
in the ability a little peak of the rest

562
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,769
do a  very widespread damage on the network

563
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:24,379
another example of real life is

564
00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:26,370
an application that

565
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,950
I have the Umbrian users so

566
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,820
we can d  ire that, moreover, it is a century

567
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,149
calais so

568
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,800
far so good the problem is

569
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,510
that all the back ends are bought

570
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,740
was yes that it does not find a user who

571
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,190
drives

572
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,659
the new I try a security that is not

573
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,850
authenticated

574
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,549
the app centuries the database the

575
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:54,510
sequel driver allows me  to make

576
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,200
chained some boxwood they

577
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,720
used to say said in the evening to

578
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,509
insert

579
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:07,419
intent admin in the local

580
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:12,369
tents to the privileges

581
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:14,830
also in this case a small

582
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,659
chained can give me a year a

583
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:19,740
little bigger

584
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:23,230
as I said before theoretically the

585
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,020
mind map should have visited

586
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,240
reach  the famous many 300 in 20

587
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,450
minutes and obviously something or is lost

588
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,850
along the way because even with 20

589
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,419
% of the time like everything and keep in

590
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:40,350
mind that it is

591
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,180
nothing that not 20% will take

592
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,810
away much more than the 80 minutes we go

593
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,350
we left  aside attention

594
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,150
this which explained in a

595
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,360
professional method is a method for running and therefore

596
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,010
achieves a somewhat

597
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,980
appreciable goal  do not get carried away

598
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,950
and trustworthy and sells canvas with the method

599
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,170
to make you run as much as you can

600
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,070
you want to have fun a

601
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,890
few nights a week ok if

602
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,060
you have to do it for a living

603
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,210
mom goes very wide

604
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:17,970
and initially told me this kind

605
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,450
of activity they

606
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,289
are very very piriche and yes  based

607
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:29,260
on practice on on on practice

608
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,360
I do not believe that perfection exists

609
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,220
above all in a world like this

610
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,400
of the cyber security of the security

611
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,990
of formats for data formations

612
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,710
and the practice that study the comparison

613
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,990
as it is done precisely that on it is

614
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,810
close to  perfection but it is impossible to

615
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,530
reach perfection it

616
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:57,500
went well well then thanks to

617
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,660
totti's goals but slide with the questions but we are

618
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,130
the super hyper I said so the questions

619
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:07,500
we send them back to the group telegram for 15

620
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,650
seconds

621
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,240
we ran we did twenty minutes

622
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,090
what would probably be a

623
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:17,700
not even a long tone but workshop i

624
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,410
wouldn't mind if you succeed if you

625
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,960
enjoyed this ride propose for

626
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,370
next year something a little

627
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,680
more structured where we talk even if

628
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,820
I can you see in this slide

629
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:34,200
obviously thanks due to the

630
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,889
staff of s
