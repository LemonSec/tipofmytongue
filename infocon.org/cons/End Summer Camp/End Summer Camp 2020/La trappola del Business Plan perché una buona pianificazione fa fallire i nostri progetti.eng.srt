1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
so if they speak to you, thank

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,759
sebastian it's so much thanks for the invitation to

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,580
point I actually feel a bit of a

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,400
UFO in this context but I must say

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,570
that recently we cannot

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,670
say we can dedicate ourselves to business issues

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,189
of consulting on

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,279
corporate organizations without addressing  the themes that

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,480
you have the programs I have looked at them,

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,300
not designs, but everything is getting a little

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,849
more mixed in the writing

12
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,140
that book after having written another

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,570
book dear maker and who was investigating having

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,180
made the rounds of all the fab labs in the

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,739
area to try to  understand

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,590
how the world of makers works how much it

17
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,980
was a great media construction that

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,020
then did not have much behind it I

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,059
confirmed that it was so I wrote it

20
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,329
I got hated by a bit of

21
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:52,289
the field and then I passed another

22
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,420
topic for which  I was also the pact

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,829
in the

24
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,309
baker fab lab world and among other things if we

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,680
are black but we are in a pub because

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,979
this year's edition we did

27
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,110
support  ndosi at a structure is and

28
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,720
stretches in san donà and not going to

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,430
build like every year in the field with

30
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,740
tents all that this entailed

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,000
in the last desire to

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,159
actually physically come to see the

33
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,520
sculptures of the leader park and in the next few

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:28,470
weeks a jump I do  but the thing

35
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,810
it says i wish that writing books that

36
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,869
criticize some aspect is

37
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:34,470
the best way

38
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,090
then it causes everyone to hurt to talk about the

39
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,040
topic there so i think

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,229
after writing that yes fab lab i saw

41
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,270
all fable they called me  to understand how to get

42
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,520
organized and how to change from

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,140
their own writing on

44
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,729
the business plan trap everyone asked me

45
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,649
to write a business plan with them and

46
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,229
therefore I don't know if it is a way the

47
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,729
marketing strategy lowered the book on the

48
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:58,170
stature of the business plan actually does

49
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,299
little  I present it all through a

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,009
few slides that I have prepared to give

51
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,909
me an order it was born not as my

52
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,068
thought came out of a

53
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:11,469
bottle of  wine and more but for the

54
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:13,840
fact that the criticism of the business plan at

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,389
a certain stage of the development of an idea

56
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:20,139
of a physical digital service product,

57
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:23,230
anything else is very widespread and was born

58
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,389
in the world of California software

59
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:27,939
and goes very well with all  the

60
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,099
themes of the start-ups of the already il and

61
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,079
of other innovation frameworks

62
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:35,560
that is the theme is in an initial phase in

63
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,689
which I still do not even know if there will be

64
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:39,280
someone and will buy what I am

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,650
building go and make a

66
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,469
prospective financial plan

67
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,359
updated to the  interest rate with

68
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:48,609
all the ketty graphs and other things maybe

69
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:50,620
premature maybe it makes me spend so

70
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,659
much time building something

71
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,609
detailed there in financial

72
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:57,010
financial terms that I could even lighten

73
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,500
that part at the beginning instead devote myself

74
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,599
a little to saying the essential things they

75
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,849
want  also demonstrate the investor

76
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:07,299
that hoskin in game that I am inside the

77
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:09,519
piece there and that I know how to move in those

78
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,040
contexts in which I want to do something and

79
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,259
know how to  to use excel great and

80
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,849
perhaps a great demonstration of knowing how to

81
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:16,659
use excel

82
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:18,280
but it does not tell me much about the

83
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,049
probability that my track works

84
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:22,739
in there was already this the

85
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,169
california pins with the ban on business

86
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:29,379
plan that was carried in the various states 3

87
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,509
rounds for the  various events

88
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:34,000
I have tried to report this

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,159
movement has a somewhat more

90
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,310
structured thought that says ok let's see why

91
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,780
the business plan or in any case the

92
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,230
detailed planning

93
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,879
is not that it is wrong to

94
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,739
know how to do it but perhaps a certain

95
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,230
novara phase after which we understand that

96
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,150
alternatives  I am and that we also have this what it

97
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,159
means in terms of

98
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,400
how one or someone who wants to carry

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,769
out an innovation is organized trying to

100
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,069
follow these others and the framework for

101
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:04,290
all this so a big book was born

102
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,519
played various experiences I try now to

103
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,140
accompany you in the story afterwards  of which is

104
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,090
at any time ie you are if you

105
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,579
see any questions they write and the asl

106
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:17,370
at the supply it  on ask me and

107
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,430
now gone back ek retractable of

108
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,030
with videos with great skill let's see

109
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,740
if I make my screen

110
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,930
representation here where you should

111
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,840
see a presentation right now

112
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,210
and confirm me down we see

113
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,090
as usual but

114
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,160
we see it full screen perfect

115
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,020
perfect  yes I had opened it the

116
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,380
message sent subtitle

117
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,419
because good planning makes

118
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,130
our projects fail because not only is it

119
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,949
premature but there is something wrong with

120
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:55,440
doing good planning when I have

121
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,110
an idea told me to present what

122
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,510
I do  I am a former manager in

123
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,300
the field of design and furniture design and then

124
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,800
consultant on innovation on

125
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,620
models for innovation of products

126
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,389
and services for various companies from

127
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:14,940
the largest to the smallest and by doing

128
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,389
this I deal with everything I meet

129
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:20,190
innovative companies other so I

130
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,169
can occasionally  putting together a post of

131
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:23,639
interesting things I like to write

132
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,280
so this thing also led to

133
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,830
these books said qu  I am on the other hand papa to

134
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,830
tell all those who listen is the

135
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,210
starting point a starting point

136
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,130
that was touch that deals a lot with

137
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,760
technology

138
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,740
here I also enjoyed these

139
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,750
drawings that you will see slides are

140
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,850
the result of my lockdown because not

141
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,830
having  interrupted for a few

142
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,270
weeks a lot of the

143
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,190
consultancy work put to draw

144
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,590
with the penalty in the trad attics

145
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,450
so this is the first goal scored

146
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,910
so so is the drone that

147
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,620
kind of fake inside nor of the delivery

148
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,979
of the amazon package at 2 km of  distance

149
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:00,660
in the customer field but he wanted to explain

150
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,940
that there is a new logistics the year

151
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,550
designed because we are actually in

152
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,289
a moment of seeing a story about

153
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:11,370
innovation beyond the

154
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,340
pandemic or other that is busy is

155
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,490
of business companies and denis technology

156
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,800
there is a very strong rhetoric about the

157
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,099
many possibilities that

158
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,660
technology gives hi to pay

159
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,500
only it is always that pc nanny the

160
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,000
visible one that delivered here the  drones are the

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,460
first Canadian city a series of packages

162
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,530
and flying there is not so much the fact that if

163
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,539
you go to see it fake the rest everyone

164
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,430
but that many believed in it

165
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,039
obviously there is a project

166
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:41,789
actually underway for an

167
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:44,400
amazon flying warehouse it is obvious  which has a little bit

168
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,219
of what security and what

169
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:48,330
else is red than technological

170
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,150
but the theme is they believed us many believed us we

171
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,050
are

172
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,520
all at a time when

173
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,430
we think it is possible to do a lot

174
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,009
with technology in reality one thing

175
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:00,330
what amazon did was really

176
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,060
effective they begin to sell the

177
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,550
locks to let people know that is

178
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,139
the block of the last moment of

179
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,729
delivery in which you do not know where to

180
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,500
put them all they have

181
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,740
the office delivered by keeping it if purified puts

182
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,960
a camera inside I send  the

183
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,259
car code destroys itself consignee

184
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,509
I follow it cameras opens the door puts

185
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,250
down the package close to the north it

186
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,610
destroys the 5 star codes and we are

187
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,750
all contained  it

188
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,110
is obvious to you that there are stories of

189
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,430
technologies that work or work

190
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,069
there are some we had retriti that is

191
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:37,349
that image of the students who

192
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:38,789
had these things in mind

193
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:42,180
were actually aimed at saying and making the

194
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,069
teacher say it passed by the teacher about the

195
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:46,979
students they were attentive  they weren't

196
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:47,879
tired

197
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,259
let's say that if we didn't put this

198
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,810
terrifying thing on the head it was

199
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,400
also a good idea to interrupt the

200
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,620
lesson when you have all the students

201
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,750
falling asleep the

202
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,370
interesting thing is that in the mind the

203
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,340
technology seems to allow everything

204
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,979
obviously as usual yes  unleash me

205
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,630
or wire and take care of it

206
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,819
there are those who already have the logo is

207
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,650
a link what is called that of hamas i

208
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,000
am talking about put it in the head

209
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,210
immediately after the pig that until now and

210
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,889
there are those who think that this

211
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:22,139
will lead to the end of the  the singular that

212
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,870
I have other things from the end of the world

213
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,509
millenarians and it is obviously part of the

214
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:30,029
history of the place to have  a

215
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:31,650
reaction of this type in the face

216
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,849
of innovation

217
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:34,260
but I wanted to bring this call

218
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,208
of innovation to say

219
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,159
if on the one hand we begin to have

220
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,279
the idea that we can do everything that

221
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,958
even what I have seen before now

222
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,670
I have not followed but I think  that many of

223
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,069
your shots of today we have

224
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:50,490
told interesting things in

225
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,490
revolutionary perspective that will change

226
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,829
the way we work we relate

227
00:08:55,829 --> 00:09:00,480
here study the theme of

228
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,300
potential is also linked to a kind

229
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,149
of rhetoric I said there is an area that

230
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:08,429
says we can do  of everything I who

231
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:09,569
deal more with business

232
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:11,490
the organization of the company changes

233
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,160
radically the supply chain has also

234
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,769
thanks to the renewed logistics

235
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:19,589
the services and products are changed between lots

236
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:24,029
of intelligence and more to choose me

237
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,129
other can be really

238
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:28,470
changed all the ways I saw the

239
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,779
controversy these days and about that

240
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,929
digital pregnancy test that is

241
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:36,749
doing that to this chip that has the

242
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:39,149
same calculation capacity that  had the

243
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:43,079
first pc of ibm in 81 and there is a chip

244
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,569
inside a pregnancy test that is

245
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:47,879
analog but which was actually put

246
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,410
there because it allows you to

247
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,199
immediately give written feedback on

248
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:55,529
whether the person is pregnant or not

249
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,199
because  I mention it because in reality

250
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:59,100
the intelligence of that innovation

251
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,220
was putting a digital technology

252
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,189
inside an analog element not because it

253
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:09,660
changes the way in which the

254
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,839
pregnant woman is detected but because 71 percent

255
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,920
of these measurements were correct

256
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,009
but 29 percent  one hundred of those who did a

257
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:23,459
pregnancy test especially in a

258
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,410
third world country could not interpret the

259
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,990
result and therefore 29 300 heads goes wrong

260
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,879
what was the technology in there

261
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,100
has touched that moment of the

262
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,100
path of adopting a service that

263
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,889
was the problem that was  the moment in

264
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:40,170
which the value of the service was lost

265
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,439
those in reality also the whole story

266
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:45,540
of this new revolution for that

267
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,780
digital

268
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,430
to somehow hack the world

269
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,860
physical to go and give a

270
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,920
new service but really to touch everything goes

271
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,630
to touch marketing too

272
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,400
obviously but strangely touch the way in which

273
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,590


274
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,080
organizations collaborate internally and in many other areas

275
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,700
we do not talk about an industry just

276
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,680
zero point because those who deal with it  of companies more

277
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,390
to hear about but it is

278
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,890
evident that in here that the other

279
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,230
was not even artificial intelligence and

280
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,390
half

281
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,800
the initial version that had

282
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,020
made its time just to say how much

283
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,510
things change then opportunities

284
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,450
in front of incredible all right  all

285
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,800
a good story

286
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,650
something does not add up in reality I have taken

287
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,070
some data partner says that

288
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,110
the largest companies in the world go to study

289
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,580
eighty percent of projects

290
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,560
in the digital field do not work on the

291
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,810
market do not work in the sense that I have

292
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,730
kept them there  in my fan

293
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,290
of innovation with all the possible

294
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,270
projects but they just arrive on the market

295
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,510
and if they passed me all the internships  in

296
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,150
gates that bring product to the

297
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,910
end customer and 80

298
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,590
per cent of

299
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,230
the late clayton christensen do not work there but

300
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,080
also in the ul he says that 72 per cent of the

301
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,780
products introduced in the last five

302
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,580
years have failed to achieve their

303
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,590
set revenue or

304
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,290
income targets or  you have failed completely has

305
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,600
recently added these two or

306
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,580
data that were located in the free his

307
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,050
read this beautiful the beautiful book that I

308
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,660
recommend to everyone for I do 23 23 and

309
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,390
quotes from the ideas of the big ben arfa the

310
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,780
hidden half that tells that 90

311
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,150
percent  of

312
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,649
peer-reviewed

313
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,470
scientific results that we would expect also

314
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,589
some credibility that have been

315
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,509
published in the

316
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:39,939
world's leading journals that have been made of

317
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:41,800
the world's major portals was

318
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,389
not replicable once

319
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,579
someone attempted to do so 90 percent

320
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:45,999


321
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,920
the lawsuits are very well written in the

322
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,980
book but there is something about the death

323
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,449
c on the fact that in reality tant  and of the

324
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:54,339
things we do do not reach the

325
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,619
final result even when he has

326
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,089
passed everything that the great

327
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,429
companies put in place to

328
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:01,900
manage innovation

329
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,300
the question is because he had put a

330
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,910
little bit in the presentation of my

331
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,370
intervention because there is a

332
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,760
such a high failure rate in our

333
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,940
projects occurs not only at the level of

334
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,290
very large companies but at the level of

335
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,770
small companies of small innovators

336
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,080
also of freelancers and the idea

337
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,030
that you want to bring does not

338
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,460
succeed in the end and the data continues to

339
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,470
be  data of this type are so

340
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,510
disheartening there is someone who would also like

341
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,340
to say why we think about it so much

342
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,970
let's try because how to roll the dice

343
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,740
is a bit of building luck after

344
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,050
ideas we roll it let's see what happens in

345
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,420
reality

346
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,400
this is not even the answer

347
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,339
because

348
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,620
in the search for the causes why

349
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,939
most innovation projects

350
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:51,110
fail,

351
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,629
discard some do not take the one that

352
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:56,209
says that  internal professionals auction

353
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,129
in the company those who participate and

354
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,319
worked with here are the companies

355
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:02,870
participate in the esc as well someone who

356
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,579
works in large

357
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:07,250
organizations does not have the skills

358
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,980
are not adequate to the challenge this does not

359
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,199
work because these same

360
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:15,319
failure rates are found in  italy as in

361
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:17,269
california but berlin as in tel aviv

362
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:20,000
like me in more than one places in japan or

363
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,680
other parts there is just a

364
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,290
characteristic of the organizations

365
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,180
that anci innovation that brings a

366
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,610
failure rate and is independent of

367
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,490
the peculiar situation of the

368
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,579
the skills of the subjects with whom

369
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:36,610
companies collaborate is not

370
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,019
even access to technological know-how

371
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,709
as demonstrated by the event itself in the East

372
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,509
and many other initiatives but also

373
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,949
many places where you can

374
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:47,449
go to retrieve information

375
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:50,180
I think never like today in  house is

376
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,189
reachable rather there is a problem

377
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:54,410
today of having the ability to connect

378
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,689
points them av  we will know that to the

379
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,790
information how to get there quickly

380
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,980
many of our of our

381
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,180
organizations that there is this every

382
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,670
day have extraordinary

383
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,870
technical skills closed in the

384
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,180
technical offices in the closed style offices

385
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,920
there in front of a coffee in front of

386
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,870
some design tool they do not

387
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,339
speak  with no one at the heart of the

388
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:16,220
company there is a theme of relationships but

389
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,800
the theme of access

390
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,019
to information today is really much

391
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,300
simpler than what it could have been a

392
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,980
few years ago, so the

393
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,019
difficulty of accessing know-how is no less difficult

394
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:29,480
technology such as the question that we

395
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,519
can ask ourselves what is the problem for

396
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,980
which there is this right

397
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,069
failure rate and we get them close to the theme

398
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,790
of the book I wrote because the

399
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,860
problem is here

400
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,150
what has therefore begun to see

401
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,980
that a little bit ahead of the  'app dauni

402
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,840
designs it was much better this

403
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,900
here is a ford model t that I was

404
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,330
lucky enough to even get on it before the op

405
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,740
dauno it seemed to me  a bit of trips

406
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,290
to japan from toyota to see

407
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,640


408
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,160
the ford and the scissor in detroit a nice museum that i

409
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,630
recommend to everyone when you can

410
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,790
travel again where you go to

411
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,500
see a lot of things in the history

412
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,890
of

413
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,470
not only the cars of the  mobility

414
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,720
but also of technology in general there is

415
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,440
a very famous ford model t that knowledge

416
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,950
that ford is a bit like some others are

417
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,540
always cited for all the posts of

418
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,030
everything so ford is that if I had

419
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,100
asked my customers what they wanted they

420
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,990
would have told me  horses faster and

421
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,470
therefore enjoys the innovation of the

422
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,120
designer who manages to think

423
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,160
outside the market but it is also what

424
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,080
is mentioned paper mills my customers

425
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,300
can take a strong of any

426
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,520
color as long as black because then what he

427
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,950
has transformed into the assembly line

428
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,500
in the  standardization and economies

429
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,980
of scale and the economy of cars motivates

430
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,900
the management that the management

431
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,790
of innovation the management of the

432
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,670
path with which I bring new  learned and

433
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,310
new services to the market was born in the

434
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,320
years in which these large

435
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,210
automotive companies were formed at the beginning of the

436
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,810
twentieth century by ford always suited as

437
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,730
a reference point to understand in mind

438
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,970
the circles in the assembly lines

439
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,839
easily who made an

440
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,069
even stronger contribution this  halfreddson not

441
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,010
what the general motors character

442
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,819
that has brought the maximum result is the

443
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,220
ability to grow through

444
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,890
economies of scale I produce more who

445
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,480
produces more pays off

446
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,420
the investment better many pieces the various

447
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,310
systems that I have set up of videos

448
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,620
I know that  I do not know that I have in front of

449
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,150
dear dino things that are quite trivial from

450
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,350
an economic point of view

451
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,680
every now and then maybe etc. this famous

452
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,020
matrix called washing machine of the

453
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,870
boston consulting group bcg that told

454
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,190
how to manage a portfolio of

455
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,100
innovations to one part you had was the

456
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,710
thing for  which I am quoting

457
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,980
on the one hand I had the growth rate

458
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,950
of the market which said if it was interesting to

459
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,080
have  a product on that market argues

460
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,210
to be a product within

461
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,210
the aerospace space it would not be

462
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,220
bad to be able to follow the rules of

463
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,190
slow star spaces and so on

464
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,409
because there is a growth rate of the market

465
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:16,750
dash from the other parts to bar

466
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,789
market difficulties and in there then

467
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:21,760
if you are not criminally mask 6 on the

468
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,679
upper part if you are someone you are trying now to

469
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,750
approach some Italian companies

470
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,000
that I have met recently if on

471
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,460
the right side it is a function of

472
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,559
market shares and growth rate plus you

473
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,059
manage them all  your innovations

474
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:37,940
the interesting thing, however, is that having

475
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,299
put the market share into success on the

476
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:43,490
market tells you that it is less

477
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,120
in an area where you produce the more you

478
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,610
amortize your investments you make a

479
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,100
margin and the more you reinvest this margin

480
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,110
build further plants that is the

481
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,480
technologies  what kind of market you had

482
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,100
when you had these economies of scale

483
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,690
when you had the automobile market

484
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,690
in the early years and it is  the first half of the

485
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,549
century up i think many of you

486
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:10,669
will have seen mad men with various various

487
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:12,679
adventures of these

488
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,289
60s marketing personalities in the

489
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:18,619
united states on madison avenue the for a certain

490
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:21,769
period of a sector of a business of

491
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,590
a technology really wins who

492
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,509
produces more because there is a

493
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:28,639
receptive market market buys a

494
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,299
very high demand you produce that produces more

495
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:33,470
amortizes investments that are more or

496
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,330
less the same for everyone lowers the price

497
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,119
because or uses and margins to produce

498
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,309
even more and conquers

499
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:41,809
market share  and it is for this reason that at that time

500
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:46,249
and in the 50 63 years 70 that had more

501
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:50,119
market power that had more space and

502
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,999
more market share managed to produce

503
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:55,730
more innovation something happened

504
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,149
after it happened that all this

505
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:01,820
the city of winning by growing into

506
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,549
more damage than the others is a bit skipped in

507
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:06,289
many cases because supply and demand

508
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,450
have reversed then at a certain point

509
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,679
you found that you had to

510
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,440
differ  en to make more quality you have

511
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,210
to be able to make faster response times

512
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,639
design something custom

513
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:18,710
given for the customer to be able to be

514
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,529
very dynamic very able to

515
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:23,690
change the way in which to approach the

516
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,029
market every day it is no coincidence that

517
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:28,429
in recent years  many models

518
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:30,519
on innovation have moved

519
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:34,849
towards agility lean startup

520
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:36,049
already has management

521
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:38,479
there is an ability to change every day

522
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:41,539
because your relationship with the market has

523
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:43,369
changed supply is greater than

524
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:45,200
demand and therefore must  in some dead

525
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,409
way differentiating from others is the

526
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:52,290
realm in which this management that

527
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,990
was oriented to a

528
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,450
perfect execution process in the face of a

529
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,340
predetermined result, i.e. to

530
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,290
make that machine always the same as much as possible,

531
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,720
uncertainty was blown up and

532
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,500
complexity became the center of the  those who work

533
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,920
in the market

534
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,890
while first all that

535
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,800
interested me was to have a well-

536
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,290
defined plan immediately, possibly in

537
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,820
many years ahead  i with a nice business

538
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,340
plan with a gantt chart and with

539
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,400
all the times well defined costs and

540
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,070
anything else after which this was

541
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,890
just a question of execution

542
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,240
execution who was better

543
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,880
able to execute things according to plan managed to win

544
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,640
on the market then  if you shift everything to

545
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,290
actually executing the

546
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,090
extraordinary business plan because at

547
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,000
that point you have a plan and a common point of

548
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,530
reference in which all your

549
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,630
organization and collaborators

550
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,490
other people who work with you are

551
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,990
oriented to do I have to do exactly

552
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,180
that  o result to be achieved is

553
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,750
set

554
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,280
I cannot change there is no uncertainty

555
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,020
there is no complexity come

556
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,050
back to interesting another person

557
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,630
who is actually connected to general

558
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,610
motors but no one knows that william

559
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,190
durant belle durant who is the one who

560
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,620
founded general motors  he is the one

561
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,510
who actually did not have great

562
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,480
managerial skills but he is the one who had the

563
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,760
ideas the ideas of innovation as often

564
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,010
av  it comes in the visionaries who launch the

565
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,910
visionary innovations there are knowing

566
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,220
themselves and not mask steve jobs another

567
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,840
people who maybe in the past but also

568
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,500
not very popular given the type of profile

569
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,910
is the one that came out but in reality

570
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,520
that type of approach is

571
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,250
someone's approach  that questions

572
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,350
what is in front of him is very critical or

573
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,720
lateral thinking a thought that tries

574
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,490
to get out of the common logic is not the

575
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,490
thought of those who instead focus

576
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,290
on the manageriality that is needed for

577
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,750
a precise repetitive execution of

578
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,670
tasks that are always the same because the

579
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,710
founder  of the earth once I am kicked

580
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,290
out of the board of directors he sunk

581
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,840
chevrolet goes then he also had

582
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,070
further difficulties sonate seeing you

583
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,350
his life is very interesting and demonstrates

584
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,330
how the initial visionary in a

585
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,700
path the life cycle of a new

586
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,320
Aryan technology produced a new

587
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,420
company  usually the one who

588
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,990
brings in the majority of the market

589
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,790
his product is never someone who succeeds  to

590
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,940
make people fall in love with a vision and make

591
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,980
his clients become accomplices

592
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,750
who accompany

593
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,180
him because he is a visionary and then

594
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,210
I buy the first iphone that came out

595
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,890
even if left-handed I couldn't make

596
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,080
phone calls because it is not important that

597
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,090
that thing is there  knows it is good it is

598
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,720
important to belong to that sodium and

599
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,760
the innovators let us castrate

600
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,820
this by william durant they are people

601
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,830
who drag you people who do not

602
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:52,650
follow the pace of those who instead must make it

603
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:57,360
become standardized and centered

604
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,950
on execution is based on

605
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,690
careful planning to the business

606
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,610
so we are saying that an

607
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,710
initial phase of any

608
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,090
innovation requires more people similar to another

609
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,360
because because in the initial uncertainty it is

610
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,830
the moment of uncertainty and what

611
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,260
characterizes all the new moments

612
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,580
of a market

613
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,600
we are in very strange conditions and to

614
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,610
do  an example I cite two three things that

615
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,850
strip a little of the contents of the

616
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,070
nuts that I mentioned earlier but they are very

617
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,510
in  interesting at his second outing at

618
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,460
sea workshop are the shrimp species

619
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,429
that are very famous because for

620
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:38,820
some years now there has been europe

621
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,970
raised in germany 10 or maybe even

622
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:42,470
earlier

623
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,350
they have a characteristic they self clone

624
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,870
there are no two genera are  of the

625
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,650
animals are the shrimps of the shrimps that

626
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,480
manage to reproduce and exactly

627
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,760
repeating the same genes for

628
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,980
cloning flute cloning and have

629
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,990
been on the side of an animal of

630
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,720
great success because it will

631
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,760
still be looking on the internet for articles about

632
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,400
its distribution in Europe and that it is

633
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,140
growing more and more but on the other hand

634
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,540
they were the boon for researchers

635
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,690
because having an animal that

636
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,090
produces those same genes but that I

637
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,340
can control hy laboratory could

638
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,330
allow to face the theme of

639
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,160
eternal doubt whether nature is more important

640
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,370
to evolution or  the life you have

641
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,100
that is how it is born hygienic and the

642
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,250
genetic inheritance you have or if your education is

643
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,110
what happens to you in the  life all the

644
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,640
phenomena that happen to you in life are

645
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,650
more important what makes us what

646
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,070
we are plus the genes we have

647
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,510
everything we inherited from the past

648
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,340
and characteristics that made us

649
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,440
tall in a certain way than if they did

650
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,080
smart  a certain mario biondi morio

651
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,210
other or what finally happens to us

652
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,059
you could put all

653
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:00,590
these shrimps inside a box

654
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,090
illuminate them in the same way feed them

655
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,070
exactly the same way and then

656
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,160
since nature was identical because

657
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,770
the genes were exactly the same

658
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,840
what had brought them  to make a

659
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,030
week of life it was exactly the

660
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,150
same thing finally I could understand

661
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,309
some prawns had to come and after a

662
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:22,020
few days some exactly

663
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,150
identical prawns and then finally we could

664
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,850
put under control these

665
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,809
growth phenomena between genetics and

666
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:33,870
norcia what happened is the

667
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,059
next photo  for a week the shrimps

668
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,830
have grown in this way

669
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,429
as you see the thing and nature is the same

670
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:43,649
life teeth corpse same food same

671
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:46,019
lamp same thing are born leggings

672
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:47,220
that have evolved but different race

673
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,019
now each of us can think of a

674
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:51,899
thousand reasons 1 the first who arrived

675
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:52,649
at food took a

676
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:55,139
competitive advantage that all the others had

677
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:57,210
however, the directional light in the

678
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,429
box was a certain way we can think

679
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:01,049
that the laboratory had never put

680
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:02,940
everything under control as much as possible and

681
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,440
failed to keep all

682
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,240
the variables of the case under control is an

683
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,619
interesting example to say that there is that

684
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:10,049
hidden beta of phenomena  that affects

685
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:10,950
what we will do

686
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,210
and everything that we think we

687
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,879
plan in reality the idea we have

688
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:17,970
is not transferable neither in time and there

689
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,009
are many examples on these nor in

690
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:21,539
space if man from geography to

691
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,389
another the same project can  fail

692
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:28,279
miserably there are many cases of

693
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,149
models of and social innovation

694
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,889
made in india that takes them to the

695
00:27:31,889 --> 00:27:34,200
philippines completely fail there

696
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,389
are  innovations that in the small

697
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:38,399
work very well and as soon as the stairs

698
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,539
jumps everything

699
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,919
but not even in the dimension in time

700
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,499
not even in the space intended as when

701
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:49,470
I repeat the same innovation and other

702
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,330
times half of the phenomena can happen

703
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,159
and hidden I cannot

704
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,240
control

705
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,009
it I am able to  putting under control and

706
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,840
therefore a planning such as a

707
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,480
business plan in a certain phase

708
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,740
of innovation risks being only

709
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,389
the demonstration of being able to

710
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:05,730
give a good cinema for the banks for

711
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,330
investors

712
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,610
currently gives me the idea that one that

713
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,590
apple is proposing  to some idea of

714
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,360
what it means is an income statement the

715
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,529
balance sheet

716
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:16,259
perhaps the cash flows launch but giulia

717
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,999
demonstrations of competence

718
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:20,129
if you go to fish many of the

719
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:22,019
business plans after a year review them

720
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:24,929
initial need almost always for a thousand

721
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:27,750
reasons not foreseeable initially

722
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,970
but in  where cinema begins the era

723
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,400
that we could foresee everything have

724
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,870
determined results  completely

725
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,530
different

726
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,710
then you are so rather than

727
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,930
wasting a lot of time doing these

728
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,320
things

729
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,850
obviously being able to do something

730
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,190
different another case maybe closer

731
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:44,490
to you

732
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,380
I don't know if still valid but I had read it

733
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,360
some time ago on a nice newsletter

734
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,890
gazzi mazar  it told a mechanism for

735
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,610
which they had

736
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,920
given some central expert lady

737
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,500
some photos of the kings of rome they had asked them they

738
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,360
will be male females they

739
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,250
took one of the experts and that a

740
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,750
little more detailed face that this photo

741
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,710
I took practically they guessed it

742
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,540
will be the mask  in that 50

743
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,250
percent correctness and being two

744
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,230
opportunities and obviously it means that

745
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,030
their answer was more or less random

746
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,420
they gave millions of photos give an

747
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,070
answer and with training

748
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,600
software machine learning mechanisms and

749
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,760
at a certain point they came to have some

750
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,160
results that more such if you understand

751
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,630
what but there they start you will succeed for

752
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,850
very well were correct with the 93 for

753
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,340
cen  but they could not black box in the

754
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,010
middle of neural networks and anything else I

755
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,350
could not exactly understand what kind

756
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,640
of reasoning what kind of correlation

757
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,410
the machine had found

758
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,570
yet 93 percent guessed in

759
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,880
short what tells me attention the

760
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,190
phenomenon of uncertainty are  even more

761
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,650
exasperated by the emergence the machine

762
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,169
learning of the official intelligence

763
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,350
more in excess is extended because I had

764
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,720
less deterministic control over the

765
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,910
phenomena and salerno more and more children of

766
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,730
a stochastic and statistical analysis of

767
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,220
the data and then yes we are in these

768
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,990
conditions a further

769
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,110
element for which we will trust

770
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,760
resume medicine in a computer tells us that it

771
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,559
works but we do not understand why it is

772
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,970
a whole series of ethical problems of

773
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,720
this type

774
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,570
beyond this we enter

775
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,740
further into an area of uncertainty

776
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,410
and complexity we enter what

777
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,900
really many  of you they know to be

778
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,059
a tale of barton to russell who

779
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:33,400
always told that rooster  na that

780
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,679
was based on past data in this

781
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,410
type every journalist her breeder

782
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,480
who brought her to eat every day

783
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,630
at the same time she had feed

784
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,340
ate she tells and had an idea

785
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,160
for quite a few days that the coach

786
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,390
was  a good person

787
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,580
the center one day arrives at the

788
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,770
breeder and casually christmas but she

789
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,870
did not know size remembers the hen

790
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,240
and takes her to lunch and therefore studying

791
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,270
100 houses that are always the same that is repeated in

792
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,140
the same way

793
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,029
obviously does not allow us

794
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,210
to have the ability to  think about

795
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,039
planning what will happen because

796
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,509
we cannot rely on

797
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:12,849
past knowledge the relationship cause

798
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:16,149
effect jumps and very often the business

799
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:19,210
plan planning in america is

800
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,710
based on the idea that we can

801
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,969
replicate our knowledge and accurately

802
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:27,009
and that we can rely on

803
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:29,469
knowledge  pass the complexity to

804
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:32,710
understand the one I use with younger students

805
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,019
but just to understand us when it

806
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:36,549
comes to compl  essity

807
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:38,080
the most important thing is that the

808
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,580
information is not available

809
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:39,999
immediately it

810
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:42,549
means that what

811
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:44,769
will happen is not predictable I do not have the task with

812
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,749
pierino who has the three apples that cost

813
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:49,179
this goes to the market and or the algorithm to be

814
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:51,429
applied is not a task  from algorithm

815
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:54,729
is a task in which I have to be careful to

816
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:56,379
incorporate new information that they had

817
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:58,869
progressively and therefore be careful

818
00:31:58,869 --> 00:32:00,249
and feedback is sifted through the

819
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:02,320
information to bring out new

820
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,609
knowledge compared to what at the

821
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:05,950
beginning is the most important thing and

822
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:09,580
therefore there is no  it is the ford model t

823
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,099
ready there all concentrated on doing

824
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,409
what is not there at the start and the departures

825
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:16,509
at the end do you know if any of you who is

826
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:19,479
makes an agile contract and says pd

827
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,580
pushed they will change things I have

828
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,080
seen a company a lot  important ex

829
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,659
found with a very important user

830
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:27,879
have decided to introduce the jive the

831
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,950
sprint has within their

832
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,320
product innovation procedures and they found themselves

833
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,089
with the contract for  rò in that

834
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:36,669
very important client he said if we use the

835
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:38,379
jive we make the exponents we change

836
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:40,089
every day but the contract we

837
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:41,559
sign it with penalties if we do not

838
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,789
reach exactly this

839
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:45,820
result he is moggi is there is on his

840
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,049
side of the company that has a power

841
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,599
is not  managed to blow up the thing

842
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,369
that is the third element of complexity

843
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,580
is important if I adapt to the idea

844
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,399
that I do not know where I will arrive I can

845
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,139
not even follow a notice me to do

846
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:00,279
once the names are also built

847
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,799
I was with a notice in a company in

848
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,659
I used to work cosca lago that a

849
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:07,629
design furniture company that I mentioned before the

850
00:33:07,629 --> 00:33:10,479
Paduan together with fiat must make a

851
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:12,909
tender for 200 thousand euros

852
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:15,879
kind that it made available to us I

853
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:19,090
remember that institution and that it had on the first

854
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,099
page that I remember to fill in it

855
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,570
had to have  two years to

856
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:26,460
study the future of the experience

857
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,539
of the driver and passengers in the automotive sector

858
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,700
and trying to take a cue

859
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,229
from all the design investigations is a

860
00:33:35,229 --> 00:33:37,330
thing  a visionary artistic well in which

861
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,159
you absolutely did not know in the world of

862
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:41,229
varela where no man has arrived before

863
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:43,599
we had to create this future

864
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:45,309
on the first page of the announcement describe

865
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:48,399
in detail the result you must

866
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,669
produce because there is a

867
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:54,429
cultural clash between those inside that world

868
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:56,200
the general motors of the ford of the

869
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,570
management that does not start to work I

870
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,580
am sure where he wants to arrive

871
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,590
who instead is aware of the complexity

872
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,259
that instead says I do not know where it will arrive I will get

873
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:08,199
there over time and there was a

874
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,569
weak average rate of the bridge at the nyt

875
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:14,799
there was more very high turnover rate

876
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:16,719
because every time people who

877
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,889
did not tell them why they are doing

878
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,480
this where we arrive they will answer

879
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,020
I still know it

880
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,389
is just a cultural attitude that

881
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:24,760
says work without knowing exactly

882
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,520
from the arrival rule and therefore we are

883
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,010
in the year linearity  between games that I use

884
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,500
more in things if the points are unrelated to

885
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,539
each other if one of the

886
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,750
visions 55 56 goes wrong  good or wrong one out of

887
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,619
three

888
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:41,379
if they are already in action for linear

889
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,059
with sums if they are wrong a

890
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:45,520
little mistake but the whole result is wrong if or

891
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,440
5 the fifth the pine forest and one

892
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,989
blows up all make the relationships are

893
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:52,839
like in many of our business of

894
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:55,960
nature  it is exponential of a non-linear nature

895
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,210


896
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:02,010
the consequence of an error is so

897
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:04,900
difficult to control that perhaps it is

898
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,609
better not to make a prediction

899
00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:09,789
but in this way it should not be thrown among someone

900
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:11,230
will also doubt if I do not make predictions I do

901
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,730
not plan anything how

902
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,260
I get a result we

903
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,609
get there  in the final part of the

904
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:17,859
presentation to finish linear

905
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:19,480
ambit complex ambit this also touches the

906
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,010
way we work

907
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,960
and it is obvious that in the linear all

908
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,940
plannable oriented to the execution

909
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,970
efficiency 100

910
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,609
in the complex nonlinear

911
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:30,109
we explore we have the effectiveness before the

912
00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:31,970
efficiency and also  where it

913
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,150
touches the theme of where the

914
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,710
software will work where the man will still work

915
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,800
as a job  still a little but in reality

916
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,950
a very nice character followed her and

917
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,900
luciano florid to read and made

918
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,849
a very strong distinction between the

919
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:51,050
semantic contexts those in which they have to

920
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,790
understand the meaning of what surrounds me

921
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:56,180
and the syntactic contrasts in which

922
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,099
I have to understand the  rules of the game the codes

923
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:01,730
and civil code lawyers and laws

924
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,359
the taxman for chess accountants

925
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,130
mowing the grass of a well-

926
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,619
delimited lawn with rumba that is where or

927
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:12,410
syntactic contexts where there are rules

928
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,530
the algorithm can be optimized and

929
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,660
artificial intelligence wins where I have

930
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,500
contexts

931
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,570
we must understand the meaning

932
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,130
even if we are also making

933
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,680
progress as we know but in that context

934
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,930
there is still an ability to

935
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,700
empathize there is still room for human beings

936
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,090


937
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,550
and then  a context at the start also a

938
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,440
push and keeping a bit of suspense

939
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,540
keeps all the way down to understand what

940
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,089
a difficult syntactic complex is I

941
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:40,520
'm playing you have these four cards  and

942
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,080
each of the cards with a vowel on one

943
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,160
side and a number of the other

944
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,020
normal on our

945
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,539
other number on the other if there is a rule if a

946
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:52,450
card a vowel on the side then an even

947
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,400
number on the other this is the

948
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,230
rule that

949
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,090
you have these four cards you know

950
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,680
that on the other side the two letters

951
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,630
have numbers the two numbers

952
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,510
have letters you should tell me which cards

953
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,700
in the smallest number possible you should

954
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,060
turn minimum to check if that

955
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,859
rule applied and is true

956
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,880
five seconds think about it guess

957
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,710
three out of a hundred of soleto by now in this

958
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,839
context I trust in a

959
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,040
much higher percentage

960
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,110
this challenge I will give you the result

961
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,150
on the last slide so I still consider a

962
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,410
bit as it is

963
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,660
on paper to a vowel on the side then

964
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,030
such a number on the other how many  and which

965
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,310
cards the minimum possible number

966
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,440
must I turn to be sure that all

967
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,700
the cards respect these

968
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,230
syntactic rules the complex with this

969
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,180
semantic and that of the cities usually

970
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,790
to the rais that  you know well the

971
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,590
overhead tours in which I have to try to employ

972
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,330
mitsuko I do not know that today there is a

973
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,310
few years in which if I

974
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,080
ask the right questions like what is

975
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,150
wrong in the next phase I make it the

976
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,740
capital of france on the between lyon and

977
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,260
marseille  but in loop because there is a

978
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,450
series of elements that it fails to

979
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,440
follow

980
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,450
now they are a bit more evolved there is also

981
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,750
the cpt treves the series of other things but

982
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,250
we still don't get it well to respond

983
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,530
to frames when you have to change the frame

984
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,830
when  rumba has to get out of the grass

985
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:21,400
has to go on one on a road not

986
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,770
so well anymore the

987
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,140
symbolic foundation frame roberta what

988
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,930
prevents machines from working instead

989
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,000
of men why i mention this because

990
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,120
in business in a linear context it

991
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,740
probably worked well a

992
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,840
algorithm and an algorithm could

993
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,460
also allow to clarify all the

994
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,890
rates in an orderly manner

995
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,110
I could probably make a beautiful ship

996
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,900
in a shipyard of my drawings yes

997
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,120
complicated campiano that went on the

998
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,750
lock town and worked through

999
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,180
planning and efficiency is an area

1000
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,070
in which the algorithm works in which I

1001
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:02,170
can operate in the sequential analysis mechanisms

1002
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,220
and a

1003
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,620
waterfall planning in which the project starts

1004
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,940
from the specifications of the

1005
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,640
technical design program I do  of the tests that I

1006
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,530
finally launch from the customers because a

1007
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,720
deliberate objective and the mechanism

1008
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,930
works very well was these were done

1009
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,610
well the part that every now and then could

1010
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,820
happen in a situation like in

1011
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,410
italics but usually things

1012
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,510
worked enough to have in the

1013
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,920
complexity and uncertainty you

1014
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,560
need a  change of approach baldwin

1015
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,230
things bright alduin writings these

1016
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,350
peter luckak great reference for

1017
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,170
anyone involved in management

1018
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,490
you have to abandon putting

1019
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,590
aside executions and efficiency

1020
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,900
and focus on exploration and

1021
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,430
research it is not important to do things

1022
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,100
correctly because you risk

1023
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,900
doing things correctly  to ve  then to

1024
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,300
sink a ship

1025
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,490
you have to do the right things not things

1026
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,980
in a costly way the re-execution is the

1027
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,170
value you are creating important

1028
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,060
from there many causes were born eric

1029
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:05,720
written about it start-ups but many other

1030
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,000
authors on which I do not bore you but in  bottom

1031
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,890
of the scene slider a lot of books to

1032
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,980
read and they explained how to move

1033
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,480
in a complex context

1034
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,800
obviously dealing with software did it

1035
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,190
first digital start up they

1036
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,230
invented agility but they brought to the ground and

1037
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,540
they have a little more fostered  of the models that

1038
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,910
in japan with coach thinking has

1039
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,040
ice cream yacht at jarno available for

1040
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,450
years because that model that I told you

1041
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,850
earlier is in crisis in the

1042
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:35,570
supply-demand relationship and I have to differentiate myself and

1043
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,670
therefore I have to surprise my client

1044
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,470
with new performances it is not enough for me

1045
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,180
always the same machine in large

1046
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,550
quantities was already born in the

1047
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,040
manufacturing world in the 70s 80s and the

1048
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,260
toyota well marked how to move and what

1049
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,510
beauty how to react to how  doing

1050
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,310
your usual fast agility has

1051
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,200
led to the world of

1052
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,570
digital software and then returned to the world

1053
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,470
of large companies

1054
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:00,830
these same issues on that world of the most

1055
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,200
accomplished you need a photograph a sketch

1056
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,440
model you need to have a strong hypothesis and

1057
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,140
go immediately  to be willing to

1058
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,080
change them I don't need displays I need

1059
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,150
a very light reference point and

1060
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:17,270
move to try to adapt there are

1061
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,130
tools to do this it is not

1062
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,780
the aim of this presentation to

1063
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,210
tell you that there are answers obviously yes

1064
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,900
otherwise I would not work but there is  it is first of

1065
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,410
all a mindset culture it is to be understood

1066
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:32,350
and instead of starting by talking about

1067
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,010
technology

1068
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,690
talking about what I want to do

1069
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,230
I want to make an app I want to make a

1070
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:41,530
marketplace I want to build a

1071
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,910
schiller software I want to do it I

1072
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,610
talk about that is the solution that the

1073
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:48,010
product I  where always being able

1074
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,050
to express the idea by telling the

1075
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,480
value created we don't have to focus

1076
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,950
on what we know how to do

1077
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,560
the title c  he I have partially

1078
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,960
subtitled in the abstract to this

1079
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,940
presentation and we get out

1080
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,950
of the pygmalion pygmalion syndrome character who

1081
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,550
falls in love with the work that has carved

1082
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,740
a mythical character that can be

1083
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,330
reported by many theater authors

1084
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,970
and not this falling in love with the work

1085
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,410
that makes the  greater risk than

1086
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,480
a good person and we are all good are all

1087
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,650
capable

1088
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,660
we know the technology that

1089
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,310
gigantic risk why we fall in love so

1090
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,830
much and what we know how to do that

1091
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,290
we no longer understand why

1092
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,210
whoever wants that thing is doing it and many of

1093
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,100
the innovations fail

1094
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,070
because  those who developed them

1095
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:36,070
focused on what they are doing

1096
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,860
on their solution on technologies

1097
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,100
on how to develop them bring to

1098
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,610
market the marketing that opens a company

1099
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:46,840
the first thing they do when they

1100
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,120
innovate and the brand falls the site

1101
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,350
tickets  cards

1102
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,970
are all ways to arrive are

1103
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,640
communication channels are customer

1104
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,760
king  lations are not the value the value

1105
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,900
what

1106
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,400
it is I have not explained it theodore live process

1107
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,530
very famous taken by many other

1108
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,510
authors but customers do not buy a

1109
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,070
product but they rent it to do a

1110
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,950
job a job there is a job behind

1111
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:12,280
people not  they want to buy a drill

1112
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,070
from dozens of others I am busy in mm necessarily

1113
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:19,150
between 10 mm people want to make

1114
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,490
a tragic minimum hole in the wall and we

1115
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:24,130
must be aware that maybe

1116
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,810
making a hole in the wall

1117
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,340
hi to hang a father I could

1118
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,710
also sell a tripod or  some

1119
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,740
magnets or other things because there is no need there

1120
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,850
are

1121
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,680
alternatives I am interested in understanding what is the value of

1122
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,060
the

1123
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,480
uruguay solution and not the void and benefit and it did not

1124
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,700
make it beneficial results not

1125
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,710
technical characteristics

1126
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,420
that of the proposition that

1127
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,040
there is a gigantic theory is expressed  on that

1128
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,800
mass in my pockets to say for each

1129
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,680
of the things you do even internal to that

1130
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,480
destined for this customer also

1131
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,010
a colleague of yours passes but this customer has

1132
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,380
a pro  blema and you forget about

1133
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,000
ourselves our technology does

1134
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,609
not exist you do not exist and like when you

1135
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:05,859
have a vision between a company you do not talk

1136
00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:07,420
about yourself there is a customer there is a

1137
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,490
market there is a market segment that

1138
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:11,109
has  a problem ago and today he is

1139
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:13,089
solving it because the problems in any case I

1140
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:15,780
solve them in a new way maybe they are

1141
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,520
the current solution he has limits he is

1142
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,190
dissatisfied I propose an alternative

1143
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,510
that has advantages

1144
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,160
here are the advantages and make him make

1145
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,680
the leap from the current solution  to the

1146
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,880
new solution means that I am

1147
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,230
creating value

1148
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:32,170
if instead I have a solution for a

1149
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,190
problem it has no value

1150
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:38,030
and value is there only if I or awareness

1151
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:40,850
of a significant problem that is strong for a

1152
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:43,610
fairly large market I know that that

1153
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:45,350
market today is not satisfied with the

1154
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,900
how it has work around and

1155
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,690
solutions with limits if I have

1156
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,970
a solution that knows an advantage

1157
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,280
over the different alternatives and the

1158
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,770
solution these advantages are such as to

1159
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:58,850
make

1160
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,860
the sw  itch to my client I am producing

1161
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,710
value this is a formulation of the

1162
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,390
many in the valley plus position but I could

1163
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:06,860
do it for myself as an employee of

1164
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,550
a company if I have my boss who falls

1165
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,080
the problems that solves them in a

1166
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,210
different way from the alternatives to a software

1167
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:17,020
in  artificial intelligence from an

1168
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,360
outsourced solution from

1169
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,400
a lithuanian programmer

1170
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,320
any alternative I can have

1171
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,300
in my presence I am creating value

1172
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,000
for those organizations

1173
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,280
the great reference of these

1174
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,660
issues is the one who wrote the

1175
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,190
innovator's dilemma that anyone does not have

1176
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,080
scudetto must read and

1177
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,150
clayton christensen who passed away recently and

1178
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,950
who also introduced the theme of jobs to

1179
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:43,340
be done in the end I have to make the

1180
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,290
deal do a job to get something

1181
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:47,360
on the walls I have to know why they buy at the

1182
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,390
drill I don't have to start talking about

1183
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:52,490
power  of the kind of tips the

1184
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:55,220
length of the cable how much it weighs do I have

1185
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,200
to things come after on the fundamentals but

1186
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,240
all  I start I focus on why he

1187
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,070
wants to use the thing that the commercials and the

1188
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,410
environment because today he can't do it

1189
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,240
without the solution and what limits

1190
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,560
the other alternatives could give

1191
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:11,150
the famous kodak it was designed

1192
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:13,580
they had a digital camera but

1193
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,350
didn't understand it  well what where

1194
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:17,000
the complexity of the difficult mind could go

1195
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,500


1196
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,270
we get to the theme of saying don't

1197
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,890
make yourself donate because I could get

1198
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:23,780
to the end of this it's okay it's all

1199
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,240
so complex uncontrollable and

1200
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,040
whatever else we try everything until

1201
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,480
something works but so it would be

1202
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,690
expensive and then gives them

1203
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,730
those who have something that produces

1204
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,579
value from her framework that pushes

1205
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:40,040
towards becoming a bit more scientists if

1206
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,540
there is someone who has taught us how to

1207
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,720
investigate the explore the unknown

1208
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,200
are fired from 1600 onwards maybe

1209
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,810
even a little  before some houses that

1210
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,660
have told us starting everything is not

1211
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,220
making the books that have taught us

1212
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,040
how the world works and believing everyone

1213
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,839
that women have four

1214
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,130
fewer users than men and how

1215
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:03,020
all the greatest scientists closed in 1300

1216
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,450
even if you can count them and from the same

1217
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,089
public number to a success but

1218
00:47:08,089 --> 00:47:09,800
because they said it because a pseudo

1219
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,720
Aristotle a book they had found

1220
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,520
was written like this  is the one who

1221
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,319
wrote the most important of the

1222
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:17,359
real observations science

1223
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,550
taught us that instead we start from the

1224
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:20,630
observations

1225
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,329
we look for an inductive board that

1226
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:25,460
creates hypotheses then we reduce the

1227
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,380
consequences we create experiments and

1228
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,240
try to understand if this

1229
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,940
progressive principle of exploration of

1230
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,980
validation for my hypothesis is the

1231
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:36,170
principle of the scientific macro a thousand

1232
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,180
criticisms also linen state camaro many

1233
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,180
other characters but the theme remains strong

1234
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,780
remains strong we can base blind

1235
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,069
observation and it is to build the

1236
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:47,900
experiments to validate it the business

1237
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,240
can follow the same sword so not

1238
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,670
a business  plan to execute but a

1239
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,369
business model that I f  to get out of the

1240
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:58,490
bet from a bale breaks throw the

1241
00:47:58,490 --> 00:47:59,690
thing and I hope it goes well

1242
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:01,760
I can build with a

1243
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,520
scientific approach a sequence of verifying

1244
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:04,970
hypotheses

1245
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:07,310
and then instead of being efficient

1246
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:10,130
precisely what slide here told a

1247
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,810
few years ago in a pisa excuse lab

1248
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:14,930
was really  scandalous why to say

1249
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,520
that a certain phase of the innovation process

1250
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,270


1251
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,960
instead of being efficient precise

1252
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,099
quantitative with the overview

1253
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,740
with the control of everything I must

1254
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:28,400
instead be fast frugal vertical focus

1255
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,569
with the housing approach with

1256
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:31,310
learning so that every

1257
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,890
quick step spends  little money it takes little

1258
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,109
time and I know something new

1259
00:48:36,109 --> 00:48:37,520
this would have been something

1260
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,400
so difficult it is instead the cycle that

1261
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,410
lies under all these methods that

1262
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,540
resembles that japanese cyclicals

1263
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,750


1264
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:49,090
mike 15 taught us at the bill gates shore i

1265
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:51,670
build something quickly and

1266
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,650
focused with learning at the

1267
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,140
core rather than executing we do

1268
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,990
things here apply fast dirty

1269
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:00,670
trying to get to

1270
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,290
learn something new quickly by

1271
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,790
next Thursday they must know

1272
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:04,270
something new

1273
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,880
understand if the hypothesis is correct yes they are

1274
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,870
tools

1275
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,150
obviously yes the tools come from

1276
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,820
many manuals other free where the

1277
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,320
moment is the one written by  alex

1278
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,590
upsets is the invincible company that

1279
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:20,950
has tried to put together the

1280
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,050
experiences of start-ups and with the

1281
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,060
experiences of very large companies and

1282
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,890
find frames to do both

1283
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:29,520
the exploration and the exploitation of

1284
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,860
existing businesses but there is something

1285
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,570
underneath  all this is our

1286
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:37,030
willingness and desire to immediately

1287
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,640
leave our workshop from our

1288
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,770
laboratory in which we are building a

1289
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,210
solution go and take a punch in the

1290
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,220
face to make us contradict our

1291
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,870
hypotheses every time the experiment

1292
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:48,190
confirms our

1293
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,320
useless hypotheses every time  in which instead

1294
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,240
the experiment shows that we had

1295
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,140
a wrong idea

1296
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,330
we imp  plowed something new but

1297
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:56,770
it happens that when the pride

1298
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:59,380
of technology fails to enter a

1299
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,730
salesman,

1300
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,350
a company will never go and explore the market

1301
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:04,690
because its focus is on selling and instead

1302
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:06,490
you have to go and

1303
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:08,500
learn these methods when  companies

1304
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,470
carry on with their world of sales

1305
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,570
fail to bring much when,

1306
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:15,130
on the other hand, or even very

1307
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:17,440
structured companies that open up

1308
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,120
different paths the exploration begins

1309
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,580
to become interesting and there is an order

1310
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,350
in these things we start from

1311
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,940
explore the riskiest things first

1312
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,400
and then the

1313
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,560
less risky things which is different from

1314
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,940
what you would do in a business plan where

1315
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,920
the first thing you do is the foundation

1316
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,110
to get to the roof of the house but

1317
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,540
if your doubt is that people at the

1318
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,390
end they will not want perfect because you

1319
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:42,740
do not want to sell in Thailand the rains

1320
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,110
will not be enough better maybe

1321
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,330
first the next thing to do is to do an

1322
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,680
experiment for  r understand if the roof is

1323
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,260
accepted by the market and

1324
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,170
if I no longer have the order of

1325
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,720
chronological sequential construction of my

1326
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,540
solution in which slowly I build

1327
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,640
and software I build the machine I

1328
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,280
build and the house I have to go in

1329
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,220
order of learning on the hypotheses

1330
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,140
that I have the most at risk on the market those

1331
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,140
that would blow everything

1332
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,360
so we are the risks with the

1333
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,220
inter experiment thanks fast

1334
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,530
economic progressive the most famous and

1335
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:20,280
simpler do a good interview

1336
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,440
I will quote you some now there is no more

1337
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,130
time however  the pal pilot in which

1338
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:27,210
the entrepreneur goes around with a

1339
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:30,140
fake from the pilot in which he simulates

1340
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,250
interacting with others to see what

1341
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,440
reaction they had because the fear that

1342
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,560
these tools were not accepted

1343
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,940
in a meeting more famous and

1344
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,910
told by all  but the

1345
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:47,010
lake apartment another experiment that I tell

1346
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,740
in the book as well as recently

1347
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,000
decathlon you saw that he made the

1348
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,610
masks for velux al  between a beautiful

1349
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,190
company follow up there because it makes a

1350
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:59,580
lot of use even if not in the world of

1351
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,640
digital and the sea with a product with

1352
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,530
a perfect window does

1353
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,870
experiments and

1354
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:10,740
continuous learning its focus for innovation

1355
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,599
I close with a very interesting example

1356
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,180
that the one that compares 2  approach to

1357
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,260
innovation that of the

1358
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:20,619
wright brothers eddie lang lei it is interesting that

1359
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:23,619
you can go to deepen this at the

1360
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:25,960
time when the first

1361
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,790
exploration was done to attempt a plane

1362
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:30,250
there were wright brothers on the

1363
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:33,310
poor and bad side and chiang lei who had

1364
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,530
all the funding  in the world he had the

1365
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:38,230
support of the press and

1366
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:41,920
he did a great job he

1367
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,839
spent a lot of money a lot of

1368
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,089
funding got to do two

1369
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:48,460
huge experiments of 1 in which

1370
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,810
the plane crashed into

1371
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:52,210
wires the other crashed into the  river

1372
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,130
and failed miserably failed

1373
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,869
in this huge final experiment

1374
00:52:55,869 --> 00:52:59,890
times wrote arr  We will live to fly

1375
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:01,960
in a thousand years if he hasn't made it

1376
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,819
right out of hand after the

1377
00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:06,190
wright brothers took off because why

1378
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:09,550
wright brothers while from ang lee he

1379
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:11,740
made two attempts to five attempts

1380
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,290
a day for many years is the first

1381
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:16,060
attempt was to put a wheel

1382
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,349
horizontally this also says it to the

1383
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:20,829
museum the default of the ford in the

1384
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:22,569
first experiment they wanted to understand what

1385
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:24,460
will happen any horizontal wheel in

1386
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,680
terms of being able to

1387
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,300
fly and they started with the bicycle

1388
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,849
creating there in front of charlie a lot

1389
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:33,460
this this slide because just an

1390
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,790
approach to hacking the product to

1391
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,650
understand something even before

1392
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,839
starting to make the big plane that

1393
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,119
you see here plummeting damage only

1394
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,339
at the end the interview this this the

1395
00:53:45,339 --> 00:53:48,130
blanca is another reference

1396
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:50,470
keywords to be bothered that therefore

1397
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,109
let's not try to do perfect things for that

1398
00:53:52,109 --> 00:53:54,550
we will arrive too late there is this

1399
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,619
interesting graph devastated holder

1400
00:53:56,619 --> 00:53:58,270
the length of the b  usiness plan is

1401
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:00,460
proportional to the risk of failure

1402
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,079
as written many things it means

1403
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,430
that this too much is lost a lot of time and

1404
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,950
steed to read cash

1405
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:11,770
this stage for what for us mica

1406
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:14,530
resist you have read the cantaro toyama

1407
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:15,820
who worked in microsoft

1408
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,470
the first three chapters to throw yourself

1409
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,510
stop read them very interesting

1410
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:22,060
because it says that the technology

1411
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,160
the amplification of the processes if you have

1412
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,410
solid processes cerete da lorenzi

1413
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:28,869
processes are not money you will make chaos is

1414
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:32,470
this technology also arranges

1415
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:34,630
elections or other things like that and

1416
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,800
more sections

1417
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,060
read the philosophy of birth

1418
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,820
scientific is also an exceptional block basketball

1419
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:43,240
century made ascent because it

1420
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,280
wants to talk about collaboration also

1421
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,770
this is another good book a little more

1422
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:50,530
for those who love anthropology

1423
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:54,400
sociology skips all these two slides

1424
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,609
9 lawful but they talked about what touches

1425
00:54:57,609 --> 00:54:59,079
large organizations  how all

1426
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:00,970
this affects the role of manager the

1427
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:03,190
role of the operational who  it

1428
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,920
completely skips the chain of command and you

1429
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,260
add also the smart work is

1430
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,060
really jumping everything even in

1431
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,040
very structured companies these

1432
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,700
instead of the first ones is at the bottom and this is the

1433
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,630
result of the first game and seven and

1434
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:22,690
are the precise eight that does not

1435
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:27,550
deliberately think  to be able to do and

1436
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:29,619
now they talk now because you

1437
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:31,269
came to

1438
00:55:31,269 --> 00:55:34,539
practice ball at 8 to play dinner and

1439
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,429
therefore I don't even pen questions but

1440
00:55:36,429 --> 00:55:37,749
you have my contacts and if you want to

1441
00:55:37,749 --> 00:55:38,729
learn let's

1442
00:55:38,729 --> 00:55:41,259
connect on social networks here

1443
00:55:41,259 --> 00:55:44,309
I will deepen you
