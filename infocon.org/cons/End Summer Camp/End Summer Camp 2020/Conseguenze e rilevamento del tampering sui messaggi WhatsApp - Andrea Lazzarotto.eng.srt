1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,350
yes exact therefore as you have already said the

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,230
title relating to the tampering

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,460
of bursary messages and cheerful poles

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,350
possibility of detecting this type of

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:25,640
operations briefly I deal

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,720
with consultancy training them forensics and

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,040
also there software development and

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,160
mobile applications so for this

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,290
reason I am very interested  also

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,910
analyze how

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,540
other people's applications work and see what

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,200
they do

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,289
in particular tonight we will talk

14
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,420
about the android version of aware and for

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,250
the same reason I talked about before

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,199
that is working and trying to bring

17
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,210
as some forensics

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,460
I also like to develop

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,710
tools that  I use to work

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,149
so not only use tools

21
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,090
other brands of mine there are a couple of

22
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,159
and with suspicion found on the net

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,080
recoverable cargo cipe motors are

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,030
also included within the instruction that

25
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,040
therefore the fact of working an illusion

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,570
of forensic smokers has led to

27
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,090
think about the fact that it

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,360
is a workshop anyway is a platform d  the chats that

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,310
are in great demand there were

30
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,729
sometimes asked to extract

31
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,119
messages from chats on mobile phones and

32
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,270
rudy in any case trillion to certify

33
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,790
that those messages were in the phone and

34
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,020
we drink extrapolated precisely past

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,390
in particular it is an application that is

36
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,100
directly the most  used in Italy it

37
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,110
has a market setting of 85

38
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,670
percent so imagine that

39
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,969
substantially almost all Italians

40
00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:00,030
use whatsapp on smartphones and

41
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,939
sometimes there are problems and analysis

42
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,520
because in a database backups that

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,530
are made on the external memory or

44
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,389
a memory anyway  easily

45
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,000
accessible,

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,340
those who are protected in

47
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,600
the asp networks and the original database of

48
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,940
awareness and within the powerful data of the

49
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,740
eagle and buildings to sex are encrypted in

50
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,560
some cases even the operators

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,420
who have to seize

52
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,090
mobile phones and extract the

53
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,390
they always manage to extract the exact one in a

54
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,900
digital way, that is, extracting  or the

55
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,750
database but in some cases

56
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,300
screenshots of the

57
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,980
header are made they win as a last

58
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,570
resort in any case there is no other

59
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,540
possibility these screens and the governments

60
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,020
of barriers in the world are interested

61
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,520
in the fact that in any case it is an

62
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,739
intent messaging platform that does not pass

63
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,020
for the telephone network we say

64
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,440
traditional then canceled the bag but

65
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,270
if you have to see the messages you go

66
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,400
directly into the mobile phone or of

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,830
whoever sent them who received them in

68
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,200
particular for example the united kingdom

69
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,620
in 2017 complained that the workshop was

70
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,890
not our ipad of the games  to

71
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,760
operate their illegal activities and in the

72
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
aims of software sap has admitted that the

73
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,470
mean alps have also found a

74
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,299
convenient tool and use of awareness and

75
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:35,310
therefore they were working to try to

76
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,390
mitigate this phenomenon and therefore

77
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,910
no one has asked this question

78
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,299
that is, let's try to  to think like

79
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,489
people an attacker then many

80
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,440
the three people put

81
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,810
we want to try to tamper with the

82
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,810
messages in our mobile phone for

83
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,430
example by modifying those that already

84
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,200
exist or even going

85
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,079
close to inserting it from scratch

86
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,280
inventing the index it would

87
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,560
never remain received never sent we go to

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,000
insert help it is however a goal

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,820
we say that we expose it is to do it  in a

90
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,239
smartphone that does not have root permissions

91
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,649
because that cannot be easy in

92
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,959
quotation marks but trying to do it on the

93
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,769
cell phone that on some times

94
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,500
we say 11 unlocked in this sense and

95
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,650
I would like to do it without leaving

96
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,879
visible traces so that if we do not go and

97
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,919
analyze  the mobile phone or from

98
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,509
another person

99
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,099
this other person does not realize

100
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:40,690
that we have made some alterations

101
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,600
for this reason I thought of doing two types of

102
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,930
experiment the first is related to

103
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,480
modifying the already existing message

104
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,990
so we simply go and want to

105
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,720
retouch a message that

106
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,880
actually maybe it was sent

107
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,210
by another person let's

108
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,190
change the  content so that it

109
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:10,010
returns to us with and in the other case instead an

110
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,720
actor operation could be to

111
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,910
try to insert a message that does not

112
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,300
exist but we want to pretend that a

113
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,880
person has entered has sent

114
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,870
a message for example obsessive

115
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,430
or with threats and then

116
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,240
go and complain to someone as an

117
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,360
example with the help undermine people I have

118
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,100
prepared a very simple

119
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,010
conversation which is this is I said

120
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,920
hello how's the answer hello well you

121
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,830
that this person to write

122
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,440
I wanted to tell you that we do not proceed with

123
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,390
work because the estimate is in the  done

124
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,450
is too much then I answer ok the agreement

125
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:53,860
hello

126
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,240
this is the original conversation that

127
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,080
was actually exchanged between me

128
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,860
and really aimed at me

129
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,960
to do this test so these are

130
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,270
the original messages as they

131
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,480
also passed through the whatsapp network

132
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,830
but let's remember that  the archive will

133
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,870
however we keep them after they have

134
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,760
been transferred to the back other than

135
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,070
a copy on the ser  ver but if only his ct is born they

136
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,500


137
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,440
will have to pay a way to

138
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,080
try to do these operations

139
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,230
the first idea is to try to

140
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,530
bring the chat database and

141
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,630
portray it outside because inside the

142
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,080
break

143
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,060
we said that it is protected as

144
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,940
we can  access directly in which

145
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,390
hamas step on it externally a

146
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,190
very practical function both from its own past and

147
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,810
in part we can use the

148
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,990
backup functionality via the web

149
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,940
rai is this if it lets it do

150
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,390
the application is under construction so

151
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,910
we want to transfer the messages of the

152
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,070
smartphone to  a device

153
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,960
that English could be unlocked or

154
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,480
otherwise accessible through making

155
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,070
better books binds

156
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,230
after which at this point that we have

157
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,950
moved the web based externally

158
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,480
we can try to modify it and

159
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,340
whose impact difficult to try to do

160
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,830
without leaving a trace finally we

161
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,320
transfer the  messages in the

162
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,840
starting smartphone this is the idea

163
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,229
that is the idea of the plan  action and

164
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:29,080
let's see if you go out to do these things

165
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,120
I want to specify a small

166
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,640
technical parenthesis and in the tests I did for

167
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,440
these presentations

168
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,380
the motion size environment was used but in

169
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,419
andar you can use a smartphone

170
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,450
that has been made and unlock the

171
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,070
permissions  of rock we say that gianni

172
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,500
motion at rest because it allows you to

173
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,840
start a virtual machine that has

174
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,540
both google and activatable applications and

175
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,540
also direct permissions while the

176
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,790
bricklayer the officer who white my

177
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,090
opinion has not donated more of these

178
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,880
very beautiful things

179
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,680
so let's see  briefly how it works

180
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,970
the procedure is backed up

181
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,810
simply from the

182
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,060
whatsapp setting you have to wait a few

183
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,950
minutes until all the multimedia

184
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,760
files still have sins on the new phone with

185
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,650
this case the emulator on installs

186
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,690
then a first thing to try to

187
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,729
modify existing message

188
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:39,919
we have to close  the new total

189
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,409
side and this we can do from

190
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,050
the android possia lines  mo go on the

191
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,030
issues not knowing how to do this

192
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,570
edition

193
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,910
this allows us to

194
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,680
completely terminate the application and after

195
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,720
which the fact of having carried out this

196
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,390
operation initially brings these

197
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,150
database of the conversions in this case

198
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,220
it is applications with their own

199
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,820
risks that the  ater there is a state of

200
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,710
languages because maybe a certain

201
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,230
state there were some operations with

202
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,730
stowed based as we say of the

203
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,980
transactions and therefore it remains cool

204
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,600
log file and therefore of the existing state division

205
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,960
to avoid this problem

206
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,480
we have to make it a very

207
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,300
simple trick consists in  show a

208
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,320
flight to be tamed command simply by

209
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,480
asking it to print the estimate of the

210
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,460
database and that is the structure of the

211
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,500
tables the liquid to print it in doing

212
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,460
this practically yes be light inside

213
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,340
the bass finds an open log file and

214
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,740
closes the file status correctly

215
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,400
without the  'eleven chain on the bot

216
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,090
this point I can which arms the data

217
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,170
yielded by the dis  positive that I am using

218
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,660
do not do the experiments on the computer and

219
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,490
I do this with the

220
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,890
development tools in this case adb

221
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,130
adb bull evening and that path there allows me

222
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,960
to copy the rezzato aware database

223
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,320
inside the computer and these

224
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,080
things I can  to do on this path that is

225
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,660
given to do on the protected data of the asp

226
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,550
only because it is using the device

227
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,180
with broken I should not have done it on the

228
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,580
original device because I would have had

229
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,379
a permissions error substantially

230
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:40,649
then but the doctors silence at this

231
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:43,289
point can know it is however first  I can

232
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:45,929
use a software as a sequel to the

233
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:47,970
browsers there are cut and thuram and

234
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,369
in any case in this is one of the most

235
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:52,919
discussed it is ours the structure in

236
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,889
database tables and therefore the useful

237
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,559
tables our goal is to

238
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,389
try to verify the sources in

239
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:01,769
their own  data

240
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:04,319
avoiding that, as before,

241
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,659
things can then be detected so that the analysis

242
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:11,519
that is looking for the messenger table in particular is detected

243
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,269


244
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:15,689
I go to f  are filter keywords

245
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:16,949
that I remember that I am inside the

246
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:19,259
message is quickly individual

247
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:21,720
the message is of interest in this

248
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,609
case the message was I wanted to tell you that

249
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:27,059
we cannot because

250
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:29,039
I have estimated this for real but I want to

251
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,599
modify it so I click inside

252
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:32,159
the cell with  if i was working on

253
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,619
spreadsheets in town hall the rest

254
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:36,419
in this case the spirit i wanted to tell

255
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:38,429
you keep going ok let's proceed with the

256
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:41,639
work in this comfortable way so that if

257
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,220
i wanted i could tell the person

258
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,049
once i understand that you wrote

259
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:48,779
that we were going  in then situation of

260
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:49,739


261
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:52,079
their actually but happy that I did

262
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,539
so simply by visiting saving

263
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:58,259
the files at this point we want to

264
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,569
replace it will be modified in the

265
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,549
device as long as we use

266
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:05,129
set the tools to do it

267
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:08,629
we have to stop again or sap and

268
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,649
correct the database as we

269
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,209
did before

270
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,059
after which we use the command of towards

271
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:19,169
what I have exposed inside the  folder

272
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:23,609
in the editing device adb bush a

273
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:27,419
file and the catola in this case not what

274
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,759
happens the synod see the chat and the

275
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,029
in the bag brand another time I go to

276
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:38,209
find this content and then

277
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:40,910
before it said that no work was done

278
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,089
now of  snakes now even we will do it or

279
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:47,559
not this is concludes let's

280
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:52,009
experiment after it becomes let's try to take

281
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:54,589
a little step they call us back to do the

282
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:56,540
second experiment insert a

283
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,899
false message to simplify

284
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:01,939
life because we have a table with

285
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:03,499
many columns

286
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:06,829
the easiest thing should

287
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:07,999
be to take a  message that

288
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:10,879
already exists and duplicate it in this case

289
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,920
the message that I have just modified or

290
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,619
stolen and duplicate and this is done

291
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:17,389
by applying on the right on with her

292
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:20,679
on the row and making a duplicate here

293
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,329
then now the sign first of all that

294
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:25,339
this is duplicate loses a column that

295
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:27,499
is called  ask why in

296
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:28,939
the written table constraints of that column

297
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:31,160
of the coke series and therefore cannot

298
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,100
be the  value the same as before

299
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,249
and moreover this line automatically

300
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,459
from the sequel light system gets merged

301
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:45,049
oo as you can see there are almost 900 800

302
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:47,749
lines more because this changes the state

303
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:49,939
several days after the chat and therefore

304
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:53,350
we have been other messages in the meantime

305
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,720
and now we have to alter a

306
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,279
Athens corner for receiving the message

307
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,740
because otherwise it would be exactly

308
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,339
identical on the thousandth in the second

309
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:07,040
substantially of the previous message

310
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,499
so it would be very very strange and

311
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:11,509
could arouse suspicion so

312
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:14,299
we want to alter the date in dedication moment

313
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,160
maybe a few seconds later

314
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,959
in the previous message taken also or in

315
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,470
any case we work this  'area

316
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,240
to do this we must remember that

317
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,839
the columns that indicate the times ten are

318
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:28,369
the date on which the message was created

319
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,410
and the times the chair

320
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,749
of the with which the microphone

321
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:34,220
recorded having received it

322
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,649
are both in right format at

323
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:38,660
multiply by a thousand so we can

324
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,119
give one of many  the

325
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:45,079
online converters to switch from barely

326
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:48,120
interest us to times friends

327
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,880
what in reality is not so

328
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,260
important not if we go write

329
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,089
we say that it should be a value 16

330
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:59,500
bad random it is better to try to do it

331
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,450
with a prefix similar to the

332
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,120
previous ones that is to the other messages  that

333
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,430
are around they all have the same

334
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,040
prefix we do it impossible and basically

335
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,209
nobody will notice

336
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,560
this thing however if

337
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,399
we try to modify we repeat

338
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,160
the balance 9 while on the test phone

339
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,810
with the engine

340
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,029
we notice a small problem that the

341
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:27,190
message that we have a crime and  it was going

342
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:27,970
to wind up

343
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,839
anyway even though i'm no fit

344
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,279
old she finished it because

345
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,810
presumably also so quite

346
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,209
expected past that the messages for her

347
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,459
of size if this is the

348
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:47,740
high political message of all and in large

349
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,399
numbers basically

350
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,660
besides invention l  '

351
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,870
chat preview keeps appearing the message

352
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,910
that is it was last sent that

353
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,170
in this case from what I have

354
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,220
sent a link to a site and because

355
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,720
this reference observed

356
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,660
separately with ichat to the reference to the

357
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,399
last message that must appear

358
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,769
the cover I do not like to make corrections

359
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:14,589
on this point first we take

360
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:16,209
all the messages that may have

361
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,279
been  beaten after or not in the

362
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,300
specific one for the we increase the

363
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,550
node that the order of the relative villas

364
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,949
is correct

365
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:29,440
after which we modify the references that

366
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,500
are in the chat table so that the

367
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,510
customer first last message received

368
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,769
each are pointed to the message

369
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:43,720
appeared again  here in color

370
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,930
we cover the database again we go to

371
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,529
see that actually entered a

372
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:53,259
message with a crisis so that it must

373
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:56,560
be must be a finance any

374
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,899
pay well find trust of the chat it

375
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:01,839
then became results did not write

376
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,339
the take a weapon then wrote to me

377
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:07,089
a message that of grace and this is

378
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,459
all within the chats following

379
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,760
correctly the exception dates and

380
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,250
the order let's say that then it is displayed

381
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,839
on the phone that these see all

382
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,119
the other no I have no reason for this

383
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,390
chat action occurred and connected liberable

384
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,679
summarizing the results we

385
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,600
obtained are these we risked

386
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
a message  without any one

387
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,720
certainly thinks if the value who sent

388
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,520
messages to serve not better the

389
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,659
written is another thing

390
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,210
we will see that actually the passages

391
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,539
are different so one of the two has

392
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,380
cheated but asks the god who has

393
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,600
collapsed let's not do style they

394
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,440
will speak the essay of the  cola altered

395
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,150
after which we are

396
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,030
a message that did not exist however

397
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,470
this operation requires more

398
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,900
attention because we must be

399
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,940
careful not to mistake the order to notice some

400
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,930
jumps strange things politics bulls and if

401
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,060
someone but seeing it in detail

402
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,160
could notice that there are big

403
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,010
holes present increases  of things of this

404
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,570
type we say that to modify it well

405
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,520
you have to be careful it's easy to miss

406
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,280
but you can

407
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,420
in fact do the sestriere done in a correct way

408
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,800


409
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,720
substantially then going to make

410
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,020
the telephone with an

411
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,570
open source commercial tool, however, printing the

412
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,940
messages or making screenshots

413
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,820
certainly it is in all probability

414
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,790
no one will realize that these

415
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,950
messages have been modified therefore they

416
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,560
are  messages that actually do not

417
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,060
correspond to what was

418
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,790
transmitted to the lands

419
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,610
as the last thing I wanted to report that

420
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,260
obviously

421
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,420
the changes were made from the device the

422
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,940
minute the backup was made or the backup was

423
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,650
restored another time in the original

424
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,480
mobile phone  so the one

425
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,390
without routh that the user commonly uses

426
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:09,050
and pristino works

427
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,110
perfectly what they return

428
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,510
there is also most

429
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,410
people do not have the setting

430
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,170
enabled in the settings that allows you to

431
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,400
see when the user's security code

432
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,500
has changed in theory every

433
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,180
once an editor installs

434
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,770
rossato raga  zza themes should warn

435
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,140
that this contact areas installed or in

436
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,690
any case to a different country

437
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,390
this for security reasons however and

438
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,280
it is not anti wheeling fontaine and many

439
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,500
inactive people such as the

440
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,630


441
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,640
contact I asked him but you saw the

442
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,320
message that I changed codes

443
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,920
security 23 times i see nobel did not

444
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,510
see it they gave me send it the one on the

445
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,210
right is its screening on the phone

446
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,810
so the original messages and

447
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,550
there is no warning messages

448
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,380
changed some of itself because it had not

449
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,430
activated the  'option in your phone

450
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,480
this let's say more or less concludes

451
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,560
the argument protesting tonight

452
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,430
regarding the tampering of

453
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,190
messages on the android platform

454
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,560
warning that there will be developments in the

455
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,860
near future to follow mentally on

456
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,190
the web and on social networks and I will go to deal with

457
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,870
the topic of  tampering with

458
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,870
super formaio messages is too severe

459
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,030
facts let's say in about a month in

460
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,050
unedited mode on another occasion

461
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:43,430
here is this tend  and for having collided between

462
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,070
experience for possible questions

463
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,270
we also arrive our

464
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,710
telegram group that in any case you are also

465
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,380
registered which eventually I could

466
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,300
possibly see them directly without

467
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,490
letters we turn the girl and a thousand

468
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:04,120
more and the next
