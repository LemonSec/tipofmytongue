1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,370
hello everyone i am umberto i work in the

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,110
public administration in the presidency

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,700
of the council of ministers at

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,789
the civil protection department

5
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:15,769
here i mainly deal with

6
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:20,670
software development and security because

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,380
this talk because we often always

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,119
talk about the public administration

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,810
as a reality not attentive to

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,659
security issues

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:38,010
many times it has been so many times the

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,930
issues brought forward by the public

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,190
administration in the field of

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,129
security have not been, let's say,

15
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,920
so exhaustive as to make it clear that in the

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,379
public administration, however,

17
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,690
security and in this case computer security

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,199
in particular is and

19
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,530
weighs heavily  very serious what I am

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,990
going to deal with

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,910
is a very important issue that I

22
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,150
personally am also trying to

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,540
implement obviously before the

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,430
implementation in the public

25
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,760
administration we go through the analysis

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,600
of what this can entail the

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,100
legislation that maybe allows you to do a

28
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,660
certain  type of share  but the intention to

29
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,960
implement this is therefore we are talking

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,620
about responsible disclosure policy is an

31
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,960
issue that was initiated in the public

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,520
administration and therefore I give it

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,640
credit to gianluca varisco when he

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,060
started taking care of

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,040
security within the digital team

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,650
and  it is something that we who continue to

37
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,790
work the public administration

38
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,790
are trying to bring

39
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,350
forward from what is boat and

40
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,170
first of all fights from the idea that the

41
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,190
protection of motion

42
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,570
communication technology systems and data from

43
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,070
security problems must be

44
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,830
one of the  founding bases of every

45
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,600
organization in this case precisely

46
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,810
of the public administration

47
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,390
the goal is to make a continuous

48
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,080
simple man of the systems then go to

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,730
identify and solve the

50
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,670
vulnerabilities that come but should not be

51
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,400
found he obviously did not deal with

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,220
issues concerning gd likes

53
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,390
and  anything else but it is in fact everything

54
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,390
connected because in the moment in cu  i

55
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,550
is a system is violated obviously

56
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,010
the

57
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,280
data contained within

58
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,910
the system itself can also be violated

59
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,470
regarding the vulnerability disclosure

60
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,620
is not unturned in the sense that

61
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,900
this is already defined is well defined is

62
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:23,090
structured in iso 29.100 47 where

63
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,580
in fact, guidelines are identified

64
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,620
on how to

65
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,630
receive reports on the potential

66
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,420
weightability on how these must

67
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,080
be disclosed and then give

68
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,170
information on the techniques for the

69
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,700
disclosure of vulnerabilities and

70
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,920
also examples are brought in the attachments

71
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,940
so let's say that if in the

72
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,269
public administration  should

73
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:59,900
a should go frame

74
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,680
a regulatory aspect certainly

75
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,880
laiso in question is very helpful I

76
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,350
interrupt the second one because we

77
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,510
continue to see the first slide and

78
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,530
not the other schoolchildren and therefore it fits

79
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,930
better now they are scrolling yes

80
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,470
so go ahead and do the iso

81
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,570
field  anyway here's this it is  what

82
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,639
we think therefore we say that

83
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,409
for the public administration which in

84
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:34,860
any case should normal

85
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,830
an initiative such an activity is

86
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,099
the fact that it is already behind it with a

87
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:45,090
standard in particular laiso 20 947

88
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,129
this greatly facilitates the

89
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,469
process of formalization

90
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:53,660
of the  '' activity

91
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,389
what is the responsable discourse policy

92
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,750
is nothing more than an approach that allows to

93
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,350
report vulnerabilities by providing an

94
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,500
organization with the possibility of

95
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,370
identifying and applying

96
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,560
countermeasures to solve that

97
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,560
vulnerability found is a

98
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,260
nng process is a

99
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,880
controlled and ethical reporting process  where

100
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,790
a researcher is a security expert or helps

101
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,500
companies and then public

102
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,960
administrations to identify these

103
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,770
problems by providing an essential contribution

104
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,510


105
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,340
unfortunately in the newspapers we have often

106
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,669
often read about communications and

107
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:44,250
notifications of vulnerabilities which unfortunately

108
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,640
then resulted in a complaint

109
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,729
against  people who gave

110
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:53,300
but  gari in an ethical manner

111
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,250
in certain specific problems

112
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,050
here is going to implement a stay

113
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,200
of spouses policy in fact helps and

114
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,670
supports anyone who wants to collaborate in

115
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,320
this case with the public

116
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,830
administration to be sure that in

117
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,320
any case a notification of a

118
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,780
vulnerability obviously does not translate

119
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,220
into a complaint complaint  legal this is

120
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,530
one of the main

121
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,760
approaches what it means to become

122
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,860
a responsible discourse a bit there it

123
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,110
means going to define a series of

124
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,760
transparent rules of fact of the processes

125
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,940
to then go to report the

126
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,430
vulnerability with a

127
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,110
responsible disclosure policy then

128
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,620
when a researcher a

129
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,810
security expert goes to discover a

130
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,960
vulnerability he must be informed of

131
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,150
all

132
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,990
the steps that must be carried out

133
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,340
for the notification itself, perhaps by

134
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,800
publishing a key to go to

135
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,090
India in a safe manner the notification

136
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,370
a '  email where the procedure was to be contacted

137
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,320
sso can be de facto free

138
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,080
but must ensure that the subject

139
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,870
also anonymously can

140
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,070
communicate and notify the anomaly

141
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,930
found obviously there are

142
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,700
some important aspects to be addressed

143
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,900
both by the whistleblower and

144
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,150
by the recipient and obviously the one who reports

145
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,640
when it becomes aware it

146
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,330
discovers a vulnerability it must

147
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,920
obviously not cause damage to the system

148
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,720
to the system itself

149
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,560
therefore

150
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,940
it must not actually

151
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,310
protect users from damage or

152
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:15,290
loss must always behave in

153
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,660
compliance with the applicable legislation and

154
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,840
regulations to ask

155
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,350
obviously support in case there are

156
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,010
doubts but above all you should never

157
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,130
listen to any data or

158
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,849
information that would be easily accessible thanks to the

159
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,230
vulnerability

160
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,230
and obviously the detection of the

161
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,800
vulnerability must go to inform

162
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,600
the organization who receives the

163
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,660
report here is why I

164
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,520
said  the legal aspect inna  First of all,

165
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,920


166
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,810
a person who contacts the

167
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,610
organization reporting a

168
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,350
vulnerability should not be treated as an attacker, therefore using the

169
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,140
disclosure policy is in fact

170
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,420
giving us support it is not a person who

171
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,000
attacked us and therefore created damage

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,860
to our organization

173
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,590
obviously  must take action for the analysis

174
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,100
and verification of what has been reported

175
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,490
resolve the vulnerability in a time that is also quite

176
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,930
appropriate

177
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,780
and then go and

178
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,050
notify it activate initiatives such as bug

179
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,830
bounty or you

180
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,970
do it with regard to the public

181
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:46,200
administration in 2017 if I'm not mistaken 18

182
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,270
we have organized a connected caton

183
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,610
to the project of developers ita cuts

184
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:59,070
where anyone could go to

185
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,510
collaborate with the public

186
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,100
administration bringing their own

187
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,880
contribution

188
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,420
therefore the public administration

189
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,900
if it wanted to marry initiatives that

190
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,330
aim at greater security of

191
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,070
its systems, for example, it could

192
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,440
also activate some bug initiatives.

193
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,850
even outside of the

194
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,290
responses to the faces exploded

195
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:28,080
respawn initiative sebold conspicuous and policy the

196
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,330
public administration obviously can

197
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,470
benefit in implementing an air dpa

198
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,140
parte ok

199
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,790
obviously understands the importance of

200
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,250
safety the ct of your

201
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,370
organization

202
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:49,160
today also thanks to the algidi

203
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,460
all plan  'within the public

204
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,050
administration and there is greater

205
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,170
attention to what is the fact that the

206
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,550
exposed data services are managed but because

207
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,490
it is seen above all as a

208
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,610
problem that then exposes the public

209
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,520
administration often itself therefore the

210
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,610
management to problems with the guarantor

211
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,140
himself

212
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,140
but let's say  this is also a way to

213
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,130
bring the public administration closer to the

214
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,170
importance of the security issue by

215
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,200
not seeing the responsible disclosure

216
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,970
policy as a risky initiative

217
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,690
or the responsive disk on policy

218
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,210
is not in fact an invitation to be

219
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,830
attacked and simply a modality

220
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,560
with which

221
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,900
the intention

222
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,660
is manifested is therefore the il proce  sso through

223
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,660
which we say you can cooperate with

224
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,480
the organization itself know well in

225
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,880
its services ct is those to be included

226
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,500
in the policy or a public

227
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,490
administration of the policy

228
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,930
those that are the

229
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,910
most important assets are identified and therefore put

230
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,110
under it is of  p obviously to do

231
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,450
this there is the need to know

232
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,900
well which are the connections of

233
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,130
their services as they are exposed most

234
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,930
likely there will be a

235
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,050
supplier behind them that supports them but in

236
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,050
any case the organization itself must

237
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,810
obviously know and therefore know

238
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,320
what to do in the  the moment in which

239
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,050
a vulnerability is notified of a vulnerability obviously it

240
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,880
is structured and organized to

241
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,910
respond to reports

242
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,230
currently in the public

243
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,410
administration there is no figure of

244
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,150
chief information security officer

245
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,519
but there are figures who

246
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,670
in fact perform this

247
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,629
task

248
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:06,470
here is the public administration  today

249
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,290
however at a one a comple  also an

250
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,949
organization that is part of the cert dark

251
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:18,050
sirte is from a series of organizations

252
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,199
that revolve around the theme

253
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,790
of information security that

254
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,800
can certainly give support

255
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,810
when you are faced with

256
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,009
solving a security problem

257
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:36,920
some Italian examples of application

258
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,550
of the responsable visa policy

259
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,310
team and fastweb which are two of the

260
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,970
main companies in the field

261
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,540
of communications

262
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,600
last but not least own spa which is in

263
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,889
fact the public company because in

264
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:05,329
fact, despite being private, it is a

265
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:08,209
public company behind the app

266
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:12,139
at start-up or the app for the

267
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,720
provision of public

268
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,220
administration services

269
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,579
they have implemented responsible

270
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:22,750
security policy where they actually go to

271
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,980
highlight you know what the steps

272
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,610
to take are and the times in which you can

273
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,279
go yes it seems to solve the

274
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,630
problem itself

275
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,350
I finished let's say the short

276
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,080
presentation because in fact it had

277
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,510
about a vent  In a few minutes, however,

278
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,290
here is what I wanted which wanted to

279
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,380
highlight the opportunity that

280
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,150
the public administration has today to

281
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,220
marry initiatives of proximity

282
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,490
between security experts and communities

283
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,870
in the field of security

284
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,080
we not in the field of security for

285
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,830
example but for example in this

286
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,930
when there will be the covip

287
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,750
we have greatly benefited from the relationship

288
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,560
with experts and communities in the

289
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,390
data field in this case we have

290
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,870
dealt with the rogation of the data

291
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,190
and information of the copit 19

292
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,830
at a national level and the

293
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,180
relationship with all these

294
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,020
experts  of data has given us a strong

295
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,250
impulse in going to

296
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,800
operate correctly so the same

297
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,230
thing we hope to achieve in the field of

298
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,720
security just so implementation

299
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,910
of a rdb thank you very much thank you very much

300
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,440
umberto remember if anyone has any

301
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,990
questions can connection kate have as well

302
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,620
remove youth in videoconference or

303
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,750
via group such g even tweets

304
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,770
in between  Time to ask them a question I

305
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,270
am perhaps even more than ready let's

306
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,980
start with one that concerns

307
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,680
the relationship of the public

308
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,430
administration in particular

309
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,140
of the central administration with the

310
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,170
community of developers and then at

311
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,420
this point I will ask you to briefly illustrate the

312
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,200
initiative at a per site

313
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,300
level  of which you also mentioned in short,

314
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,040
yes then I at this moment, as

315
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,930
said, I work at the always in the presence

316
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,790
of the Council of Ministers but in

317
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:59,040
civil protection when the project of

318
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,880
developers developers Italy started I was in the

319
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,109
agency for digital Italy where

320
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,480
among the  various things precisely in those in

321
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,809
that period of taken the

322
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:18,089
technical guide of the speed project the

323
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,500
speed project which was

324
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,290
one of the first projects included

325
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,020
within this

326
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,280
community

327
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,820
what is developers italia developers

328
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,860
italia is precisely the  tool that

329
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,400
brings

330
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,040
the world of business communities closer

331
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,130
to anyone who develops for the pub  blica

332
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,530
administration or could develop

333
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,690
for the public administration with the

334
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,060
public administration itself is a

335
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,810
point where you go to share how the

336
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,680
same cad in fact

337
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,680
requires everything that is developed

338
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,230
in the public administration and

339
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,030
is a large index of repositories because

340
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,160
then as repositories they are  in fact

341
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,120
used the tabs rather than club and

342
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,270
others and others and so the other services and

343
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,580
repositories where therefore there are

344
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,400
libraries xvi that the documentation

345
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:30,590
code examples test environments to go to

346
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,110
implement what are the

347
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:36,480
so-called enabling platforms

348
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,350
this starting then  they want to become

349
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,280
speed in the service of my municipality or

350
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,540
use pago p classroom c is or npr all

351
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,640
the code that is developed

352
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,950
is released and notified on the

353
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:58,200
developers italia in 2018

354
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,020
I remember a

355
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,470
big h was organized with various offices

356
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,720
throughout Italy  where in fact the communities

357
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,880
have participated in a very

358
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,850
stopping way  initial to the development of components

359
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,260
and also a way

360
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,130
for developers but also

361
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,160
security experts in fact because obviously vulnerabilities in

362
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,100
a software can hide

363
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,890
vulnerabilities even in quotation marks

364
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,290
to show off and cooperate

365
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,630
so let's say it is a platform

366
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,870
that aims to put in communication the

367
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,480
technicians of the public administrations

368
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,570
with the technicians and experts of the

369
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:54,610
communities and private individuals in short, well,

370
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,830
not girls for this in-depth analysis

371
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,280
another question bar 90 concerns the

372
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,410
connection of the work you do

373
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,870
now civil protection with the communities

374
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,990
of those who deal with data  open data

375
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:14,500
or perlata and materially we released

376
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:20,290
every day the particular datasets

377
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:25,470
on qooid there was on the

378
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:29,620
updated situation practically new the

379
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,540
situation of new people are

380
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,190
infected super etc.

381
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,510
and this thing I saw that at the beginning

382
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,950
it was a little ignored by  newspapers then

383
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,290
became more and more important then

384
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,910
became pro  first a fundamental thing

385
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,890
then I reflect this to this role and

386
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,370
that you had very important you

387
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,380
have been aware right away

388
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,470
or you have somehow

389
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,810
realized along the way also the

390
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,230
greater use of the newspapers of

391
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,150
people who served as a shield

392
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,580
so some point  there were always these

393
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,830
to assure more and more then the

394
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,630
theme was this obviously it was necessary to

395
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:21,190
inform the citizens of what

396
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,220
was of what was the evolution of a

397
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,150
phenomenon that until now we say was was

398
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,250
unique there had never been

399
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,880
no  it had never happened with let's say with

400
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,790
this however interest so the

401
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,950
citizenship required information

402
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,750
so much that the president of the council

403
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,820
asked our head of

404
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,900
department every evening in parma.

405
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,410


406
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:59,920


407
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,700
who could then report the

408
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,890
information through their

409
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,420
articles then also thanks to the push of

410
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,240
organizations such as commanded data ninja

411
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,890
or single or single data experts

412
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,360
the idea was to try to

413
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,340
make school quotes to start a

414
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,220
new a new way of delivering

415
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,800
data for the public administration which

416
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,310
was not to release only pdfs but

417
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,960
data in a

418
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,380
structured way that could then be

419
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,040
easily ingested by

420
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,710
dashboard representations analysis studies

421
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,880
and anything else you

422
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,940
see this is a bit what because in

423
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,920
fact we are trying to do with the

424
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,160
manager of stasio inches

425
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,830
there is always the need to leave  from a

426
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,740
project in this, for example, there is the

427
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,770
strength of the first project which is that

428
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,170
it has married it, not that it has been implemented,

429
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,180
therefore as the public

430
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,740
administrations begin to use

431
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:17,800
certain mechanisms, then they become

432
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,430
an initiative of the public

433
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,050
administration.  at least unfortunately it works for us

434
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,180
it works so it

435
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,380
is a slow process but then you get there

436
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,140
and so the contact is very important  i between

437
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,690
the communities and the public

438
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,670
administration itself obviously we

439
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,470
had thought about the method of

440
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:42,870
providing the data I providing

441
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,590
from the experience made in ajith

442
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,980
digital costs related developers italy

443
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,580
obviously use

444
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,200
I already know well said form the

445
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,820
tab platform so

446
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,940
we decided to release  the data is not in a

447
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,480
format to download from the site anything else

448
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,120
but put on a process that

449
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,970
then to our great pleasure we say

450
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:13,770
was seen by newspapers as a

451
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,080
use case to start developing

452
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,540
within the public

453
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,720
administration  It is very important for

454
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,620
us in the public administration to

455
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,330
participate in this kind of events

456
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,910
because in fact here we come into contact

457
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,690
with a whole series of experts who

458
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,040
maybe want to make ideas and

459
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,600
so on but maybe never manage to

460
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,910
understand who to come into contact with  or

461
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,860
maybe it is we who are unable to make people

462
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,620
understand the initiatives we do that

463
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,210
we do internally q  so

464
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,950
first of all I thank

465
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,280
you thank you for the invitation and

466
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,630
obviously I invite anyone to let's say to get

467
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,580
in touch when he

468
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,860
wants to collaborate or wants to report

469
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,170
any vulnerabilities that he

470
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,679
finds

471
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:11,830
thanks one last thing concerns a little

472
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,039
rite for this staff in essence you

473
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,220
the administration said at the meeting

474
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,940
I wanted to understand how you got to the

475
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,159
organization if from the beginning or you

476
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,990
talked about the digital film so

477
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,460
if you were not in the public

478
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,619
administration before and you arrived thanks to

479
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:35,320
the digital team then I worked the

480
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,269
first ten years of my life in

481
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:42,240
IT company also large

482
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,909
and then at a certain point to

483
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:50,350
marry the project of a small

484
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,590
company of Teramo that was the

485
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,629
time of the first tomtoms to

486
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:58,179
be clear that I was working precisely in the

487
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:01,749
field of satellite systems

488
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:06,490
those had slipped that that desire

489
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,830
let's say  to work with

490
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,619
satellite geographic data and thus

491
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:12,789
abandon a large  de company to

492
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:14,889
go to work in a small and

493
00:26:14,889 --> 00:26:17,940
therefore made by much faster growth

494
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,169


495
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:23,369
after which I participated in a competition

496
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:27,629
for the chamber of commerce of Teramo

497
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:31,470
where I dealt

498
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,700
with computer science then I managed all the

499
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,270
computer part of the institution after

500
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:43,230
what happened I participated

501
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:49,380
in hack aton in 2015 in 2015 or

502
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,250
participated in albi albi gap which was

503
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,909
held in rome and I won the section

504
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:59,640
relating precisely to open data data

505
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,850
which was sponsored by the presidency

506
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,590
council of ministers also in

507
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,520
particular after having  won this one

508
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,740
of the executives who was there at the

509
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,809
award ceremony obviously wanted to

510
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:15,870
know the team well we were three

511
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:19,320
people in fact who participated

512
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,960
that we had won and when he learned that he

513
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,460
worked in a public administration

514
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,460
he proposed me what is called the

515
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,929
command  the command is a way to

516
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:29,970
move the employees of the public

517
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,039
administration from one body to another

518
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:35,370
here this was in fact my  o I

519
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,429
arrive in Rome I'm from Abruzzo

520
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:40,890
so thanks to a caton I

521
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,600
found myself working in the presidency of the

522
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,390
council so let's say I arrived

523
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:52,140
in a certain environment thanks to

524
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,750
a cooperate in proposing an initiative

525
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,210
at that time as a private person obviously

526
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,940
participated in the ca  with and I arrived

527
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,460
from the public administration then and

528
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,409
courage instead it was also the whole

529
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:09,090
period of the Piacenza digital team and then

530
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,770
of deeds as it was a moment that

531
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,960
those who changed things a lot

532
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,710
were really useful I say it as

533
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,600
an internal person who participated

534
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,940
let's say to this at this historical moment

535
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,260


536
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,270
from today I am at the

537
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:30,390
civil protection department where I try to pull

538
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,750
the best is and innovate soon among

539
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,110
other things I tell you that there will be

540
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,230
some quite important initiatives and

541
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,390
maybe next year we will talk

542
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:46,320
more extensively  well then I would have if

543
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,140
there is space for a minute for a quick answer

544
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,960
in a question that came to us from the

545
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,549
personal are  following and in

546
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:55,830
particular david believes in it if one does

547
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:00,030
exposed the disclosure manager but then

548
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,500
nothing happens

549
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,909
we say that the administration

550
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,289
pretends not to feel how it should

551
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:08,340
move I have to answer the public

552
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,419
administration must answer from

553
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:16,140
your friend to this question that we

554
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,899
arrive of the public ss a public

555
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:23,250
administration adopts the method of the

556
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,210
caspian symbol disco su poli you must in

557
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:31,440
fact feel the subject who is

558
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,159
notifying a certain vulnerability

559
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,990
so I would like to say that if he has

560
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,780
implemented this initiative

561
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,539
this methodology

562
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:44,929
within the  administration is mathematical that

563
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:47,730
any notification is heard

564
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,309
obviously here we say then obviously

565
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:52,890
there are times within which the

566
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,169
public administration must

567
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:58,020
correct the vulnerability because

568
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,970
if we then want to talk about the white and

569
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,440
black cat issue in

570
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,500
a good time we can report the

571
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,960
vulnerability is not  corrected comes

572
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,660
a white hat unfortunately vulnerability  then

573
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,420
it is not notified and is

574
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:15,630
simply used ex and black

575
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,360
thanks for this time final answer

576
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,490
we have reached the end I can not

577
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,460
help but dep again
