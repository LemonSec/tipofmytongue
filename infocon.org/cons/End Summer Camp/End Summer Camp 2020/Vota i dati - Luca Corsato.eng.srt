1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,939
so i'm against luca corsato by

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,660
profession i'm data manager it's the

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,220
first time i came to led summer

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,910
camp it was in 2012 that i

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,790
presented a first idea of what

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,289
could be open data

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,690
excuse me luca you have a

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,430
screen sharing  you are showing the

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,859
slides by chance it has nothing to

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,320
do thanks sorry if not my ugly

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,260
face nothing after which I returned with

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,880
the legendary beck but it seems to me that there

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,110
is also this year to present

14
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:40,010
weight at the time two years ago in  three years ago

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,180
facebook tracking and expose schools and to

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,219
which we had taken care of precisely by

17
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,240
project manager

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,410
and then now it does not remind me of last year

19
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,660
I came for the open business

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,640
model of data and this year since

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,390
we are in the electoral period

22
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,150
I have  permission to draw up on behalf

23
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,530
of the data what could be a

24
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,480
sort of program

25
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,300
because looking at at least here in Venice

26
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,740
what were the various

27
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,590
electoral programs of things on data on

28
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,340
technology  ogia

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,439
coming total inaction so I

30
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,719
would make mine the classic of

31
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,850
political assemblies that I do not know if anyone has

32
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,770
had the luck the misfortune to

33
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,530
participate I would say that I hint at

34
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,000
what could be the

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,299
political statement after which debate

36
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,070
then follows dear

37
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,290
citizens and with citizens you are  people

38
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,290
we are not the data that speak we are

39
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,060
given verb and no but the past participle

40
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,640
of giving the proper name of elements of

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,190
information made of symbols numbers

42
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,950
and letters that must be worked

43
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,380
here we are data present in our

44
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,430
analog and digital lives a  propose yourself

45
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,430
for your analytical thinking

46
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,930
we ask for the push that of the artist

47
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,550
who is there to represent the

48
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,990
abstract sense with colors and shapes

49
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,270
we are available to represent

50
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,150
what you perceive we data are casio

51
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,270
nal collected aggregates recited

52
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,690
accessible automated the

53
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,670
more our organization is

54
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,650
automate the more we rely on

55
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,810
your human nature to you

56
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,610
integrity that is not fascinated by

57
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,560
machines we rely on your

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,010
habits

59
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,470
we data we have no prejudices you

60
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,120
instead are made up of points of view and

61
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,560
distraction

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,900
the media owners are mathematicians and

63
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,360
scientific experts who see you

64
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,850
as our producers

65
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,730
behind the timeline the apps for  these

66
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,340
digital shamans you are to be transformed the

67
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,410
lists for advertisers you defend yourself

68
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,740
with privacy cyber security often

69
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,300
algorithms sensitive to our

70
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,020
knowledge when you feel exploited you

71
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,000
perceive the pickpocketing of what you

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,760
know without knowing what you write

73
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,830
how many times your tastes your

74
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,170
habits become data for others

75
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,980
then  vote for us and use ask us

76
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,950
access and perfect skills I also see the

77
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,710
time we data are not exclusive to

78
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,930
specialists and this is important we

79
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,040
are not reserved

80
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,010
we want to be like the words we humans

81
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,170
went to make him write letters

82
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,080
for your loved ones from the scribes those

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,370
letters minino  read to others who do not

84
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,670
knew how to decipher those symbols

85
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,170
you were illiterate as you are

86
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,270
today data

87
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,280
are also illiterate returning who

88
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,720
know the words do not understand the

89
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,820
meaning an advantage for

90
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,320
technology scenarios that exploit

91
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,700
data illiterate you

92
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,530
and yet we are among you with tools that

93
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,170
we did not have before

94
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,230
vote us to give us meaning vote

95
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,300
us to use us in the archives to have us

96
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,520
describe realities that you suspect but you

97
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,950
cannot prove you are artists of

98
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,930
reality we given to see we must

99
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,490
be seen

100
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,130
smoking have made great speeches to

101
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,920
overcome social and economic limits

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,080
we are your escape from the car

103
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,570
we offer  the emancipation

104
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,730
of the assembly line because we

105
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,180
already live in it

106
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,668
you do not have to live in the

107
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:17,720
assembly line

108
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,310
what should democracy offer

109
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,410
compared to dictatorship if not

110
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,990
freedom from static and repetitive work

111
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,750
we, given, live and reproduce

112
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,350
in constant and obsessive observation

113
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,330
we are in the roset stone  in the fabric

114
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,759
of the frame in the mechanical computer

115
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,400
in and workers in your smartphones

116
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,440
we are there regardless of your will

117
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,020
but we endow ourselves with dissent with your

118
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,000
initiative

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,310
the industry wants to know without applying

120
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,080
rather it wants you to know without

121
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,570
applying their product is consumer knowledge

122
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,560


123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,150
as teen movies we want to know

124
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,850
everything but we give them the opportunity to

125
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,400
choose what and how much to know we are from

126
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,080
this point of view horizontal and

127
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,419
vertical horizontal to know

128
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,870
a little bit of everything and vertical to know

129
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,389
a little bit down into the depths or up towards the

130
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,150
stars  one we see knowledge but

131
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,470
direction

132
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,050
you humans choose where to go how and at

133
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:16,800
what speed

134
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,570
we fuel our judgment

135
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,240
we want to be brief but because we are

136
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,539
rough and ignorant we are objects

137
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,449
for your information we can give

138
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:29,580
reasons for your prejudices can give

139
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,070
boost your theories we do not judge

140
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,440
you  Liberian from the dictatorship of

141
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,169
opinions vote for us to give substance to

142
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,930
your opinion in exchange we ask you for

143
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,849
the commitment the beauty the thought

144
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:50,110
the press release now of the debate ok

145
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,839
let's talk then I would not start

146
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,089
a chat that part of your

147
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,569
experience with data in the sense that in the

148
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:00,849
end this house is a  a bit of a

149
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:04,959
provocation also let's call it a

150
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,749
political background and it is a bit borderline compared to

151
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:11,289
what are the mice lines that the

152
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:14,610
east stop as you consider a

153
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,300
political topic

154
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,699
and simply for a matter of

155
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:23,319
preferences and choices but this is this

156
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,559
statement that you have surely made

157
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,939
based on your experience so if

158
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:30,939
you want to tell us specifically that it

159
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:34,679
could be political in the sense that the

160
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,570
data

161
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,220
strongly affect what are

162
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,360
the political interpretations

163
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,110
after which I believe that to be trained and

164
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,939
enabled to process the data

165
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:50,159
above all to be able to directly access

166
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,740
the sources of  a more or

167
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,830
less automatic way based on the competences

168
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,040
is a civil civic law

169
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,120
because how  there are libraries there

170
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,820
must also be data available and

171
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,630
I took the liberty of doing this

172
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,630
gypsy because the chaos we

173
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,680
witnessed both for a bit of ignorance and

174
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,710
also for some cases

175
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,600
exploiting the chaos and the info of

176
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,880
mine as it was  defined for the speech

177
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,590
to the co lead has generated confusion if we

178
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,250
some cases chaos and fear

179
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,670
so I believe that requesting

180
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,930
in the field of electoral proposal but it is valid

181
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,560
for any political component a

182
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,650
choice of civil just all the

183
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,050
effects that there is consideration is

184
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,080
a guarantee that in the

185
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,440
let's say administration platforms is integrated

186
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,950
not as it was done that I know up to 56 years

187
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,410
ago or that at the beginning with open data

188
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,990
that data must be open data

189
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,490
must be available

190
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,890
then on licenses and what

191
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,560
can be done eh yes it is and yes

192
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,970
also verify the costs because

193
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,590
obviously producing or releasing the data

194
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,420
have costs,

195
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,410
however if you begin to ask that the

196
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,320
data be entered as par

197
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,650


198
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,790
In this case, it is an integral part of administrative and political choices,

199
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,169


200
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,929
so I am perfectly aware

201
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,990
that rightly lesc should not take

202
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,460
positions or acquire political instances

203
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,460
but

204
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,370
it was taught and taught to

205
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,459
hold the pen when you are small and as

206
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,130
a  somehow the former ability to the whole

207
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,649
series of technologies there also had to

208
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:57,779
be a reception on the part of those who

209
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,890
propose to administer

210
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,440
an acknowledgment that we must respond

211
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,570
to certain requests that is not

212
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,360
only straight away the date in the face

213
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,070
but I will make it available to you according to

214
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,410
what your requests are or in

215
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,459
your segments of interest

216
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:17,379
this was just to clarify that

217
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:22,929
it is not a stance towards one

218
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,819
party with respect to the other a candidate

219
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:27,009
with respect to the other because I must say that

220
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,170
from  this point of view the offer is

221
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,459
very low

222
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:33,639
the particular case is that very often

223
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,629
the data are confused with the documents and

224
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:38,889
therefore do not r  iesce to distinguish

225
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:41,019
those who are the two different natures

226
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:45,610
of things must speak of

227
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,059
this very generic and

228
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:51,730
general statement but clearly then in this

229
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,279
provision you are doing them is also given

230
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,529
some references a little more concrete has in

231
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,519
mind in particular the invitations to me

232
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,149
then  I had a very

233
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:08,550
interesting and formative experience and let's say also

234
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,399
proving that I was neither among the creators

235
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,439
of the organizing committee of the

236
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:16,480
ideas pavilion nor the

237
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,679
architecture biennial two years ago and what

238
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,480
did the facts have to do

239
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,329
with the snow was that of  to say

240
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:27,639
how to do architecture

241
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,799
with buildings there is also an

242
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,369
information architecture for which

243
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:35,829
one of the instances that I would ask in one's

244
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:37,899
own cities is not so much going to

245
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,179
ask the municipality that will make

246
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:43,449
data available or or to whom for it but and

247
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:46,329
there are  integration between the data of the

248
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:48,339
single instances I make the case of

249
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,769
Venice to me to have the data of the municipality is

250
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:52,749
enough not interested I also want  the

251
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,899
data of the archives of the faculties of the

252
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,660
archives of the ior of ca foscari

253
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,019
of the state

254
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,920
archive the archive of the biennale

255
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,830
there are a myriad of archives

256
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,830
whose greatest limit is that they cannot

257
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,740
talk to each other and if we see the

258
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,830
look town it has  these limits

259
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,260
have been highlighted that many companies have had difficulty

260
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,790
in being able to activate sma policies

261
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,120
of smart working choices because

262
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,680
people simply could

263
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,560
not access the data that was sealed

264
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,010
in their computers and then the race was made

265
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,080
to the various suppliers.  I have

266
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,820
not even seen with the school in the case of my

267
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,870
daughter that there is no problem if you

268
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,450
turn to microsoft or google or what else

269
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,330
the problem is that if there is no choice it

270
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,390
is a data management policy

271
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,770
that only goes  from you I put them

272
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,450
available material I organize

273
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,640
the point of view found a paper

274
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,660
in fact also translated on nexus done

275
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,900
by the network data

276
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,270
section the section indeed the open access section

277
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,730
of matthews c  he spoke of the concept of

278
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,830
trust

279
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,780
if you go to the site on which I write

280
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,140
my nonsense which is called data porn

281
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,440
you find it treats in essence it acts not

282
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,990
so much not only on the data but acts

283
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,060
directly on the repositories there is on the

284
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,630
archives

285
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,870
and a concrete example of that  what is the

286
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,210
right way of how to manage them

287
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,570
just go to articulation point org that I

288
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,990
don't know how many know it but it is spectacular

289
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,150
in my opinion it is the second largest retired

290
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,370
after the internet and the

291
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,550
particular thing is that if a node has been and

292
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,920
still holds  made available by the

293
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,370


294
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,100
cern from here it was in fact known it is an

295
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,810
even permanent archiving system

296
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,130
that is used internally

297
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,180
indeed it was born as an internal repository of the

298
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,360
cern for what concerned the data

299
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,630
produced by the various colliders and by the

300
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,820
data exchanged by the various researchers  but

301
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,860
not only did they also have another need

302
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,250
and researchers the need to fix

303
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,880
them permanently over time and then

304
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,510
associate them with particular types

305
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,420
of metadata

306
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,019
that are called doi

307
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,089
stands for digital object the teeth fi

308
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:35,399
and this allowed not only to put

309
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,879
a sort of stamp stamp it is as

310
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,459
we say it was like when I don't know who

311
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,800
has had experience of playing when

312
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,110
playing sti mandarà and composing the

313
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,819
song was sent to us cell was

314
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:50,100
recorded on a box there will be

315
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,709
sent to me as registered when you did not

316
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,240
have the possibility to register to

317
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,360
siae genio through this doi gives the

318
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,949
possibility to imagine a sort of

319
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:01,860
registered letter which is cool and that however

320
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,240
this is also a weapon  link that remains

321
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,620
fixed over time

322
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,020
because it is guaranteed to be

323
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,190
permanently stored so I

324
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,870
recommend everyone to go to node 2

325
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,870
especially since it has become famous because

326
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,800
the giannotti with ilaria capua the year

327
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,700
the year disclosed precisely as an

328
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,280
open access repository for the code and

329
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,740
I had started looking at it when it

330
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,550
was in mid-March that there were already 4 thousand

331
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,640
and passes records that went from paper to

332
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,560
even  applications just to

333
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,910
read interpret the data

334
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,160
now I think they are 500 thousand that is and they

335
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,560
are all the materials released with

336
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,610
open licenses

337
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,340
the beautiful thing elise nord and that is not

338
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:55,660
squeamish as

339
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,830
regards the licenses one can also

340
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,080
put them with all the second licenses

341
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,760
all rights reserved or

342
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,520
even put it in private is a graduate and

343
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,790
even linkable with kitab so

344
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,150
I can treat the codes it has aroused as if it were a scientific paper

345
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,950


346
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,870
because they are connected so this is a

347
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,660
practical example here is the idea it could

348
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,830
be that they are wondering

349
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,760
about  integrated data management policies

350
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,590
in their cities in which

351
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,020
the various data holders are integrated

352
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,890
ok so it was that is as an example it is

353
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,600
very clear

354
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,630
well then I would say that if there are

355
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,180
people who want to ask questions or here

356
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,359
from the room or obviously from the

357
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,310
possibility of  interact with the

358
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,090
internal lance of this substance obviously from the

359
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:57,100
lace of the graham portal possi  I love to ask you

360
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,400
to write them and in the meantime I

361
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,530
repeat this point a question

362
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,580
but I have talked about the data and

363
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,430
somehow in this part said work but

364
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:13,500
I wanted to ask you how you got to

365
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,790
deal with data therefore at the

366
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,440
level of the current history of

367
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,090
European quantity and  how come here

368
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,670
then I started to

369
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,420
deal with data around 2006 2007

370
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,580
mainly open data

371
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,190
because at the time I was a painter and in

372
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,680
addition I was also a DJ that is instead of

373
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,980
mixing the music they mix the images and

374
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,180
I needed

375
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,250
I could not find high definition images so I

376
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,770
started looking for some archives that

377
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,420
could be available I

378
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,320
found in 2008 2009 internet archive

379
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,560
I discovered wikimedia commons

380
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,860
I have all the various other deposits there and

381
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,980
then started precisely from the plus to

382
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,990
an old toshiba  then it was broken and

383
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,060
therefore I could not make us

384
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,560
still run windows installed first linux

385
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,079
ubuntu then deviate and then as I wanted

386
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,069
and  ssere the subdued purist arc linux and

387
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,690
did my thing he started from

388
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,940
that after which since in the meantime he

389
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,740
was still an employee of the municipality of

390
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,400
venice in 2012 we founded open

391
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,589
data in venice to release the data of the

392
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,230
municipality and from there he then started  spaghetti

393
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,410
open data various things then for five years

394
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,180
he had a company that did data

395
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,560
management

396
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,360
enough so let's say that I have seen

397
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,970
very particular things lately I am

398
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,820
dealing with real estate data of agricultural data

399
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,450


400
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,280
I can say that on real estate data

401
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,130
the disaster the disaster and in particular

402
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,220
a  real estate data level

403
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,990
what can and can be done let's say that

404
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,460
at the real estate data level what

405
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,679
is not done in the sense that

406
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,410
one says who is the most

407
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,750
real estate data holder

408
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,130
is actually the biggest

409
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,520
real estate data holder are banks  and

410
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,450
the asset management companies

411
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,270
which have data relating to assets

412
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,390
that are around 300 billion

413
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,360
euros only for  Italy the problem

414
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,560
is that these data are

415
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,670
now beginning to

416
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,560
worry about passing them into

417
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,330
an acr system because they are still

418
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,630
documents for which he has the whole

419
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,910
property management system,

420
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,190
especially for the suburbs, which is

421
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,130
extremely backward  in fact, when I

422
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,410
talk about the management and integration of

423
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,370
data between multiple archives

424
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,500
or between multiple institutions, therefore a common

425
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,020
university, etc.

426
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,000


427
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,460


428
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,620


429
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,530


430
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,120
the data of

431
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,620
the real estate assets that very often

432
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,930
the same administrations or

433
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,000
private individuals who perhaps see the house that is

434
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,450
nice do not know who it has been closed

435
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,400
for years,

436
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,050


437
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:30,430


438
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:34,150
etc.  mobile valley passed inside a

439
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,280
bank the various folders have never been

440
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,040
digitized if they are the suburbs much

441
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,040
less e  so they remain there, there is this

442
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,450
heritage which in the end is very concrete

443
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,990
because we are talking about zalone houses and mentioning them

444
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,180
but we are talking about percentages on

445
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,480
the order of 15-20 percent of Italian cities

446
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,930
that do not know who those

447
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,700
properties that maybe are more  for years

448
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,600
we have been talking about private industrial houses

449
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,510
agricultural areas commercial women

450
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,510
and precisely due to the limitations of one

451
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:18,310
and the absence of interest I would say to do a

452
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,270
management and business model on the data

453
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,250
leads to neglect and a

454
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,160
simple fence for which I produce

455
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,260
data celio enough

456
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,270
the  it is important that we have them after

457
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,000
watching them manage them check them clean them

458
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,490
and let's say really put in

459
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,350
[Music]

460
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,870
the last of the priorities and in part

461
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,150
this we saw with the covip because

462
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,970
very often the data we worked on

463
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,080
were dirty they were not clean

464
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,679
and this has  generated false positives

465
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:57,940
of evaluation errors

466
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,159
and now that they are starting to

467
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,370
release the minutes of the city ds of

468
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,500
the scientific technical committee

469
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,950
let's say c  he from what you read it is

470
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,470
not necessarily

471
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,730
so-called data driven choices

472
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,190
here if we wanted to use a somewhat

473
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,990
technical term so I say out of passion and

474
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,639
curiosity I find myself doing this

475
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:23,500
profession but that a profession

476
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,840
that essentially has a very strange market

477
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,659
because here in Italy although we are

478
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:36,279
among the largest holders of archives and

479
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,289
also among the best archivists from this

480
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:39,789
point of view of theory among those who lived

481
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:42,070
catalogers also descriptors of

482
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,200
physical objects through data

483
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,139
this whole thing has no has no market

484
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:50,600
just see the offers  of data

485
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,039
management are generally

486
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:54,649
associated with professions that

487
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:57,910
concern mathematics physics

488
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,990
something about economics but engineering here is

489
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,970
management engineering something like that

490
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,530
but universities no no are not real

491
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,800
interlocutors because in fact among those who have

492
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,510
made the universities who is it who has been

493
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,800
prompted or advised by your

494
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,940
teacher to put the data

495
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,230
in the open archive a  ccess

496
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,770
of the

497
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,240
petrachi university of those present did a

498
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,390
university he lived maybe he never

499
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,790
knew that they existed by

500
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,770
law because they are disbursed by European funds

501
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,550


502
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,200
maybe some open access publications

503
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,630
which means that they are open disabled

504
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,400
unlike scientific pepper that

505
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,280
maybe to consult them  you have to spend 800

506
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,720
dollars

507
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,620
for a magazine and band

508
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,070
so it's all a heritage that is

509
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:54,840
still and in three minutes from so much

510
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,860
agricultural data you can know about it

511
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,870
seems a bit the antithesis noah real estate

512
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,660
agricultural the city the countryside never idea

513
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,970
then just in  three minutes at the

514
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,460
right time not to mention by chance I give you some

515
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,710
data then only 3 percent of

516
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,180
the Italian territory is represented

517
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,580
by the so-called big cities

518
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,190
all the rest is represented by

519
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,700
small cities even rural areas and

520
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,460
medium cities small cities and areas

521
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,280
rural areas represent 67 percent of

522
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,290
the Italian territory

523
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,720
so it means that it is this and these

524
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,090
proportions  i are more or less similar

525
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,179
even throughout Europe because Europe is about

526
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,820
62 63 percent of rural areas also

527
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,350
because a lot is brought

528
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:44,250
above all from Spain and France

529
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,460
therefore talking about agricultural data linked

530
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,140
to real estate data is closely

531
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,070
correlated because above all also with

532
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,820
the brawn

533
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,650
there has been an increase in the demand

534
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,130
for production and in the need for

535
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,669
fruit and vegetables km zero

536
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:04,570
and what happens so far the

537
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,190
fashion of precision agriculture

538
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,919
that makes sense on intensive production and

539
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:11,379
cultivation has led to the

540
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:13,590
creation of extremely

541
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,269
expensive devices that detected  a quantity of

542
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:17,799
data that takes away farmers did not give

543
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:20,200
a damn and above all there were

544
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,799
very serious creation problems that is

545
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,590
there was not on the market because rightly

546
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,600
every producer makes his own

547
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
interface his own management system

548
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,730
an integration that maybe or the sensor

549
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,330
of the  sebastiano's temperature and

550
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,299
luca's humidity sensor the two sensors

551
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:42,070
have two  entities between structures that do

552
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,409
not talk to each other and therefore I have two

553
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:45,970
completely separate managements I cannot

554
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,690
correlate them therefore the real estate

555
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,909
data given, sorry for agricultural data,

556
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:53,980
are used to help

557
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,779
farmers in the meantime to avoid

558
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:57,450
going around the fields continuously and

559
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,730
activate observation and monitoring tools

560
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,460
control of the supply chain

561
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,720
initially precisely to guarantee both

562
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,330
the producer and those who buy and

563
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,700
above all to share these data for

564
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,350
an arrow presenting the

565
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,200
productivity of the food needs

566
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,119
of a territory connected to

567
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,980
housing also allows you to be able to

568
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,309
redefine settlements or a

569
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:23,950
re-population of villages where  maybe they

570
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,480
are available because maybe they are

571
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,929
in fact inhabited for years some farms

572
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:30,909
or farms that we are also

573
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:33,070
only the whole area that is in the

574
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,109
jesolana also of the san donà area

575
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:36,070
where you are

576
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,350
there are many farms that

577
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,269
prevent more of which time  are closed and

578
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:41,980
may be active  you considering

579
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,720
that from the point of view of

580
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,000
European funds of tax relief

581
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,730
perhaps it is the most convenient thing that

582
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,320
can be done at the moment because

583
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,020
compared to the fearful tax relief

584
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,620
on agriculture so for those who

585
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,250
only want them available thank you very much for the

586
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,720
hour  thanks to the three for being

587
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,310
here with us sharing your

588
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,070
experience of aland summer camparada

589
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,230
2020 hello good

590
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,400
