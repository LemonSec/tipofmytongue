1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:06,490
ok so I'll talk quickly about

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,530
libreoffice 70 which is the latest version

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,389
that we announced in

4
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:16,720
August two or three days ago we

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,780
announced the 701 that the first never

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,620
release in the case of play off iss the mine

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,970
or liesel solve problems bagher and

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:34,210
grations that are quite normal

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,690
when a completely new software is announced

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,210


11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,379
does not go on to me because ok on with the

12
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,480
mouse and not with the keyboard but in

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,640
any case no problem then

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:56,869
I remember that 2020 we had to do and

15
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:58,960
we did it partially in the sense that

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,940
we succeeded  to talk remotely at

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,190
different events but it was a year in which

18
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,549
we tended to be present at a lot of

19
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:11,060
events because it is twenty years since sun

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,450
announced openoffice.org is

21
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,490
exactly 19 July 2000 and libreoffice is

22
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,130
the heir of openoffice anyway the

23
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,270


24
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,069
libreoffice community is the heir of the

25
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:27,470
open office community on September 28th so

26
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,979
not even in many days we

27
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:34,600
will announce the ten years of libreoffice

28
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,310
so we wanted  do a lot of face-to-face

29
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,399
activities we have done them

30
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,869
remotely we will probably be present more

31
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:48,379
or less with a similar theme next year

32
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,599
if it is possible everyone

33
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:53,720
wishes it but the latest news was that of a

34
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,580
few days ago and that the foster

35
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,539
will also be virtual  it is certainly the foster but it was

36
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:01,429
practically impossible to do in

37
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:03,470
presence in a situation like the

38
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,259
present one but it is certainly a bad

39
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,538
blow for the whole world I think because it is

40
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,209
the biggest worldwide event of

41
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:14,540
open software how many users in

42
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,379
libreoffice

43
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:17,180
this is a question that is asked

44
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,620
often we provide an estimate

45
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,370
an estimate that is based on the number of

46
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,830
percentages on the global number of

47
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,150
events I will summarize the

48
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,060
final result we practically believe that there

49
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,450
are about 250 million people

50
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,879
who have installed

51
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,090
libreoffice

52
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,579
we use the most conservative figure of

53
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:48,849
200 million  because surely there is

54
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:52,090
some duplication there is some person

55
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,310
who may have installed it and do not

56
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,470
use it  list or even use it as a

57
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,430
third choice

58
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,829
we believe that there are a hundred

59
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,959
million who use libreoffice as

60
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,720
their main solution and another

61
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,579
hundred use libreoffice

62
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,079
together with another solution

63
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:10,420
in most cases they are

64
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,940
online solutions so probably the

65
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,370
one that  it is flanked more by

66
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,190
libreoffice and google docs

67
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,500
also because it is clearly the only one among

68
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,260
those online that does not have a

69
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,819
desktop equivalent.Microsoft users clearly

70
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:30,819
use office 365

71
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,919
then there are other products that are

72
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,290
clones of microsoft office that have both

73
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,329
the desktop version  that the online version

74
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:37,959


75
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,000
however we say that we have about 200

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,590
million users

77
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,720
this is a community card so

78
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,389
it is not that they are the users but they are the

79
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:52,169
members of the community as you can see

80
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:55,959
we cover practically all continents

81
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,470
except Africa which in many cases has

82
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,389
problems well  other than those who

83
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,840
think of open source software,

84
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,480
however, we have seen negl  the last few months a

85
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,290
growth of interest also

86
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,139
from several users of several African users

87
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:15,609


88
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:17,889
the difference is the dark green we

89
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:19,599
have people who are members of

90
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,519
the open office community they

91
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,430
are members of the document foundation the

92
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,740
light green instead those are

93
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,599
the active communities but  where there are no

94
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,720
members I remember that you can become a

95
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,819
member of the foundation if you

96
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:36,090
contribute to libreoffice

97
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,069
it is not that by becoming a member you gain

98
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:40,610
something

99
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,819
we say that you have a voice a greater

100
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:46,699
say in the matter in the

101
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:49,009
moment in which there are elections when there are

102
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,099
are discussions we obviously

103
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:53,840
have mailing lists that are reserved for

104
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,689
members even if we are listening or

105
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:59,300
trying to hear in a

106
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,490
broader way even non-members because

107
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,319
we have a lot of people

108
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,879
contributing and they are not members

109
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,099
clearly we would like everyone

110
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:11,840
who contributes  actively and

111
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,039
continuously become members this

112
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:19,789
gives you some numbers all  now that

113
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:23,330
clearly these are even if

114
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:28,009
we write casual which means casual

115
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:31,520
we are talking about the group of people who are

116
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,150
active continuously

117
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,889
we have about seventy people who

118
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,389
are active daily about 180

119
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:44,389
who are active I would say on a more or less

120
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:49,129
weekly basis at most on a monthly basis and

121
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,940
about 700 who are active, let's say on

122
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,430
a quarterly basis, some of

123
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,360
these are active only on some

124
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,949
specific needs for example there are

125
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:03,050
security experts who

126
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,639
intervene only when we have

127
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,289
security problems

128
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:07,879
when we do not have

129
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,680
security problems therefore

130
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,860
open remote vulnerabilities  it is useless for

131
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,089
them to act on the libreoffice code and

132
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:21,560
obviously the

133
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,009
percentages are

134
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,259
completely different because 80

135
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,009
percent is done by those 70 active

136
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:32,099
on a daily basis 15 percent

137
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,659
from those who are active on a

138
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,689
weekly monthly basis  and 5 per cent from

139
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:39,270
those who are more sporadically active

140
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,169


141
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,680
I must say that I would like this not to

142
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,809
be interpreted as a

143
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:49,279
hierarchy of the importance they

144
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,779
are all important

145
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,119
we have people who made a contribution

146
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:57,210
that solved a vulnerability then

147
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,419
a single contribution a patch that however

148
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,809
allowed us to eliminate a

149
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:07,050
vulnerability clearly to know

150
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,969
the  the open source world knows very well

151
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:12,059
what we are talking about when we talk about the

152
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:15,539
contributions these are the contributions per

153
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,009
organization then

154
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:22,150
the red are the volunteers are about

155
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,520
28 percent

156
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,369
the rest is done by companies or

157
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:33,159
who are part of the

158
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,710
libreoffice system is that  they have developers who

159
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,169
pay developers to work on

160
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:40,360
the libreoffice code

161
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,909
this is important to understand because it is

162
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:47,680
exactly the model on which

163
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,330
the document foundation was created in

164
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,669
the libreoffice project i.e. we wanted

165
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,699
when we founded it we wanted to

166
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:58,120
avoid having a single company

167
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,849
behind the project  we wanted the

168
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:03,249
project to be the expression pi  ù of a

169
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,649
group of one-year companies of an

170
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:09,189
ecosystem of companies that each have

171
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,889
a niche, a particular

172
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:16,539
specific activity to devote to let's say that

173
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,069
over the years there has been a bit of

174
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:20,349
evolution so we have had

175
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:22,839
moments when this cake was  a little more

176
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,729
distributed at the time when it was more

177
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:29,649
concentrated but we would like the

178
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:32,078
current percentages not to

179
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,399
change significantly and indeed we would like to

180
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,318
increase the percentages or the number

181
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:41,740
of companies that contribute

182
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,740
smaller companies have contributions that

183
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,990
are below 3 percent so do not

184
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,850
I put them simply for the numbers then

185
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,089
they would not have seen each other munich for

186
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:54,279
example it is the municipality is the city

187
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:57,850
of munich that has hired developers

188
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,319
to work on libreoffice

189
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:02,970
so this is certainly an important aspect and

190
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:08,170
a contribution that we like

191
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:08,769
very much

192
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:10,839
we would like it as well  who

193
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,269
contributed and for example the

194
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:15,339
Italian defense ministry which

195
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,139
uses libreoffice but does not have

196
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,380
a  even a developer to

197
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,029
work on libreoffice is not the same

198
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,490
way we would like

199
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,100
those who contribute the French government that

200
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,980
uses libreoffice on about half a

201
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,770
million desktops but does not even have a

202
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,500
developer of course they occasionally

203
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,200
pay some fish but it would be very

204
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,690
nice if there was a contribution

205
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,510
continuous

206
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,580
these are the civil development

207
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,730
before 7 so we cleaned the

208
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,590
code then we did a

209
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,870
redone in the code then we

210
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,060
dedicated ourselves to the user interface

211
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,820
and then libreoffice 6 was the

212
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,380
moment we went to all

213
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,810
platforms so lubich  screw products tour

214
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,170
means that we are a bit on

215
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,960
all platforms in fact I tell you

216
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,480
what the versions are then the

217
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,050
desktop version of libreoffice is provided

218
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,550
by the doc as a foundation and

219
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,370
free open source software will never change

220
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,280
there was some controversy about 7

221
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,470
because we wanted  put names around

222
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,270
the product but we'll put them someone has

223
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,760
i  nterpreted in fact that it was called

224
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,750
personal or community as a

225
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,610
license change no the license does not change

226
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,510
so this remains free software free

227
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,750
open source software with license mpl

228
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,350
lgpl this is how it will be until

229
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,200
at least the founders are there

230
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,810
66 years I hope to get as far forward as

231
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,150
possible in age luckily from minds they

232
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,520
are founders who at the time of

233
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,010
birth there were 25 years old so

234
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,470
before you kill them,

235
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,860
at least half a century goes by,

236
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,320
then there are versions supporting them for a

237
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,200
long time  term the famous lts these

238
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,250
clearly we cannot produce them

239
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,860
generate us of the foundation because

240
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,820
we cannot give professional support

241
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,150
or rather we give professional support

242
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,320
martyr the support comes from us

243
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,800
volunteers to give support to a

244
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,140
real lts you need to have salaried people

245
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,210
so we have two companies that are

246
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,980
they call one collaborator and the other both the

247
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,670
biochips if you prefer that they produce

248
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,370
lts versions the on l version  ine it

249
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,980
is produced by both those of f then the sleep

250
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,340
foundation both collaborates that there

251
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,420
clearly the versions of collaborates the

252
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,960
chips are also their versions supported

253
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,850
the pdf version is supported by

254
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,400
volunteers

255
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,280
then we have an android version which is

256
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,200
called collaborate office but in reality it is

257
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,730
libreoffice and  we also have

258
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,270
versions for ipad so dio for ios and

259
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,360
versions for apple store then

260
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,760
versions for mac or them produced by

261
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,710
collaborates and versions for windows

262
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,290
store produced by both and eb so in

263
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,930
reality we are on

264
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,589
all platforms there is also recently one

265
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,480
version sorry I forgot

266
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,390
there is also recently a version for

267
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,660
chrome os that always comes is a

268
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,420
derivation of the android version

269
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,089
made by collaborate so there are all

270
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:43,690
these versions and not the versions

271
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,430
produced by collaborates and hedges have

272
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,350
different alignments in some cases  obviously they

273
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,990
are paid versions of the TS are

274
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,899
obviously paid version the other

275
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,899
versions have one of the different levels

276
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:00,910
let's say pid start from the

277
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,430
free version to get to supported versions

278
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,399
and therefore paid

279
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,640
in some cases those of the stores

280
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,100
are necessarily paid because

281
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,860
the stores in fact do not accept

282
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,570
free software but above all ask

283
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,080
for money and therefore to be able to keep

284
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,470
the software on  on the store

285
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,740
you have to actually pay also

286
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,900
because there is a development license that

287
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,480
costs a few thousand euros that must

288
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,200
be purchased and then

289
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,000
independently, i.e. on each version

290
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,150
sold, both apple and microsoft

291
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,140
hold a fairly significant slice of

292
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,150
the most important features of

293
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,980
libreoffice  7.0 then I would say that

294
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,500
the absolute most important functionality is

295
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,190
the support of edf 1.3 and the new

296
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,120
version of the standard format

297
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,900
in these days I would say the final vote is taking place

298
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,130
for the release of the

299
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,180
version of the

300
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,550
standard description of the standard which will then go to

301
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,420
iso for  the approval then there have

302
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,380
been the version been  approved in

303
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,990
December of last year

304
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:34,090
but it was then

305
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,830
later revised there were some

306
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,380
bugs because in any case we always talk about

307
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,410
a thousand pardi pages of text

308
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,480
and description so

309
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,470
the description of a standard

310
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,610
has been fixed a bit is terribly  it must be

311
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,620
terribly precise so the same

312
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,990
word must be used in these thousand

313
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,970
pages only in a context and with the

314
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,620
same meaning so you can

315
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,760
imagine when using adjectives

316
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,100
[Applause]

317
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,780
the almost maniacal attention

318
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,610
that must be used therefore vdf 1.3

319
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,100
supports  pgp encryption

320
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,840
recording of changes or

321
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,350
change tracking if you prefer

322
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,860
has been much improved the

323
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,150
description of the elements has been improved so

324
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,160
there were areas where these

325
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,440
descriptions were not very precise and

326
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,450
above all on geometric shapes on

327
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,610
some geometric shapes because then

328
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,250
you have to think that  all this all

329
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,770
that is written informed of

330
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:48,740
being 1.3 is actually xml so

331
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,840
it must match everything a tag

332
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,480
that must be unique and must be

333
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,490
clear and then several

334
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,130
bugs were fixed there was a bit of barber that were

335
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,230
in some cases terms used a

336
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,850
bit too much

337
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,880
like  to say casually

338
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,080
and precisely of the barbs that generated

339
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,550
malfunctions

340
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,360
then

341
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,340
the graphic engine that is now both was replaced on windows and with

342
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,490
the possibility of using the gpu

343
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,350
for acceleration it has become the

344
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,240
default solution on windows it can

345
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,350
also be activated on linux not  it is

346
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,940
exactly the activation is not

347
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,050
exactly user friendly this will happen

348
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,830
in the future for the moment none of the

349
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,760
previous graphics engines have been

350
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,240
deprecated however when schia

351
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,020
becomes absolutely stable some

352
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,050
things that date back to even

353
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,170
still openoffice will probably be

354
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,020
deprecated and as always it has improved

355
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,240
compatibility with ms off with microsoft

356
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,050
office with formats then unfortunately

357
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,959
being the forms  ati of office not being

358
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,439
standard and I can not tell you only it has

359
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,199
been aligned to version 1.3 as

360
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,630
in the case of edf so I have to tell you it has

361
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,490
been aligned to the latest versions of the

362
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,220
files what do you do you save file then one

363
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,830
will do reverse engineering look at how they

364
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,230
have been  made the latest versions and

365
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,980
tries to support things because

366
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,460
all half of the things that are in

367
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,840
the microsoft office files

368
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,300
despite being theoretically standard iso

369
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,950
are not documented or better maybe

370
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,200
let's say that maybe they are documented

371
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,430
somewhere but it is practically

372
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,500
impossible to find where  they are

373
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,780
documented

374
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,940
now I hope it starts on the next

375
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,400
slide there is a video that is a video that

376
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,210
was created by the community that makes you a

377
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,940
summary including those I

378
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,820
just told you about the news so

379
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,670
I hope it started first and then

380
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:19,830
ok it started  so in the meantime we have the

381
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,620
demonstration that libreoffice 7.01

382
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,219
works

383
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,340
the video you can also find it both on youtube

384
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,130
that will undergo tub

385
00:18:35,130 --> 00:19:03,900
[Music]

386
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,310
[Ap  applause]

387
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:22,230
[Music]

388
00:19:32,700 --> 00:20:23,690
[Music]

389
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,610
then I think the names have passed but

390
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,730
I think it is important to give the

391
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,549
credit

392
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:38,070
the credit for this video goes to 80

393
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,809
percent to the Indonesian community of

394
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:42,659
libreoffice all those music is

395
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,090
original music composed by a member

396
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,919
of the community  indonesian animations

397
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,769
are all done using trusts and

398
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:57,090
using other open source tools

399
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,129
by rania mina and some graphics

400
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:05,429
are done by another by another

401
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:10,320
member of the community this is a

402
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,669
summary if you want more things like

403
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:17,309
saying cutest singular gotta  to say

404
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,559
that I would like to know the user who

405
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:23,519
asked to be able to save a pdf of 5

406
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,249
square meters because I believe that at

407
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:29,129
least a handshake deserves it or

408
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:31,379
a touch of the elbow right now

409
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:34,259
because there is ke kazzo sorry for the term

410
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,720
but  what the [ __ ] are you doing with a pdf of 5

411
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,480
square meters but it's okay how to say

412
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,909
the users are always right so

413
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:46,210
you have to respond to their

414
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,379
needs

415
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:49,749
thank you find my

416
00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:52,659
email i think i was on time there is also

417
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:55,720
some time for questions if you want

418
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,999
if you have no questions

419
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:01,389
thank you for inviting me i just wanted to

420
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:03,849
say one thing the title of

421
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:06,519
honorary president was decided by the other

422
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,499
founders to save the money of the

423
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:11,789
bronze statue is because for which

424
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:15,039
practically they have said so to many

425
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,299
only now after which we then avoid

426
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:23,470
the other awards when sooner

427
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:29,409
or later it will leave well thanks Italy

428
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:33,070
so much about taming them I would have a me who

429
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,080
then a good interpretation of a

430
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,700
grenade discussion our group

431
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,159
such a serious one a while ago and that

432
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:43,330
takes a bit of a move that as a question

433
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,979
from that pie you showed with

434
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:46,239
the companies

435
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:50,559
behind it and there is no company that closes

436
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,690
for others there is certainly someone

437
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,570
from two others ago  however the idea was

438
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,249
to create this pool of companies according to

439
00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:00,909
what he explained to us and in our

440
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:03,220
telegram group a

441
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,289
fairly articulated discussion was born and it seems  of

442
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:10,570
about 150 200 messages concern

443
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,789
the relationship between foundations and

444
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:15,369
companies, saying that in some cases

445
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,739
companies strongly sponsor

446
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:21,159
some paolo zironi foundations that

447
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:24,239
deal with free software in a

448
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:27,940
way that can also guide

449
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,830
its development in some way.  to

450
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,929
have a control in the form of an

451
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:36,399
adviser for my extraction and so

452
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:36,700
on

453
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,950
so I wanted to know a moment about yours

454
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:45,190
on this topic and that it can be

455
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,499
said I absolutely will not be able to give

456
00:23:47,499 --> 00:23:49,770
absolutely then

457
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,000
at the moment in which they were

458
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,370
created the statute of  of the dog man

459
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,630
foundation it has been clearly written is

460
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,880
a rule on which some of the

461
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,240
founders are absolutely me I have

462
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,010
proposed it are of those that the proposal

463
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,620
and I am absolutely adamant

464
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,010
so as to say as long as I am alive they must

465
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:19,280
pass on my corpse is that in the  in the

466
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,870
inside of let's say gods bodies

467
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,960
that have decision-making power therefore the

468
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,330
board of director membership paragraphs  ttee

469
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:34,140
that what practically appoints and

470
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,230
renews the members the board is the one that

471
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,870
manages the administration

472
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,740
no no company can have more than a

473
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,980
third of the votes

474
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,270
if we assume that there is an election and they

475
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:55,100
are elected it happened last year

476
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,970
they were elected  three representatives of

477
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,900
collaborators the third in fact it is as if

478
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,240
he had never been elected

479
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,870
it is not that he was elected he had to say

480
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,870
renounce it

481
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,710
is a barrier therefore the third is not

482
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,470
elected and the third was the third in order

483
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,990
of voting is not that the  company can say

484
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,990
I decide which of the three to

485
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,020
eliminate you go right in order of

486
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,270
vote so

487
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,010
[Music]

488
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:35,160
exists then obviously exist but as

489
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,920
I believe it is obvious human and human

490
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,560
attempts to convince others to do

491
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,710
some things this is how to say it is part

492
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,520
of the games,

493
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,250
however, this rule

494
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,539
up to now and I believe also in the

495
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:57,619
future has absolutely saved us from an

496
00:25:57,619 --> 00:25:59,539
interference that could be too

497
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:05,720
strong clearly then there are characters

498
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,769
and companies that for the commitment c  he put

499
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:13,389
in the development in the management they

500
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:15,619
acquire a reputation within

501
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:17,269
the project which is particularly

502
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:22,220
important and there honestly I do not feel

503
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,080
like saying

504
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,120
that there must be a block

505
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,029
towards these companies

506
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:30,799
these companies obviously cannot

507
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,340
become the ones who decide to

508
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,629
however, if they

509
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,920
make 30 percent of the contributions, I believe that

510
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,750
they should be recognized and therefore there must

511
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:53,590
also be a management

512
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,330
that we define attentive to

513
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,570
the needs of these companies

514
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,850
then clearly careful does not mean

515
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,610
do everything you ask but it

516
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,980
means  if you have any requests that

517
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,620
are opportune requests

518
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,470
we take them into consideration and maybe we

519
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,510
approve them even if the requests are

520
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:22,570
inappropriate we are sorry, unfortunately

521
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,240
it is not that if companies have

522
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,750
dynamics that are very often different

523
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,940
from those of a community then it is

524
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,559
necessary to find a

525
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,220
meeting point we have managed to date

526
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,639
with some fat  ica because

527
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:42,070
clearly not always all things

528
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:45,940
come easily then how to say let's not

529
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,159
forget that around us we have

530
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,830
a competitive landscape that to names like

531
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:55,299
microsoft google and therefore it is not that

532
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,029
our role is common to all roses and

533
00:27:58,029 --> 00:27:59,100
flowers

534
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,710
in some cases we have to and then

535
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,669
let's remember apache openoffice was

536
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:08,379
created by the prosecutors to destroy

537
00:28:08,379 --> 00:28:11,039
libreoffice so it's not that we are

538
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,090
among loved ones at a corporate level

539
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,730
because precisely because we are an

540
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,620
independent and low community we reaffirm very

541
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,960
very often and in many cases we

542
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,200
strongly reaffirm it so

543
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,650
we say that it is not  one is certainly

544
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,460
an important and fundamental point

545
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,760
where a lot of efforts go to concentrate

546
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,070
that of balancing communities and

547
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,970
companies in the open source world

548
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,380
well then thanks for the answer and

549
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,480
above all thanks for being a week

550
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,530
for sharing this plate this

551
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,860
experience

552
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:00,280
thank you very much to all of you  and good evening
