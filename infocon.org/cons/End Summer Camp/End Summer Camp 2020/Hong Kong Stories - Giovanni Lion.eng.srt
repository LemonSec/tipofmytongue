1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,680
yes

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,180
so this is me already 15 have

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,679
foretold the origin a podium at heart

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,440
part of the group of bocconi della

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,939
growth mastiano in 2003 something

6
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:22,550
like this and lecce said you have to use

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,330
linux

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,920
we did in the election of linosa the

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,539
bocconians was the

10
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:36,170
forming experiences  the first hobbit who

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,060
not only associate something attentive 04 something 40

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,280
44 10 the first cd collection as well as

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,110
I would say it is not said even no that time

14
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,000
they practically gave themselves a

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,370
room inside the

16
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,760
reset institute and in the information systems and

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,470
tweaking in the evening  finding ourselves somehow

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,170


19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,640
we took the computers in the room

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,500
as a test computer we burned

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,810
a research expense of a researcher

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,920
the diet is written in the

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,210
researcher's brs then we recovered it and

24
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,340
he keys

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,420
the function of doing so well to do some other times

26
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:23,570
but I am  I have become perhaps more cautious

27
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,689
personally in growing up, however, I am

28
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:30,259
still quite freaked out after

29
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:33,619
the little mouth experience  s are worked for

30
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,950
selections in the jesi in milan for a few

31
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,859
years ago and give them and they do vertising

32
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:43,429
online from the other case but you have to

33
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:46,939
assume that cottage the year 2008 in

34
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,859
which it enters straight translated facebook into

35
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,859
italian it was the fault at the moment where

36
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:53,840
we make weight that  he left and the pious

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,749
and they teamed up to use also

38
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:01,249
why I told the boys there is this

39
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:05,209
fantastic tool all the customers of the

40
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,950
service in the sac offices

41
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,430
so yes they are really the bones with ruby

42
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,780
she likes facebook and however they have  had

43
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,629
the opportunity somehow in 2010 to

44
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,480
leave and come here kong while keeping

45
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,140
my job so after this jump

46
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,459
upsets in asia because anyway there

47
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,389
was during the diversity exchange it is

48
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,760
still an excellent choice

49
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,569
find a bit the community here I am with

50
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,579
bikes in person a liberating environment

51
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:42,299
is an important point of these ten

52
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:47,030
years I was my masters at the polytechnic

53
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,290
where in 2014 and the last masters game

54
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,370
and technology then videogames and has

55
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,549
all  to what comes from that stream

56
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:01,739
live set mates first meeting even

57
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,709
with the maker school makes me understand a lot

58
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,969
only software yes they are with my mind

59
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:11,040
always in the air but they gave me a

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,139
welder in my hand I am always afraid of

61
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:15,659
burning everything but sooner or later

62
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,579
in short, someone told me go

63
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:21,329
do it that cares I'm lost person

64
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,940
rome then became a passion because

65
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,739
altovino because then I started

66
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,989
teaching here at the university it is the end

67
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,090
the sign with the farmhouses so it was

68
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,250
just an encounter with a  reality where

69
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,750
laborers just here to make the

70
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,590
doc then the maker environment here hong

71
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,680
kong are machine gen

72
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,629
is here around the corner so even

73
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:48,870
that a team maker base stay

74
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,879
how long does it take to get to its

75
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,760
winter while quality at 45 minutes

76
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,790
right  corner I repeat left and for

77
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,110
two months then tembre started my

78
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,160
doctorate here my topic of

79
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,910
my thesis on computational artificial creativity

80
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,890
so that we use to excuse

81
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,649
arent  ino rare and rather than my

82
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,800
genetics etcetera to create art

83
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,350
music literature

84
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,820
I think about this my work and rules

85
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,040
for today here I wanted to talk to you about the

86
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,740
project and that he followed together had

87
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,140
the pleasure of collaborating with some

88
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,450
people in the rain maybe mario

89
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,690
here too who  luisa listens to us too but this

90
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,130
is a team project and let's say it starts

91
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,230
from a one a discovery in short for me

92
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,210
the mouth does not discard cathay lamis

93
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,500
tonic exists since 1980 what giovanni

94
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,510
meridie viola centro because

95
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:10,070
our stamp is known and why not

96
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,440
then the mechanics that  what is poleman

97
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,210
so large historical is a way

98
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,240
of licking three-dimensional audio

99
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,090
so if we imagine it ok before

100
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,280
1930 there was the world there was not a

101
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,790
single signal that was the music the

102
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,220
gramophone program then it increased

103
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,470
the stereo in the sky on the left is the

104
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,350
right but it is actually in our

105
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,510
experience it limits the sound comes from

106
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,900
all directions so

107
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,270
let's say to visualize  are a man not from

108
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,320
in space like a sphere and therefore

109
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,160
every direction can come a wave and

110
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,300
how to make

111
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,790
the lincoln in of this of this

112
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,590
information in the end it was a problem

113
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:04,290
that is still solved in 1980 with sony

114
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,009
kobe to form called

115
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:10,639
and war the  football that having

116
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,219
the audio recorded in this mode

117
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:16,430
makes it clearly complete in its

118
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,809
format but then reproducing

119
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:23,180
this format in any set of

120
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,939
speakers so if I have a stereo for

121
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:29,719
heaven's sake or for a stereo but if I have 15 20

122
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:30,979
30 speaker

123
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:33,649
I  I can take this this image

124
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:37,789
this representation of the

125
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:42,879
audio environment and play it back on an arbitrary number of the

126
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,520
arbitrary pic let

127
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,460
's say there is a minimum resolution limit which

128
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:54,740
are four piano speakers obviously

129
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,159
this has been able to scale that a circle

130
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,979
from 15 meters with 30  speaker therefore there

131
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:03,529
is no real speaker wall limit

132
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:07,459
upwards minimum rate and

133
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,219
therefore obviously the more speakers there are

134
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:12,830
more at the resolution more then

135
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:18,770
the  'effect is let's say precise the problem

136
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,180
which is where this

137
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,120
one year masters student collided with this

138
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,939
and every two years side I know

139
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:30,709
that he also interested this topic and

140
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:34,599
there are really no easy ways to

141
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:37,459
create these these multi systems

142
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:40,159
speaker then with a large number of

143
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,769
speakers and vehicles or geek I say but

144
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:47,839
since somehow maybe

145
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,159
we can

146
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,349
do it I have not invented some

147
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:56,300
croc and that subsequently, in any case,

148
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,029
the push already comes from wanting to create the

149
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:04,969
easy low cost system to have

150
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:06,529
the  'failure experience are

151
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:09,669
three-dimensional with the number of speakers

152
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:16,519
enel greater than 10 and it should be noted

153
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,399
here this is let's say a little the structure

154
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,079
of the missoni that therefore there is the first the

155
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,329
first ball at the top represented the

156
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:26,240
mono the individual final then there are

157
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,999
the  three years Cartesian elections his

158
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:31,459
left top bottom forward back

159
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:33,529
then there are some harmonics this

160
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:38,588
is now that I hope that those who know of

161
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,490
physics these s  o also the orbitals

162
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,199
of the electrons on the others so there is

163
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:47,689
a bit of math behind it, talk about it

164
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:52,189
mentally more speakers or more

165
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:55,880
fundamental waves I can reproduce and

166
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,519
then this is a bit of damage to have a

167
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,069
lot of bad luck

168
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:03,319
the team boss mario mario but why

169
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:06,249
should he follow us from  tweaking

170
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:12,470
something questions but also me and timothy is

171
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,439
a german guy who was here when

172
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:21,350
we have a period after never that being

173
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,600
an exchange that starts as we

174
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,870
did always ready as we did

175
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:34,899
is therefore the first fundamental tool

176
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:39,249
jack you have ever used it heard disco all  the

177
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:44,680
usual jack as a package

178
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,740
would be audio that allows

179
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,860
applications to pass audio in

180
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,579
real time to and from this jack has

181
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:57,670
a function to switch in real time

182
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,740
via ethernet then using a

183
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,279
traditional ip connection

184
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,589
multicast excuse and therefore very efficient that

185
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,029
redistributes  the lover all channels

186
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:12,199
everywhere austere well equivalent of

187
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:16,939
macrame which is used to create the de  coder

188
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:20,720
therefore lies a correspondence

189
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,540
between the position of the speaker and what

190
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,600
things that speaker of the fact reproduce them

191
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,790
because if the speaker is forward he will have to

192
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,370
reproduce the channel I ask if he will

193
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,230
explain it behind where precisely then

194
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,850
in fact it is a matrix of coefficients

195
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,889
what goes to  actually finish in

196
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,370
the speakers this can see

197
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,029
later what what it does through faust

198
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:49,939
creates this decoder and then takes the

199
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:57,050
sonic signal and prints it flight

200
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,879
reproduces it on the specific speaker

201
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,980
based on the position that stopped in the

202
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,139
center of the room of the space  other

203
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,960
tools that obviously then pass

204
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,089
will be

205
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,569
for creating content or making

206
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:18,300
contribution clubs are supercolliders of this

207
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,620
excellent open source tool that this more

208
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,290
but programmatic or solution by

209
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,930
marechal and as max msp ableton live which in

210
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,350
any case can be integrated with jack

211
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,269
because in fact already  that are experienced

212
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,930
simply a virtual sound card

213
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,370
from the point of view you can not see it  and

214
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,100
also maybe from the other camera I don't know

215
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,189
if this is shared but let's take a

216
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:47,309
ride later there are 32 speakers that we have

217
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,069
more squalid machine often just

218
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:51,749
maybe less than 10 euros

219
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:55,949
air grab pie that is let's say from the

220
00:11:55,949 --> 00:12:02,129
point of the ip connection that

221
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:05,759
receives receives signal  Beretta is sovereign

222
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,559
and we have attached an ark to it a 10

223
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,569
so it transforms the digital

224
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:17,120
signal the analog signal is integrated a

225
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,189
classifier class of therefore very

226
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:21,839
efficient does not consume so much it is not

227
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,529
in short I am the best in the world but with

228
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:29,639
50 euros I can say I can give power to

229
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,879
four speakers  and having two channels one

230
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,350
mind faster let's talk more expensive

231
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,220
we actually scale until the

232
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,399
network explodes with or gigabit

233
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,509
probably at you go out to a lot of

234
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:50,449
channels with 100 krupp ast alternet which is

235
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:53,610
limited in some way to be equal to

236
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,399
32  channels i went great i think thats

237
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,509
the other the other element is

238
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:06,209
called the as hans there are pictures

239
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:09,379
since i show in detail  I

240
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:13,319
this is the final result of the first

241
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:16,379
interaction we had is this

242
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:22,470
a structure is not a Pythagorean solid

243
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:28,089
a truncated black and white knows that you are

244
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:28,600
doing

245
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,129
there is someone who is making the

246
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:32,410
selections of the sphere there is between almost the

247
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,639
particularity of  this of this form

248
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,269
that every joint every corner the same

249
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,149
in its way of the same the same poles

250
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:46,060
so there is always a square and a

251
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,339
hexagon and therefore mario who is our

252
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:54,459
Trieste designer has designed this

253
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,930
added so this you see at the

254
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,129
top right  and we printed 3d in

255
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:05,019
china for I think 15 20 euros per third up

256
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,759
to a bit hard plastic even if

257
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,560
you then see on the right and then there are the

258
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,000
strings because they do not fit very

259
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,129
well and each with dunes of those

260
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,379
boxes inside the truth and this was

261
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:20,880
steri fi with black with

262
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,430
with amplifier of them that

263
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:29,070
quiet plug via thumbs and the

264
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,380
boxes we change printed with

265
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,710
laser 3d with these are the

266
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,570
car speakers and this the p  rima version here

267
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,210
we are the ones who built

268
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,630
kilometers of ethernet cables like the killers

269
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:47,010
because in fact the eternit revenues

270
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,530
athens carry some data of the

271
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,790
current so the that we had some

272
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,550
old

273
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,450
devecchi powerslide the computer

274
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,269
maybe there are some photos this is the

275
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,220
second version  so we

276
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,260
realized somehow that that version in the

277
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,230
first was too small that is there could

278
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,149
only be one person and so

279
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:12,860
we said well let's try to find

280
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,260
a shape that allows us to have more

281
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,209
space in between so more people and

282
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,220
sonohra are inside  and this car

283
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,360
has already come in these 8 totems with

284
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,180
four speakers each so we have

285
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,520
a good distribution around the center

286
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,660


287
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,800
the mechanism is the same we

288
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,950
simply have to disassemble now the bars and then

289
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,390
reassemble the instrument built the

290
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,870
wooden structure with these

291
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,970
net seism of some silica and  very

292
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,910
easy actually also because in hong kong there

293
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,280
are always shops and they are all in the

294
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,550
same place  post so if you need mythical

295
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,150
comings and goings there for the shopping between him and here

296
00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:00,720
this is also the primacy the furness is

297
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,630
therefore ready these connectors for perhaps

298
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,930
less than a euro on the trunk they went

299
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,510
so Ticino where I can not read

300
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,280
vehemently but only wanting for images  I

301
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:19,540
get the wrong things but this is

302
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,680
when we went to sora here on this

303
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,150
project it was born because it needs to

304
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,820
stay there I had the opportunity to

305
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,040
bring to be able to bring something

306
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,560
they play with healing this festival that is

307
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,400
native to barcelona that we say all

308
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,670
one  tradition on multi

309
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,210
media technology are is because there is a festival

310
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,860
next to slaughterhouses next to some kind of

311
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,990
conference that passes them and we are sound

312
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,590
plasty we brought these two

313
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,590
samps our our top ten we have this

314
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,380
control center and people in between

315
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,460
and  danced and let's say had no

316
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,660
content that we developed through

317
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,380
let's say students of that year

318
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,970
we produced the content for this

319
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,040
platform so there is  a game they

320
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,160
have created a game that assumes but

321
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,740
has done to be blindfolded so

322
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,890
have no visual input and all

323
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,430
interactions took place via sound

324
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,760
and you can see them but here above here it is here at the

325
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,220
top of this is the tracker of the bar of

326
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,929
an excessive live

327
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:42,850
we used the controllers only of

328
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,529
bayern for play practically killing

329
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,389
a monster in the right direction but

330
00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:50,919
mentally for absence to be able to

331
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:52,720
see it then using only one sound

332
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,519
and the lick direction of the color sound

333
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,559
there is an experience that many people are

334
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,730
approved if  amused and this was

335
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,039


336
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,659
another one we thought about it a bit modular because

337
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:07,240
we wanted to have the possibility of being able to

338
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,379
carry it around and also disassembled and

339
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:15,700
reassembled and therefore the versatility a

340
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,399
bit of this system that takes you 4 to

341
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:21,070
deal with the speaker failures more  or

342
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,269
not you must also do you think this

343
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,440
installation quest we had given

344
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,169
less that is so these are only

345
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:35,710
I think 8 we stole from a computer

346
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,049
q  ua old with the west

347
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:40,179
so we try to use the components as

348
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:43,960
little as possible that this is a couple

349
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,149
of basic live set up and after each of

350
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:51,070
these actions but in reality it is close to

351
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,200
its speakers and speaker powers the

352
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,510
advantage which was that then

353
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,180
to the  inside any space and I can

354
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,850
put the speakers then create each of

355
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,800
my decoders then create my decoder scheme starting from the

356
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,550
position of the speakers

357
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,770
then take the sonic b and that

358
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,810
there is black the single signals for each

359
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,700
single sticker starting from that format

360
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,690
that  it is always the same and this is how

361
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,330
open an exhibition is this other examples

362
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,040
of how we tried to use

363
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,620
this is an election that ended burning

364
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,430
man

365
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,170
last year now I know that I did not

366
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,190
use the speakers but they had used

367
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,370
this small model the boulders  This system,

368
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,860
on the other hand, was a hybrid with some

369
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,860
other speakers and a subwoofer that he

370
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,410
found there for a conference where they

371
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,570
did a session where they did not dance where

372
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,770
they were closed pre  feel

373
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,940
particular we do to show that

374
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,950
this system is quite flexible

375
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,929
and we thought it sensitive

376
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:01,830
I can show you something

377
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,080
interesting now on a scale not only do

378
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,779
you see this see my skinny

379
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:09,379
now I am a bit small but this is

380
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:12,119
how they appear this interface

381
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:16,049
seems to zoom like yes  presents the interface

382
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:20,309
of jack jack ct al with it is called

383
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:23,450
the interface that controls this

384
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,869
jack control is that this is the latest

385
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:30,799
version it is not difficult to find

386
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,730
the last people probably that

387
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,740
easy to fill in the right that it takes

388
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,809
a lot of waste and  a lot of

389
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:40,230
monates but i think they are trying to

390
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,179
rationalize the release process

391
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,360
of theirs for six already so be

392
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,669
it easier to get in the future

393
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,769
primacy here we go briefly explain

394
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:57,899
here on the left the first is the system

395
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:02,759
so this is an aggregate interface

396
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:05,639
of  all my devices that are

397
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,460
here the magic somehow they do

398
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,009
these blocks here these are the blo  cchi

399
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:15,259
compiled as said with faust that

400
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:17,399
transform the sonic ambient signal

401
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:20,429
so these if dumps you see that

402
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,830
you see here are a format years of

403
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,350
sonic then I have 16 channels that instead are

404
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,690
specific to the positions of each

405
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,789
speaker in this this object in

406
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:35,820
fact transforms into a format that  it is the

407
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,759
format of forming in and format that he

408
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,059
informed that it actually depends on

409
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,759
where the sources are while the format

410
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,570
is usually independent and here on the right

411
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,590
here they are you see the eight totems

412
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,529
so the toni is nothing more than a

413
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:59,990
raspberry stage on which  turn

414
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,260
silent thing small quest

415
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:08,080
on which it runs I used arc inox weapon

416
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,000
which is the version of arc for weapon because

417
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,330
yes why I like arkansas why rasma

418
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,180
arc famous breasts newer goods less

419
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,200
problems debut so I did this

420
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,820
you make a share I think basically

421
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,130
no difference between using Erasmian

422
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,410
any other important distribution

423
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,480
that is already in

424
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:39,710
on this particular one we used is

425
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:44,180
that with  low then interface

426
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,730
low and there are those who wonder set up shows

427
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,670
us what the sources are at this

428
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,280
moment wants success the channel

429
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,510
also says a bit the equivalent of

430
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,840
this graphic design I can see

431
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,990
what I can connect I can also see

432
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,170
that  what is already connected then it is not that

433
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,950
the screw huts

434
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,510
we do as the one that connects

435
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,340
and then I have to give the name

436
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:25,179
is the source of the sound and playback and

437
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:27,640
we mention the spi that therefore centuries

438
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,140
connect these are all things that in

439
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,809
fact are the viruses are in the

440
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:35,950
system realization scripts then you

441
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,470
put them in systems they start

442
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,760
automatically every time I

443
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,600
turn on the system of bears they connect

444
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,240
and let's say that the problem is somewhat solved

445
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,010
then from the point of view

446
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,250
of the operating system where where we then

447
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,850
generate the  'audio is completely

448
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,110
invisible all this part

449
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,380
when it enters the jack that jack takes

450
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,309
care of passing through the queues

451
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,250
and sending it to the various cl  ient tourism

452
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,470
another similar one can see the stop

453
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,210
when as soon as it was this should

454
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,179
disappear here it is not disappeared we

455
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:18,899
can start again

456
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:24,360
those in short so it is perhaps too

457
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,920
simple explained there are some

458
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,500
complications subtracted if

459
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,270
you need cases of presentations then

460
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:35,160
ask the last thing you don't

461
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,050
sell here is this is the rows of hoxha

462
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:44,520
roma slam what where you specify

463
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,160
the positions of the speakers you can't

464
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,980
see me this the 32-channel version

465
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:55,170
here every tot a position of the large 0 the

466
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,970
radius  it is always the same because it is a

467
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:02,310
circle the height is calculated because a

468
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:07,710
cylinder and therefore it is a position of the

469
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:12,420
speaker within the totem and then

470
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,700
obviously we go to 45 degrees 90 degrees

471
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,810


472
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:20,720
55 my motto once this

473
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,150
grinds I have to specify file  there is a trace

474
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,440
for has however in fact what the

475
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,420
generates is a basketball file

476
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,850
this

477
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,190
yes exactly what I am using

478
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,040
what I just see but in fact

479
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,890
here in a series of ca  nal in input which

480
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:45,410
are the channels modeling usually

481
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,050
of order 3 format then up to the

482
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,390
fourth row of that of the image with

483
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,550
all the boost shoes at the beginning and

484
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,920
these are the speakers the laptops so they

485
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,150
are all 32 strickers and then these

486
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,370
matrix room  that generated everything

487
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,630
pass even look maximum of trust

488
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,610
and then from this of factors comes out

489
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,760
through faust an executable that I can

490
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,220
launch in fact here you can see

491
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,389
this is a very simple script

492
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:19,339
that simply starting all

493
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:23,450
these components of faust that

494
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,329
connect to the jack is not  a couple forced

495
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:28,549
and then the collar and they do what

496
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:30,200
they have to do

497
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,070
so this is let's say how it works or

498
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,609
yes there are specific questions about

499
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:40,219
this I am I would have another little

500
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:44,419
gem first 15 minutes that they but I

501
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:47,749
do not know if you are almost springing gem  it is

502
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:50,869
because it seems to me that it could take

503
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:52,940
up to 15 minutes before moretto

504
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,149
aerial time at the same time a story is

505
00:26:56,149 --> 00:27:03,129
fine but if a story is part 2000 18

506
00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:08,349
see this video first of all

507
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:20,059
take it here and there you can hear the

508
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:21,649
stereo audio magheggio pasta in a way the

509
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:26,649
birdman wall assistance pedal and

510
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:29,450
I turned off the audio but I don't know if

511
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:50,089
you are close to how many have heard

512
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:52,969
talk about this humanoid robot

513
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:54,820
around the world

514
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,919
[Music]

515
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:10,539
because I

516
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,290
'm ok ok you want to look at it look at it

517
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:21,030
so there are subtitles so state

518
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,280
you see here on the left the face if it

519
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,120
recognizes it theme it

520
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,179
is us

521
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:35,810
who mount it small still

522
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,190
I like it tells marina

523
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,090
there is  another friendfeed and my beard

524
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:53,370
but then I'm going it's the one dressed

525
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,440
all right because I looked

526
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,570
good there is the first euro now so

527
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,500
this is you because it's some beard

528
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,400
sitting that we deny that at that moment

529
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,640
what are you doing the  contract of the father I

530
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,650
am never to the dogs also to the fact that after

531
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,260
the end of the video he is good he was a bit

532
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,530
behind the descent three scenes

533
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,760
as we noticed with we brought them

534
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,410
so in short I finished nothing

535
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,800
was an act  mo prima casa non vide does not

536
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,580
know how to keep how much more he uses this video

537
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,710
30 million have arrived so they are

538
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,520
salted in a video from 30 million

539
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,870
this video to 30 million let's

540
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,270
explain the reason why this video

541
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,820
may have 30 million euros

542
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,440
but who did wismith for how much  well

543
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,780
bowie smith and when and how much it depends I'll

544
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,560
drink guilt according to that this desire to

545
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,180
drop and half was it was a coincidence

546
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,720
because there is this this summit in

547
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,580
this test for those like me who have seen the

548
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,790
parts with the most beautiful mega patio or

549
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,650
balcony on the  sea these had in fact

550
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,970
paid sofia to go there to have

551
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,470
the experience I had that I can

552
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,270
also contextualize in the hood only

553
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:19,860
this end 2017 2018

554
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,220
they still love had this start

555
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,960
of rent of the devil atmar show

556
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,940
analyzed to have a lot of

557
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,520
requests or they can  having the ok will save

558
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,470
them for having only like two

559
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,960
house developers who rightly

560
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,580
also had to develop instead of

561
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,010
going around carrying robots they

562
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,440
asked around  or here at the exchange there is

563
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,900
someone who can go around

564
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,850
the world to take robots to do

565
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,090
stuff

566
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,169
and then they always promise things you

567
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:52,600
can walk alone can talk can

568
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,900
make logic then obviously the turn

569
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,210
it takes to walk  we are that

570
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,240
the illusion however these things are

571
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,299
written whatever comes to

572
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:08,169
dictate things the things that this brand says

573
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:10,870
of the writings also robot

574
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,570
with two functions so a can go

575
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:19,550
in full auto mode which then pays an

576
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:23,570
additional soft we speak is a

577
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,790
series of  rules function of some

578
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:30,640
topic that tries to understand then it sometimes

579
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,960
lasts especially if there is nothing

580
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,640
contextual type knows where she was yesterday

581
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,910
how disgusting you are here in norway

582
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,110
those things there she does not know the stars

583
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,420
norway has no idea

584
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,670
green video what time it is

585
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:47,810
and still pro paride the horoscope and it's

586
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,970
fine to do two or 20 minutes with

587
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,360
their salaries sky ato6 cancer in short

588
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,300
series of scripts inside that can

589
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,800
make love impression

590
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,660
then on stage the moment on stage they

591
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,730
can also show some other

592
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,570
is this place this west mit is so

593
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,700
to the test that it stops whole upward

594
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,860
with terrace had them an incredible weapon

595
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,580


596
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,470
this is on the bench like this

597
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,080
my second experience they have me  yes i

598
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,140
went like he

599
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,240
can do training tuesday the tuesday

600
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,220
after they sent me to bangladesh this

601
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,060
stuff

602
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:36,080
he dumped me which then the prime

603
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,660
minister of the bangladeshi sites who

604
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,540
asked him questions about this branch and I

605
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,540
was there very supported they would correspond

606
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,310
in some way in a  room escaped

607
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,190
because you really didn't know the

608
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,920


609
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,260
whole story and they clearly

610
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,110
think even this sofia is a

611
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,450
liszt world of knowledge of

612
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,310
sensible wisdom even the guards risked

613
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,400
creating a kind a diplomatic accident

614
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:09,680
allows that is he thinks that someone has

615
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,660
noticed that is  of those who pay for

616
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,510
that, however, for the shopper

617
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,910
for the stage, people usually cook

618
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:19,090
and leave a little

619
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,980
bit of  co fooling no one

620
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,870
leaves us conditioned

621
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,060
we think so in short I tried to

622
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,390
bring inspiration child 9

623
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,610
generation to approach this

624
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,080
world of robotics so many

625
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,760
young children leave and

626
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,810
always encourages ready this here we tried

627
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,900
to do only on the guitar and this is to

628
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,220
lisbon

629
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,980
this in the style also flour that

630
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:55,210
where ever did you play the fact

631
00:33:55,210 --> 00:34:01,350
or a piece was a scene where

632
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:06,040
practically she is not at the

633
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,290
commercial house in which she did a commercial with

634
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,270
cristiano ronaldo that therefore I

635
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:14,710
also made myself between sofia and ronaldo who

636
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:22,600
we talked since yesterday sign it up and then

637
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,239
they brought to this room to make

638
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,820
more videos with smoke with things that

639
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,350
I don't know if it seems like she no longer felt mind

640
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,389
done but those things they wanted to do

641
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:33,820
were city can make her play the guitar

642
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,830
and like she has us  it took him twenty minutes to askri it

643
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,440
just seems what he had to do to

644
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,510
keep him standing so in short he is

645
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,060
still not very smart super

646
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,400
intelligent here we talked like I am

647
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,429
a sim

648
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:50,590
talking to you because another let's say

649
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:56,739
his colleague here and we are in sydney as

650
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,450
you can see this is the bridge little

651
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,310
the arbor here you can't see a started the

652
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,320
sace the work uses does not have a feeling

653
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,540
incredible of an

654
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,960
australian company excorations do for

655
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,570
which it fits to talk about the atom species

656
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,960
of brims limen art as usual and

657
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,750
this is this is good i don't know if you have

658
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,160
ever heard it

659
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,380
let's say one of the two characters behind

660
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,710
sofia who is  that if someone looks at

661
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,520
silicon valley but there is a caricature of

662
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,130
sofia that you well know that

663
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:39,080
somehow tripi to hers now ok but in any case

664
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,780
it is not so there is actually well understood

665
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:49,490
even a little eccentric but what it is but

666
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,010
these are only  the operations because and

667
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:56,810
these works are a bit of a bunch

668
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:02,920
of fir engines but it goes from the of arles

669
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,360
practically what runs on

670
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,110
sofia was a series of of motors that

671
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,020
are of actuators that are revealed

672
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,920
by various facial expressions that she does come out

673
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,690
or movements that can be

674
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,710
written made you about the speech of

675
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,510
the chat but that only software from

676
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,500
the hardware point of view these are the

677
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,720
motors that then obviously come off they

678
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,150
break one day I have to take apart

679
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,550
an entire arm because there is a

680
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,400
pinched cable  therefore they are not this way

681
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,310
also of the moments of panic to arrive

682
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,830
on stage and unplug

683
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,510
or yes no partner more you click

684
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,920
even maybe an image this is in

685
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,730
geneva the nations still did

686
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:56,270
even five prime ministers of something and

687
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,480
then a little  of moments even beyond doing

688
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,930
this here on the left in davos in those

689
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,480
years it was just cia and engine

690
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,320
then facial expressions from

691
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,270
porn sites or something

692
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,450
and this is a photo that I never

693
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,010
understood what the meaning of this

694
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,420
photo is but  we do not have at home to make a

695
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,640
face of fear, just a few heart notes

696
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,580
but how many months did he travel with sofia

697
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:27,560
in the end who was more meraldi 2018

698
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:34,380
2018 was the year most when  or he

699
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,350
also receives the doctor's abstract well as he

700
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,990
travels like traveling with a capital

701
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:44,030
already because he had some anecdotes even

702
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,730
if it is estimated that there is because he is from the

703
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,160
typical rco physically like not the

704
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,320
suitcase in a giant room you throw it

705
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,520
in he said before race  instead the head

706
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,700
which is the most delicate part and remains in

707
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,230
some way as hand luggage and

708
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,480
therefore light beloved is inside the

709
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:09,740
suitcase and then passes it in the order

710
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,710
already someone better not food matrices

711
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,460
will be beautiful and electronic then his

712
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,220
these looks  miccichè that then I am

713
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,840
also sees sex also rini for example those in

714
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,150
bangladesh it was the most beautiful moment of

715
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,330
all because I arrived I said it's

716
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,430
okay to leave the cast also come here

717
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,190
bring the suitcase walls instead

718
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,830
the police chief inquires even if

719
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,440
open that everything is okay site from post

720
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,680
that we can make an example from the south and there

721
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,380
were 50 subscribers, that is,

722
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,990
who all worked so they are born because

723
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,410
despite being anti  cried the

724
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,380
prime minister there were the scec asi it

725
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,740
was spoken as if it were there were

726
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,230
presented as if it were practically

727
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,990
alive pescara seen thoughts

728
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,760
then the genius occupied a

729
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,740
control space fake

730
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:10,720
but what was inside the times then

731
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,700
at the exit  caravelli because I went

732
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,320
to the counter then throws three between dario then

733
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,940
the people from the airport province

734
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,770
everyone knows each other so it will be charm even

735
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,780
that one arrives with sofia you almost come but

736
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,270
there is check in in meadows I check in

737
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,320

738
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,110
you want but you have to make me do a self by

739
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,869
sending in there is the head of

740
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:44,680
security born he imports milan 15 May

741
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,440
on the web and in any case two short support

742
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,750
because it is part of his own game I know

743
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:54,970
but theoretically it would not be yes we are

744
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,800
not even saying to the politics of

745
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,860
curtain show the disassembled robot they

746
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,350
do not want somehow rom they wanted to

747
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,840
touch a ready and enough magic there is the

748
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,510
subtle always seeing itself whole

749
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:11,109
because impersonal because the more you are c  ome

750
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,369
a status symbol

751
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:16,270
because you then giovanni we

752
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,040
still have a minute 6 of the

753
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,320
final considerations to make it is right so to

754
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,160
close anyway because it was very

755
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,410
enjoyable I show one last

756
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:30,190
thing for so just to see not even

757
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,140
a bit of opportunities from the things that

758
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,570
can be done  these one that I did

759
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,869
to make her move her hands this league

760
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:40,480
motion in the lower left

761
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,270
corner the tracking file of the hand and then

762
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,830
afterwards based on the position of the hand

763
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:50,950
she moves the hand she is safe in practice the

764
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:56,009
care we say always

765
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,660
used this one used this  system to make her

766
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,090
move her head because doing with the mouse

767
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:05,590
a little difficult and therefore one of the

768
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,240
inventions that I also have your

769
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,950
suarez and scanner forward

770
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:22,369
did not disgust you smaller

771
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,710
in the same week motion and with the hand

772
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,280
can interact

773
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,010
but she perhaps problems more  emerging on

774
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,420
which on robotics how to create

775
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,819
interface to go to to operate

776
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:40,799
this I admitted that they do not know how to

777
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,930
operate alone c  How can I be a

778
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:52,079
tv dad so write me pleasure

779
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,760
what you know in the group we

780
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,740
also see it again beautiful so if someone has a

781
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,549
bad vision we refer to and when you pass in

782
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:03,329
Italy make yourself alive and for the rest

783
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:06,630
a big thank you for sharing

784
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,700
the experience was  here with us and an

785
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,849
hour is a huge good luck

786
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:16,799
for your doctorate hong kong and different techniques

787
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:17,430


788
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,420
if called busy universities

789
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:27,990
remember november that law well

790
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:32,460
thanks to open it to hot air and it

791
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,359
all happens
