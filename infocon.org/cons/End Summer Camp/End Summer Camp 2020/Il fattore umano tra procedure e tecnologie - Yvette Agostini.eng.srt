1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
then thanks seba i took it for granted

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,940
that we know each other they are all friends as

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,490
usually happens to esc in non-hybrid people

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,950


5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,279
i am the old ones as sebha said i

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,369
have been

7
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,900
dealing with various topics related to teen

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,340
safety in general

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,910
l  'IT and tonight I want to

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,989
talk to you in a very quiet way and

11
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:38,969
so just to share the

12
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,219
reflections I have made in these years

13
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,760
of the human factor between procedure and

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,399
technologies now I do not know you confirm that

15
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,670
you see the slides yes yes I would say that I

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,070
I will see then we will see

17
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,949
now let's go first of all the very

18
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,960
short disclaimer the material in this

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,780
presentation is the result of my free

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,790
interpretation of widely known concepts of the

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,830
industry or that there should

22
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,860
be and of the critical reworking of

23
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,750
personal work experiences the

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,390
creative commons license on the side there

25
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,670
are  of the cartoons that are available

26
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,470
on the net there numerous sites where possible

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,479
the direct link to the site has been indicated  or the

28
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,619
author

29
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,400
just so as not to conflict with the

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,840
license and various things

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,880
and let's start immediately with a very well-known

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,270
cartoon that I think we all know

33
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,759
data security the famous ring where

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,420
data security fight and the user

35
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,640
in fact the speaker announces that a

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,829
corner we do it there  'encryption

37
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,470
antivirus etc. and in the other corner

38
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,619
we have the user dave or the human

39
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,759
and human error what is it when one makes a

40
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,920
mistake and in fact we

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,290
at least have seen it in many years and I

42
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,760
drink it all

43
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,910
na most of the problems arise from  a

44
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,450
human error our environment

45
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,789
what roman means true roman

46
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,850
means human factor but the

47
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,600
human factor the novelty the human factor is a

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,960
very well known thing of engineering

49
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,180
very well known in general in everything that

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,300
has to do with activities that can

51
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,220
put  at risk the life of people

52
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,530
or in any case create considerable damage if

53
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,000
things go wrong is a definition perhaps

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,880
the best known and known definition a

55
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,740
nenè bianca very good but not  it is not even

56
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,710
mekhissi but this is what I have reported

57
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,200
here that is human factors some

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
human factor is not only one there are many

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,800
have people as their object of study

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,520
while they demand their

61
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,380
jobs their insertion into the

62
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,390
work environment understood in a physical and

63
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,090
interpersonal and their relating to the

64
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,160
work tools and procedures to

65
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,690
which

66
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,190
the objective of this research must be

67
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,989
followed pursuing safety and efficiency

68
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,900
now I know that in our field there are

69
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,550
some people who are passionate about

70
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,850
flying and therefore they already know that this

71
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,120
definition occurs  from the from the ICAO from the

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,470
international civil aviation

73
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,500
organization I have reported to you concretely

74
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,980
so if you want to read the entire

75
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,510
document which is a very

76
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,030
interesting reading you can read it but

77
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,830
what is important is that this

78
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,620
definition is understood that Roman does not

79
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,200
depend only on  human believe it or

80
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,510
poor us because I am an area

81
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,840
we are all equal but human error

82
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,530
develops internally  or of a context that

83
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,489
is made up of many aspects but really

84
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,590
many the task somebody is

85
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,510
dedicating to the work environment in which

86
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,730
the tools he is using are inserted

87
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,890
which can be hardware

88
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,150
software and procedures now the speech

89
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,329
they have to do I want to do a little

90
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,040
broader is not limited only to the environment,

91
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,200
let's say so

92
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,660
creative, where there is a work environment

93
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,810
where there are tasks and where there

94
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,600
are well-defined procedures or

95
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,260
there should be but I want to make a

96
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,240
speech in cash or because now

97
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,639
our life is  studded with a series of

98
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,490
devices and software that

99
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,400
accompany us constantly and that in

100
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,889
fact are an integral part of our

101
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:43,610
existence and it is not that we write

102
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,380
the procedures or rather someone does it

103
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,030
some fanatic who fixes

104
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,520
his life and integrates his systems

105
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,970
your devices in a system

106
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,400
with procedures there is however let's say that

107
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,389
we are few

108
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:03,830
here I will put myself too so we see

109
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,169
that people environment str  work documents

110
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:08,120
procedures among how many things there are

111
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,760
behind a trivial oversight the trivial

112
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,770
oversight that for example can lead to and

113
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,979
how it happens and those who work in

114
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:20,539
security know it has for example download and

115
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,500
install a run software that can have

116
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,139
truly devastating effects on the

117
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,729
productivity of a  company or

118
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:33,620
download a malware that can have

119
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,210
devastating effects on a

120
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,330
person's vision and these things are seen because

121
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,130
it is true there should have been

122
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,320
the antivirus yes it is true there should have

123
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,150
been procedures that

124
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,590
protect the user from these events but

125
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,110
but we know  all that no matter how

126
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:59,210
hard one tries p there is always someone who is ahead

127
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,479
nuts one can always be there can be

128
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,370
rome not even in the configurations c

129
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,080
this human error in the procedures there

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,360
can be the error simply that

131
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,539
it is not an error but it is  the fact that there is

132
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,400
new malware there is something that is not

133
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,380
recognized the anti-virus the anti-

134
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,110
spam filtering things and so on

135
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,440
so

136
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:25,629
what is  i teaches us something

137
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:27,699
that in the discipline that is

138
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,249
human factors is called the swiss cheese

139
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:34,509
model or the model of the

140
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:35,830
swiss cheese you do not know that the

141
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,319
swiss cheese is what the holes and therefore

142
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,029
what how it is represented how

143
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,919
the chain is represented

144
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,459
events that lead to the problem that

145
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:50,459
we see at the bottom right of the slide

146
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:55,869
then there are 12 we start from the last

147
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:57,899
square the last slice of cheese

148
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,360
that is human error the error but

149
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,379
in reality it starts much earlier there are the

150
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:08,889
famous factors  upstream there is

151
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,740
now a lack of television there are

152
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,439
conditions for the wrong actions the

153
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,180
conditions as they are with the environmental ones

154
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,689
for example haste the fatigue poor

155
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,599
communication the lack of knowledge of the

156
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:24,939
means and tools and so on

157
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:28,089
the film gets to the human that  it is

158
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:30,610
in the situation of material and

159
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,209
the problem is generated this is known in the

160
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:36,399
literature as the model of the slices

161
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,829
of cheese and it shows  as in reality

162
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:43,300
that final event which is the

163
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,099
problem that manifests itself is not only

164
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,709
triggered by an error more or less due

165
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:57,009
to registration or other but to a chain

166
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,969
of reasons upstream of that error, that is,

167
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:03,519
before that there are so many conditions

168
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,979
that  led to the occurrence of

169
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:13,770
this thing of this event is one that

170
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,979
came to mind when he thought these

171
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,819
almost that often in mind is when

172
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:24,210
gilberti you know him when there is the

173
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,210
bears that says look that you your

174
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,419
user requirements include 404 following

175
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,029
features you  you realize that no

176
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:35,520
human will be able to use the product

177
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,339
with such a level of complexity and the

178
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,919
customer has a good point

179
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,649
I will do well to reach ease of use the

180
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,209
list now we part functions we

181
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:49,890
really use our

182
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,470
software devices I take a random example

183
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,290
powerpoint  or equivalent

184
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,320
have you ever seen how many features if you

185
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,240
really use them all

186
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,180
at times the nerdy and

187
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,579
especially human people have the faintest

188
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:09,990
idea

189
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,940
it is true for that but it is also true for

190
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,399
much more complex software it is also true

191
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,260
for simpler trivial software such as a

192
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,260
text editor such as a movie

193
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,899
on linux hours

194
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,300
how many features year that we do not

195
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,680
know I am still learning

196
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,839
now after more than 20 years that it  I use

197
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,140
new features new features

198
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,390
and this said by a nerd that is a

199
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,399
person who works with this technology

200
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,339
every day who is used to

201
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,399
being in a curious critical way

202
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,600
towards a software of a

203
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,720
device but the average user that is the

204
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,209
average person who is in front  to his

205
00:09:54,209 --> 00:10:00,270
smartphone to his computer and carries out

206
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,700
his work activities that

207
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,040
attitude towards these 400 features

208
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,040
so we see that there is already a

209
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,950
problem here if we return to the question of the

210
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:20,029
slice of cheese no we see that

211
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,520
the user is wrong but the conditions  for

212
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,649
the action started and certainly there is not

213
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:27,130
complete knowledge

214
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,360
of the tool he is using often

215
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,890
have no idea about that one  o what

216
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,160
the tool really can do that is I

217
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,050
don't know if you've ever seen it yes you've seen it I

218
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,680
'm almost certain the user who creates a

219
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,140
sort of database through the

220
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,330
excel sheet obviously reaches the limit

221
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,980
of the fillable lines and is

222
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,770
usually blocked  I happened to

223
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,630
be called to say yes but I can not

224
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,580
add lines why

225
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,500
but who will it possibly be maybe because it is not a

226
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,010
database it is not made for that it

227
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,500
was not designed to do what you and

228
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,390
this thing happens and continues to

229
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,280
happen that is not  it happened ten years

230
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,900
ago and I keep hearing

231
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,110
this thing and whoever reads the manuals

232
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,840
nobody is always there

233
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,030
who reads rtf henry del fare but

234
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,870
not who reads them already we struggle

235
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,910
to read them because because it is difficult to

236
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,460
write a good  manual because it is

237
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,050
difficult to write a manual that is

238
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,120
updated with the continuous changes

239
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,350
we make for example the software

240
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,690
when we buy a new smartphone

241
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,260
there is perhaps the manual perhaps there is a

242
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,830
sheet folded in 4 on which there

243
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,610
are four basic things and just

244
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,570
stop and online

245
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,180
in my opinion how many go to read it

246
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,670
in my opinion is zero and we go to the

247
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,970
company and read the procedures the terms

248
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,340
of service the paralysis policy of the

249
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,630
cookie policy

250
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,410
who  writes who has to write

251
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:17,400
who has to approve the maybe and hopefully they will

252
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,810
be maintained by those who are

253
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,530
on the piece of that specific piece of

254
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,910
software or procedure but very often

255
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,700
when we bring the company to

256
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,920
consult we see that the procedures are

257
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,630
dead letter

258
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,220
at best  of the hypotheses are

259
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,400
updated periodically

260
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,350
in the worst case scenario we

261
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,660
may not have to intervene in a

262
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,740
situation in which we have had a

263
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,980
problem maybe and we find that the

264
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,760
procedures concern systems of ten

265
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,410
years ago

266
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,000
in the meantime they have changed a lot of

267
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,440
things but the time to change  the

268
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,030
procedures there has not been read even

269
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,800
an hour by reading the important for the

270
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,660
procedures

271
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,790
or the cams  white on care and those

272
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,030
that are more important in case

273
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,280
an expression comes in case

274
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,760
a problem arrives etc.

275
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,960
and this thing is disturbing because

276
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,360
a large amount of apple is produced

277
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,660
that in reality is very little and

278
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,700
always about the manuals and the

279
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,870
user interface

280
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,830
now it is true that using the

281
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,100
modern smartphone a modern computer is much

282
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,830
simpler than what it could have been 20

283
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,440
years ago 20 years ago a system

284
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,100
smartphones

285
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,580
in short, an iphone for good or bad they

286
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,140
took it a two-year-old child is

287
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,790
able to use it because why c  'was

288
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,880
intuitive interface always dilbert

289
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,370
tells his boss our customers

290
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,080
can't understand how to use

291
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,750
the user interface they should read

292
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,570
the manual our manual more

293
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,060
confusing than our

294
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,700
user interface confusing then they should

295
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,490
use the online interface from the

296
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,310
online support of  online support database which

297
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,840
even more confusing than our

298
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,240
manual and but we have no budget to

299
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,730
fix  these things and situations like

300
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,750
these i

301
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,610
go my special place says the

302
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,330
manager and puts his head in the sand

303
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,400
no

304
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,090
and this thing is partly true and partly

305
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:41,410
not

306
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,440
because it is true that modern software devices

307
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,500
are much more

308
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,860
intuitive than some time ago  but they are

309
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,050
intuitive in making us do functions

310
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:58,310
to make us understand how to use it for the

311
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,600
purposes of those who choose sold and this is

312
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,610
important

313
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,040
to me it has often happened in recent

314
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,839
years I am also involved in

315
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,810
training it has happened very often to

316
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,100
meet people even courses that

317
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,529
have not  idea of where to look for which

318
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:20,120
applications are installed on the

319
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,050
smartphone but we have the faintest

320
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,480
only dreaming they know how to surf the internet

321
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,850
maybe they

322
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,560
automatically configure the mail because now they

323
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,209
do it

324
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:35,660
automatically tells them that there is the gmail case

325
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,579
judge which some users and  your password

326
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:42,760
in fact that not only perfect but

327
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,260
the user in this way is totally

328
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,540
unrelated to everything gl  i would need to

329
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,940
know in order to avoid making mistakes

330
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,060
and this thing is quite disturbing

331
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,020
in my opinion indeed very disturbing

332
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,950
and this is what I notice that they are perhaps

333
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,860
small maybe you have also noticed you

334
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,020
he made an exit scenes of the doubts

335
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,440
of the uncertainties of the perplexities

336
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,860
or how  we said at the beginning

337
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,260
now we are surrounded and surrounded by

338
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,070
more or less invasive software and hardware it

339
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,680
is a few months ago the event of that

340
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,570
girl that her mother gave him if it

341
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,630
cost the smartphone and she

342
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,820
chopped from what from the refrigerator

343
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,930
now in the moment  where we are

344
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,980
surrounded by this plethora

345
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,670
of tools making a mistake

346
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:53,060
we could have disastrous effects

347
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,769
that is if you go to see an apartment

348
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:58,370
recently that I wanted to buy and they

349
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,290
were showing me this marvel of

350
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,559
pilot apartment which is fully

351
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,829
crafted for gadget name that  you

352
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,760
can give them the voice commands

353
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:14,199
I do not want to live in a place

354
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,569
like that excuse me because I  I don't want to

355
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,260
have control over this thing that is

356
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,000
last year it was a year and a half ago it

357
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,289
happened that name of a device that

358
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:28,960
listens to commands and executes them

359
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,059
made a mistake and sent one

360
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:33,940
person the data of another

361
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,190
but we are  jokingly I want to have

362
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,780
control over these things the problem is

363
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,419
that technology gallops

364
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:43,179
false marketing good job they make us buy

365
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:45,059
beautiful things wonderful

366
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:50,260
spectacular miraculous however the

367
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,620
perception of the risk we run for

368
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,580
a trivial human factor error is

369
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,750
poor

370
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,700
there was very little  people and while the

371
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,980
human factor that is the artifact the

372
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,140
national human factors is something that has

373
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,140
been developed in the nautical management

374
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,010
of the naval industry

375
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,010
in the medicine industry in the

376
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,580
nuclear industry that is all environments where it is

377
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,669
evident that a human error can have

378
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:23,049
disastrous consequences

379
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:27,240
we are heading towards this

380
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,130
almost miraculous hyper-connected society

381
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,049
with all these devices,

382
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:37,840
software, etc.  hetera which, however, can

383
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,990
put us at a really great risk

384
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,700
without people being

385
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,159
aware of this, therefore the

386
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,080
human factor problem is no longer

387
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,850
just some structured and

388
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,179
structurable areas because it is clear that to

389
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:54,760
drive a plane one must have

390
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,470
specific training  must know

391
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,440
a whole series of aspects that if there is a

392
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,200
crew this must be trained in

393
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,970
a certain way and so on and the same

394
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,260
goes for a so says a

395
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,919
nuclear power plant but the housewife is not expected

396
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,010
what the normal user  the

397
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,920
person

398
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,810
like us normal humans a normal who

399
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,710
is not [ __ ] who is not a hacker who has no

400
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,180
propensity and curiosity for these

401
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,450
aspects he poses this problem they

402
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:33,190
take it for granted that it is so

403
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,260
user manuals and procedures against intuitive interface

404
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,510


405
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,220
now the intuitive interface  it's a

406
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,860
beautiful thing also let's understand it too I

407
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,830
like to have comfortable lambos and rubbery

408
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,890
intuitive interface that guides me

409
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,900
effortlessly in doing what I want  I do

410
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,330
with the object by the hand

411
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,640
the problem is that often and willingly there

412
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,330
are things that cannot be explained

413
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,820
through an iconic

414
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,840
intuitive interface all beautiful rubbery must be

415
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,300
explained the limits of use

416
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,940
of a software object must necessarily

417
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,590
be subject to  somewhere

418
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,200
else and they must be able to be

419
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,880
understood and going out of individuality by going there

420
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,750
organizations also

421
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,150
organizations have changed a lot in

422
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,950
this period of kobe we are seeing it

423
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,990
even more because working remotely

424
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,560
has also brought workplaces that

425
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,870
are often very hierarchical  and vertical

426
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,450
to having to adopt a horizontal diffuse structure

427
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,940
and in a horizontal diffuse structure

428
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,670
the sphere of

429
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,680
personal responsibility and personal competence

430
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,850
above all a series of tools

431
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,400
including work tools which are

432
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,870
hardware software various devices

433
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,480
becomes more individual but always

434
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,970
a piece is missing if we take  again we

435
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,440
remember the example of the f

436
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,790
etta of cheese of the Swiss cheese

437
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,380
we were talking about before

438
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,820
we see that sorry I'll go back for a moment

439
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,860
quickly we see that we are on the

440
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,990
lack of supervision if we pass

441
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,480
to the vertical organizational structure

442
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,610
of a horizontal seamless

443
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,920


444
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,340
and obvious that a whole series of tusks

445
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,590
remain uncovered and therefore  creates

446
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,220
amura of the basic conditions no to have

447
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,830
this dart that goes towards the

448
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:41,169
problem that helps the occurrence

449
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:45,850
of dangerous conditions to occur a

450
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,600
human factor that comes into play is

451
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,980
also another non-

452
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,279
negligible

453
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,600
aspect if before you said we have known each other for

454
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,150
twenty years maybe di  more

455
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,600
in these twenty years I realize

456
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,909
that my ability to learn new things

457
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:04,929


458
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:08,020
an area that has changed my curiosity

459
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,020
is always there but if once 20 years ago

460
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,909
I had to start studying for a

461
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:15,640
whole night I did it without batting  eyelash

462
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,980
now that I have passed a certain age turns

463
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,630
and to start studying for another

464
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,049
whole makes me a bit of an effort and so  i

465
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:28,149
this continually chasing

466
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:30,659
technology the knowledge that is, that they

467
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:35,429
change very quickly that is, in 2008

468
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:40,140
there was not all the mobile that is now

469
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,190
the internet of things is a recent thing

470
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,659
all these aspects require us to

471
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,490
learn very quickly but those who do not

472
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,110
have it  ago a while that is, I have no answers

473
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:00,179
radan has in this talk or are doubts

474
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,610
so many doubts that began to

475
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,460
come to me 20 years ago and that continue to

476
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,710
increase in this period increase at

477
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,110
a dizzying speed exactly

478
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,260
as the speed with which the speed is changing is dizzying

479
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,039
world in which we are living

480
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:24,990
for which I would like this talk to

481
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,870
lead me to ask myself questions and

482
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,559
look for answers around you,

483
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:37,419
perhaps even asking that those who create

484
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:40,620
the things around us that we use

485
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,440
pay a little more

486
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,659
attention to our safety in

487
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:48,799
terms  to make us less susceptible to

488
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:55,639
being subject to those limits to those

489
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:57,740
environmental

490
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,870
conditions that do not condition that make it possible  a

491
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,289
human error that is the intervention the

492
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:05,509
human factor maybe by making

493
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:07,190
intuitive interfaces

494
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,970
but that push us to make

495
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,850
reasoned choices that is to use

496
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,789
technology by reasoning and this is

497
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,850
only the tip of the iceberg

498
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,889
if we were baits in person

499
00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:24,289
probably finished the talk there

500
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:26,870
we will sit around a table with

501
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,509
a beer and maybe basatini to

502
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,309
chat because I am sure that

503
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:33,919
many of us will have things to say about

504
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,870
returning to the exact lighthouse and therefore

505
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,450
I will leave you nothing in the bibliography but I

506
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,240
wanted to tell you two books that in my opinion

507
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,120
deserve to  to be read one is the first

508
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,279
is basically the bible the oil

509
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,399
economic malefactor the second instead

510
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:54,080
a book old enough to

511
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,059
limit the years shortly after

512
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:59,840
the mid 90's has an amazing title

513
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,580
sak pasé oms tran

514
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,970

515
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,129
if  you can find it read it

516
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:09,080
and the last one there is a paper that I

517
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,149
recently discovered in via virtuosa it is

518
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:18,529
called human faiuolo that I did not know

519
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:20,990
that they wrote when I

520
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,029
read it I was struck because

521
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:24,950
they too had the same with ruby

522
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,720
and I also point it out because this

523
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,029
paper can be downloaded with a donation of

524
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,460

525

526

527
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,159
told you about open source intelligence

528
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:40,429
so I was glad that

529
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:42,950
they too had this idea and

530
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,840
therefore I greet you if you have any

531
