1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:07,459
thanks to the hour well there is a lot of talk

2
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:11,240
always you often hear the links

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,580
where it actually went is something

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,830
certainly interesting but

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,100
there are actually a lot of dates you have

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,480
to in different forms when it comes

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,130
to linked open data we mean a

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,850
subset  detail that is

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,129
sufficiently structured to

10
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:41,350
be easily managed and connected

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,969
databases of different sources

12
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:48,870
certainly

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,850
of data there are many there are

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,449
not enough especially if we think in

15
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,480
terms of what is open and what

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,870
they do not ask us is however there are  the

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,709
point is to find a way to have a

18
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,470
way to be able to use them

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,649
for inter customs and extract information

20
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:12,840
from the data that are present that are

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,299
present around and this is the theme that will

22
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,920
introduce in this in this

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,530
intervention so first of all to  part

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,320
to introduce and where to call for those who

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,929
know the tools and

26
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:37,020
characteristics that are the basis of

27
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,909
this type of the world of  of the links is

28
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:48,090
given in this context a data

29
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,220
let's say the database and the

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,140
knowledge bases are structured not like the

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,080
most classic and historically widespread

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,289
relational databases or in similar ways but

33
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,619
with something of a form that is perhaps even

34
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,389
more common but in another way than  it is

35
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,710
the structure that to

36
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,600
that of a sentence of the

37
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,420
natural language in a certain sense, that is, as

38
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,550
terns subject predicate object to

39
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,690
be clear we are talking about things as

40
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,100
expressed in terms of natural language

41
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,810
the sun is a star

42
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,340
the sun is subject to be

43
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:41,000
a star is dedicated  project or the

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,420
sun has a yellow color the sun subject to

45
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,450
color already in the predicate color yellow

46
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,700
object this is not exactly in

47
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,760
line with what maybe my

48
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,230
teacher of my

49
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,570
elementary school teacher would have said in terms of

50
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,880
logical analysis but it is a

51
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,070
simplification that is a

52
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,110
c modeling works in this

53
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,380
context

54
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,170
yet to give a couple more examples

55
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,629
the sun is part of the sol system  are the

56
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,560
sun subject and part and part of

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,939
predicate solar system object the sun

58
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,079
at mass one billion and 988 million and 550

59
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:25,400
thousand citrus fruits obviously very

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,480
easy to imagine

61
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,200
and so on

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,690
therefore subject in this case is always

63
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,780
the same predicate that varies and object

64
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,030
of  different type

65
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,730
this is a

66
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:48,000
very general information description model that you can

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,300
find in different circumstances the

68
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,920
point that I use the thing I use

69
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,900
for in the rest of the intervention as a

70
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,650
source of examples are sharpened by louis

71
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,840
given naturally because I know it well

72
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,090
but also  because it is a

73
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,459
free database with information the

74
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,070
varied and extensive data for which you are

75
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,060
there are found without lob a and it is easy

76
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,000
therefore would make the examples that make

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,320
sense for those who do not know it is a

78
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,900
free knowledge base in the sense

79
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,050
under free license in this case cc

80
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,479
zero so you can do what we

81
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,020
want and it is the one on which points

82
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,270
pedia rests and who lives next to c  as a parallel project

83
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,669
to wikipedia

84
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:52,270
g data is based on a set of units

85
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,710
that are called elements for each

86
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,910
of which declarations are made

87
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,669
not keeping me on the same

88
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,060
examples this that you see is an excerpt

89
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,300
of the page of the sun element

90
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,210
therefore or this element  which represents

91
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,360
the sun that has its own identifier that

92
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,020
echoes 525

93
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,729
therefore from the point of view of wiki given

94
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,430
the fundamental thing is an identifier

95
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,849
whose 525 sun is a label that

96
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:26,250
we give it in Italian to call it and then there

97
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,159
are a series of declarations is

98
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:32,740
a  'instance of yellow dwarf

99
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,509
thing a little more precise than saying that it is

100
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:39,130
a star is part of the solar system

101
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,090
and so on many others is expressed in a

102
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,919
way it is displayed in a

103
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,479
slightly different way but it is the same

104
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,470
pattern as before for which the subject sun

105
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,060
yellow dwarf object instance predicate

106
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,900
this I need to translate the

107
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,340
sentences I wrote earlier into something that is

108
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,600
more manageable from the point of view of the

109
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
computer

110
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,460
qu  then

111
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,240
the

112
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,740
gives you some sentences subject predicate

113
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,440
object my sentence the first phase

114
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,389
he mentioned that I take as an example the

115
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,330
sun is a star how can I translate it

116
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,110
first of all I don't say it's because the

117
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,919
verb to be

118
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,090
is a little too generic what

119
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:43,030
I mean  the sun is something that is

120
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,650
in the category of stars

121
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,830
we say it with an instance of so the sun

122
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,070
is an instance of a star

123
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,280
at this point I have seen that for the

124
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,400
sun or associated an element that has an

125
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,190
in a a certain identifier so I'm

126
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,710
talking about a q  525 similarly the

127
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,139
star the concept of star has its own

128
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:12,830
identifier which is which 523 are

129
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,660
quite close but it is only because

130
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,430
when they have been inserted towards a

131
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,030
similar concepts and put them there however

132
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,030
this does not have any meaning

133
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:28,240
so I know that q5 125 a  distance of 523

134
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,320
as I express and instance of this too

135
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,289
will have its own identifier

136
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:41,539
within ricky data predicates are the

137
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:45,289
properties of the screen

138
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:46,610
preceding

139
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:52,130
the acquis code  ti if you match the

140
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,280
instance property of happy 31 in

141
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,060
general all elements have a

142
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,070
code starting with q all

143
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,409
properties have a code starting

144
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:04,490
with p

145
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,560
so my initial phase the sun a

146
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,860
star becomes on 525 p21 523 point the

147
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,690
point I always keep it because it

148
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,760
defines the term of the sentence for me and

149
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,800
this is something that makes sense not

150
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,130
only in the natural language but also

151
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,690
in this circumstance

152
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,540
[Music]

153
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,010
what can I do with all the other

154
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,770
sentences I have expressed for which the sun  has

155
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:40,729
yellow color which 525 i 462 which 945 has

156
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,660
gone the color properties is

157
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,210
yellow element the sun part of the solar system

158
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:55,730
which 525 i 261 544 the sun to mass that

159
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,270
number

160
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:03,960
on 525 pi 2000 67 one million 988 million

161
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,570
there is one billion and 938  million 550 thousand

162
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,290
eight grams the quantity of

00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,589
corresponding element within g data but

166
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:20,899
who simply a number with unit of

167
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:24,589
measurement the in general in all these

168
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,699
c  asi the subject is the predicate they will

169
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:32,559
have some identifier associated with

170
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,959
the object is not said because it could

171
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,910
be a number it could be a

172
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,620
string or whatever

173
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,279
and here we are

174
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,589
a step of the translation how do I

175
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,759
manage we go to represent had

176
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,319
a representation of these things  that

177
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:59,029
is unique and can associate a wall that

178
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,629
is fully qualified but this is

179
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:07,100
one thing that for the moment we

180
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,759


181
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,019
do not care we do not care too much

182
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,460
so now I have described a way to

183
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,370
represent the data through

184
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,670
your boobs which in fact are

185
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,649
invasion phrases  next once I have them

186
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:26,020
and in the street and information from

187
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,680
these data

188
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,589
what I need is a language a

189
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:33,010
language to query the database

190
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,680
the king of the answers is the one that in

191
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,430
the relational database files that in the case

192
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,649
of rdf there is a language  specific which

193
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:45,640
is called sparkle sparkle

194
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
recursive acronym as usual that they

195
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,350
invented a bit to get something  that it

196
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:57,070
had a good name and also sparkle

197
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,140
somehow the syntax we can

198
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,560
conduct the syntax I don't say with which

199
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,380
we ask a question but in any case how

200
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,660
we can use it to

201
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,880
describe categories of objects

202
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,220
so if we want to ask ourselves which

203
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,100
are the stars of the solar system

204
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,259


205
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,209
not very interesting question because we

206
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:19,799
all know the answer and it is not very

207
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,600
complicated but let's take it as an example

208
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,209
and let's try to translate it into something that

209
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:29,529
is understandable so first of all

210
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:32,300
what I'm really asking is what

211
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,050
are the elements that are stars and which

212
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,219
are four of the system  solar

213
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,780
living to select each element

214
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,000
such that the element is a star is

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,660
the element is part of the solar system

216
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,220
we have seen properties and

217
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,150
elements that correspond to the concept

218
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,910
of being an instance of being part of

219
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,700
them stars solar system so it will

220
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,320
select each  element such that

221
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,020
the element is pictured inside a

222
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:12,610
be 523 and the like below here  and

223
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,490
prefixes because they are used will

224
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,770
then serve to clarify that the first is

225
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,480
actually a property and that the

226
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,120
second actually an element

227
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,550
so

228
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,940
we are using scratches

229
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,800
instead of the bulleted list which is not

230
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,220
so good or this element selects

231
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,540
the mini event such that the  'element

232
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,730
this substantially a variable

233
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,010
so I present it in the way

234
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,779
that sparkle a di would have a variable

235
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,610
indicate a variable that putting

236
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,980
a question mark on it and finally

237
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,950
we pass a little bit to English

238
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,890
saying select is the event that point  of

239
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,079
web question

240
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,850
these two things are worth so here mixed

241
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:09,519
what I am saying with this with

242
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,480
this expression that is our first

243
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,519
those sparkle

244
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,220
I am asking you to select all the

245
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,829
elements where they are worth more

246
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:24,760
these two these two statements that

247
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,680
the element is

248
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,440
a '  star instance and that the element is

249
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,960
part of the solar system

250
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,390
we have our query so we can

251
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:41,210
move on to  d run it I change the

252
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:51,290
sharing for and we arrive at this

253
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,850
this is a is the web page you can

254
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,390
get to

255
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,430
by going to query point holes given

256
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,540
precisely org

257
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,120
and this is one of the other reason

258
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,830
why I chose to use used

259
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,490
as an example because it is easy  show

260
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,380
easy to make queries or an

261
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,930
easy place to use must

262
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,950
have examples with some with some

263
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:20,420
additional things that can be useful in b

264
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,310
I can put my query I execute it

265
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,330
and you give me results the results

266
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,940
unfortunately this time it goes wrong and there

267
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,880
won't be  no result

268
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,940
how come not because i am saying

269
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,650
there are no stars in the solar system

270
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,080
but because i was inaccurate in the

271
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,810
first in the first line i.e. we

272
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,880
said something which is a

273
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,470
star instance but as

274
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,840
booked in the wiki screenshot

275
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,360
given i minsk made  seeing

276
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,190
the sun at first is not often as a

277
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,350
star instance but with a yellow dwarf instance

278
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,540
which is a subclass of a subclass

279
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,020
of the st  she therefore looking for it only

280
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,480
in this way does not find it for me where to

281
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,040
make a slightly more

282
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,080
complicated query that tells me go and look for

283
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,750
what it is or an instance or not a

284
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,110
subclass that at a distance of a star

285
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,610
we leave part or in a moment what

286
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,400
we feel  to do a couple of other

287
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,699
example queries to describe the system by

288
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:41,720
staying on easy things that

289
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,040
we all know

290
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,779
I know that it is worth asking what are the

291
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,029
provinces of Lombardy

292
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:49,769
then here maybe instead of saying

293
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:54,449
elements of colors let's say I

294
00:15:54,449 --> 00:16:02,639
like more and ask for c  'it is a province and an

295
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,329
instance of the element that represents the

296
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:08,819
provinces of Italy within a given wiki

297
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:11,120


298
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,300
and here I use the convenient thing of this

299
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,279
interface I don't need to

300
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,950
remember the code or to look

301
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,520
for it separately I can start writing it

302
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,459
press with more space and it gives me a

303
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:32,580
suggestion which is the right thing then I hope

304
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,110
that the province is an

305
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,959
administrative subdivision that the

306
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:45,349
property 131 but you do not go away

307
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,529
in q  he space in

308
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:52,650
lombardy I run has started to give me some

309
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,740
results tells me that in lombardy there

310
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,350
are eleven provinces that are

311
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,029
represented by these wiki codes

312
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:05,010
given this does not come back to me too much

313
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,949
this time too because in lombardy there

314
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:10,060
are 12 provinces

315
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,380
at least so we study a  school

316
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,439
[Music]

317
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,148
so what could have gone wrong

318
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:23,159
to understand it I use another

319
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,919
handy thing about this interface

320
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,980
which is the possibility to see

321
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,330


322
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,860
the beautiful pickwicks added in an almost automatic way that tell us

323
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,070
what these codes are because it is  true

324
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,990
I can click on it and find out what it

325
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,870
is but it is not very comfortable if I

326
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,480
add this line that

327
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,090
from here it is not too interesting to understand

328
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,100
now what it means exactly but

329
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,870
we can take it with a

330
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,030
magic string that they use every time it is

331
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,820
needed it is not automatically for  each

332
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,760
variable an associated variable

333
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,929
this type for here from province to

334
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:11,090
province label if asked to

335
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,210
select pro  wins and provinces the

336
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,980
beautiful with these things and he

337
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,429
executes the identifier luigi date we

338
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:25,570
see before but also the name of

339
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,980
what of what he represents and from

340
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,080
this it begins to be easier to understand

341
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,389
that what is missing is the province of

342
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:37,179
milan because  for some years they have

343
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:38,769
decided that it is no longer called the provinces of

344
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:41,739
milan but it is called 5 metropolitan of

345
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:43,799
milan

346
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:46,989
so if we want to understand it I

347
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:48,759
needed children to take what is

348
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:51,850
a province in Italy or a

349
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,419
metropolitan city of Italy

350
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,159
or it is done by enclosing these things

351
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:01,889
in the braces that using the word

352
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:05,630
union for which the province

353
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,110
is a is an instance of the province or

354
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,840
province is an instance of is an instance

355
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,980
si b

356
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,820
about the metropolitan of Italy

357
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,450
[Music]

358
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,200
a bit

359
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,190
at this point there are and I found

360
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,399
mine  two bikes and provinces and

361
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:42,149
metropolitan cities in Italy if now

362
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:45,149
I wanted

363
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,100
that even here we should know from

364
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,790
elementary school but surely

365
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,230
at least I would never remember by

366
00:19:54,230 --> 00:20:00,650
heart that it is  and for each region

367
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,320
you see how many provinces it contains they can

368
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,330
update the same in the same

369
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,980
way so I will take another

370
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,980
variable region and at this point I

371
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,030
put the label directly on it

372
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:19,749
will be these things I will have that the region

373
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:25,129
is an instance as with once  of

374
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:27,320
something that road will be called regions

375
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,439
of italy

376
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,710
region of italy the provinces have

377
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,990
these characteristics

378
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,060
and this in any case to the province for

379
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,900
the year in our

380
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,860
administrative division of lombardy on the

381
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,870
administrative design of the region

382
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,440
we try to execute the list of all

383
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,000
the provinces in euro  and the metropolitan cities

384
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,640
of italy and the region to which they belong

385
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,100
however i wanted to group them by

386
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,320
province so i will

387
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,809
elaborate this query further to

388
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:13,130
tell it to perrier to group them by

389
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:19,380
region as i do to a construct that

390
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:27,330
steals the region and region label because

391
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,809
that is the things  which must be the

392
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:33,240
same on both sides

393
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,000
and at this point can no longer use

394
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,860
qua pr  ovincia Provincia la bella because

395
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:45,200
the or because I'm doing the subscription

396
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,440
but what I want to have is to count the

397
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,509
number of provinces so such

398
00:21:56,509 --> 00:22:00,070
a thing

399
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,640
and here we are so what I did

400
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,250
is selecting me I was looking at

401
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,190
all the couples the groups  of region

402
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,140
label of the region that the same

403
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,940
thing and province group it to what

404
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,210
the same region and now there is this the

405
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,660
number of different provinces that

406
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,510
are inside maybe they can also

407
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:39,770
ruin it by number of number of

408
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:44,179
provinces and or my result  here too

409
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,910
I see something that does not add up but because

410
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,230
I have eighteen results in he will learn that the

411
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:57,710
regions in Italy were 20 and even the

412
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,990
numbers perhaps do not add up they do not

413
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,610
all return what does not work

414
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,520
there are two things 1 is that I said to

415
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,190
select the  regions but some things

416
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,250
are special status regions that

417
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,660
have another wiki data element

418
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,980
so I should do the same

419
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,059
speech I did here to

420
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:26,000
merge the regions as well  with a special statute and

421
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,290
then not all regions have

422
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,080
provinces Sicily has free and

423
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,970
free municipal consortia

424
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,610
so here I would have to add another

425
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,520
another case

426
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,040
and then another house still has the

427
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,250
friuli for which it becomes complicated a

428
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,530
little with other elements but which however

429
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,210
do not change do not

430
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,070
particularly change the substance

431
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,230
the last

432
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:58,510
example I wanted to do is a case a

433
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,320
query even a little more complicated

434
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,020
that

435
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,020
is false from the standard examples of

436
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,920
wiki data for which

437
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,260
the even pair even and there will also be  the

438
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,130
comments in English and it is the query a

439
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:21,540
query who goes to see which are the

440
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,290
main cities with the mayors who are

441
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,990
women who is one of the examples he

442
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,590
did also in the abstract of the

443
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,390
talk

444
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,550
this is a little more complicated let's try

445
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,410
to  run it intimate in the first place and

446
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:44,030
this gives me the top ten for

447
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,520
population because the limit to 10 makes sense

448
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,280
because there are several so better

449
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:57,380
so it would be long and painful to

450
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,110
calculate all or the city with

451
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,540
the label and the mayor and the label the

452
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,000
name of the mayor something I'm

453
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,630
doing

454
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:12,570
I'm doing a few things 1 compared to

455
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,900
what we knew the city

456
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,140
I'm taking a variable city that is

457
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,430
an instance of a city among other

458
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,080
things it has in common  this interface if I

459
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,550
pass on an identifier it tells me it

460
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,700
tells me what it is with a tweet tip and here

461
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,280
is what I said is needed in the case

462
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,780
of the star and the sun already

463
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,380
we have our p 31 which tells us

464
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,820
that it is  an instance of but also this

465
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,740
dance the 279 asterisk that is subclass

466
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,240
of this thing means that city must

467
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,960
be a subclass in a

468
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,790
subclass of a subclass how many

469
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,970
times we want something that at a

470
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,630
distance

471
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,220
that is that it must be an instance of something

472
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,270
that has  a subclass of a

473
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,770
subclass of a subclass how many

474
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,360
times we want of a city

475
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,309
and this is just the problem as before

476
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:21,010
what we should have done with the

477
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,690
sun is the same speech sun

478
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:29,160
p 31 dance the 279 asterisk and po  at the

479
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,750
distance of the star in that

480
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,970
way we had found it

481
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,360
then in the city the city I want to see

482
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,820
who is the mayor and I do this

483
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,780
using a general property in the head of the

484
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,020
government property but it

485
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,380
also applies in this case but here

486
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,100
we see a fixed gdp that  it is different from the

487
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,179
prefix w rites that we had seen before

488
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:58,710
this because we need roads

489
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,720
a little more information the inside

490
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,830
of the wiki given le it is true that I have this

491
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,950
structure in which there are the elements the

492
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,080
declarations with values but there

493
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,710
are also  much more information

494
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,310
that is

495
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,050
you have a value but then having for example

496
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,470
a source you can have qualifiers

497
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,220
that are other declarations

498
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,530
and a whole series of other

499
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,370
associated things these

500
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,620
go a little beyond the

501
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,020
simplified scheme that you said at the beginning but

502
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,330
in reality, however, they fall within

503
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,460
the same structure, there are models that are

504
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,030
modeled as triples subject

505
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,000
predicate object

506
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,580
that use elements  intermediates

507
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,450
for which in this case the object is not

508
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:59,430
the mayor but the object is the

509
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:03,390
declaration that that city has

510
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,720
this person as a single single mayor

511
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,190
this allows us to for example in

512
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,140
this case verify a

513
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,400
baker which is the end date

514
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,950
so make sure to rule out

515
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,690
cases where

516
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,370
what we are looking at is actually

517
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,570
no longer the mayor

518
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:32,929
this dam is what tells us the

519
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:36,740
mayor is a woman so pv 21 sex and

520
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,190
gender and this long thing

521
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:45,679
will be female and lastly we are

522
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,840
looking  what is the population of the

523
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,090
city with the property

524
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,050
1082

525
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,299
and

526
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,210
sorting

527
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,299
by the population in descending order

528
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:02,440
and taking the first ten and this is the

529
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,730
result

530
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,240
if we press them to the selection we

531
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,520
tighten from europe or italy to

532
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,289
say just add the relative the

533
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:19,950
relative  modification is right to

534
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,270
confirm that what I said before

535
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,470
is true if we take on the first those

536
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,080
we have seen that the one that

537
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,120
should make us find the sun but not

538
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,179
I did it now if I do the

539
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:36,899
same trick here as adding the

540
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:42,860
subclass of 279 what I want

541
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,140
at this point I find the sun I am 2

542
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:52,299
this is another problem but

543
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:55,710
let's leave it for another time

544
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,580
well then thanks lorenzo not there  it is time

545
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,380
for questions because we have still

546
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,980
overlooked the criticisms a little but I invite you to

547
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,930
participate in our telegram group

548
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,910
if anyone has more in-

549
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:16,360
depth questions or there will be

550
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,250
a way to turn the tele admits the

551
