1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,819
thank you what to say about me of course

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,580
this talk I am a tonic who does

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,910
things the sound systems or a

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,400
company called car tender that deals

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,250
with charging systems developed our

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,840
product

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,820
the splendor making nothing since

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,660
we are here I see many curious makers

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,230
I wanted  tell you a little about how to

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,640
do pcb and electronic things

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,820
thanks to the new services that have

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,950
sprung up in recent months this

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,250
tone which is sponsored by gl c pc bsd

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,719
please

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,190
click subscribe and target notifications and

16
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,170
briefly you will blow up graphs of

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,309
yes because the site precisely this

18
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:06,840
service that at the beginning a few years ago

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,799
begins the spreading of

20
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,610
very basic renzi foods very low and

21
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,670
recently from I think three months has

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,900
also begun assembly asterius and also

23
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,140
the rest extremely competitive as a

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,860
series therefore 10 20 and  30 its limit

25
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,340
is 20 pieces or 50 but what is a pcb is a

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,119
pcb is an electronic circuit is a

27
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,049
model of the mafias a pc is a

28
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,640
fiber base  of glass where

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,329
copper is deposited in menus from where

30
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,979
taxes are engraved that connect the

31
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,470
best various components that are

32
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,540
present and above this copper

33
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,020
is then deposited a layer of a

34
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,969
state of soller masks that this case

35
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,360
to isolate the dramas that you avoid  it was

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,540
discovered pitfalls places had to have

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,819
probed the components so expensive and

38
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,560
we will find for example the choke of

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,129
this switch that was mounted

40
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:24,690
on this circuit

41
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,190
this circuit later very

42
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,140
simple if we can order it in 20 minutes of

43
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,050
food thanks to this

44
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,769
our effect then here  i did in

45
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:41,780
alloy free strip

46
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,200
ok here we go to our faithful eagle

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,440
unfortunately use key card because they were neither

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,200
time nor desire to repair it still not

49
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,690
methane a little nest it is not said that

50
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,190
in my first love todolist i will do

51
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,410
what can be done with i  pc of in addition to the

52
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,180
circuits remain a very

53
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,620
interesting thing also prizes that in

54
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,330
signaling why a pcb precisely an

55
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:15,440
object rig  ido send us rigid sheet metal

56
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,900
that can be cut into shapes of

57
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,680
any shape even very precise and

58
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,200
very robust so not only to make 53

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,940
tranesi but also for many other things

60
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,410
that the invented powers

61
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,670
will show you only an example of

62
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,920
this even if in reality a  electronic circuit

63
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,550


64
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,440
then for example the rest here

65
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,269
is a strange black part and that you see

66
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:49,790
dark compared to the gray one the

67
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,670
shape that the final pc will have this is

68
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,049
a folder in an adapter for a

69
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,290
thermal camera like this this

70
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,239
thermal camera that must be connected

71
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,799
unfortunately I don't have it under the phone

72
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:06,609
here because I was at all the

73
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:08,719
political office in Verona the rest of

74
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,280
the technical room that goes under the

75
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,549
phone with this while I video sb in

76
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:16,430
my case but if it says I drive while

77
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,220
the camera from the employer or  from usb

78
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,509
16 liter and then enter the phone risking

79
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,280
to break the connectors every time he

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,449
touched the camera and

81
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:30,740
this system invented a bit

82
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,680
mac  inoso with two adapters

83
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,889
no because not the risk at home so

84
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:43,060
we lose a usb micro usb

85
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,909
connector for the camera which is

86
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,530
then housed below more nor on two

87
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,159
scars to put on some cable ties

88
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:55,039
to fix the camera mesh and here

89
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,800
another micro url connector which then  I can

90
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,380
use a cable to attach a pc or

91
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,610
phone an author from usb also in

92
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,020
this case it is hands with mechanical support

93
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,970
that I also made the latest news it is

94
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,159
so much to make it clothespin a

95
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:18,530
sucker the precision is very high

96
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,080
so let's go to the weights of the sun

97
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,120
of mm  so really you can do a lot of

98
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,550
interesting and bad things

99
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,320
on the other we can turn it on they

100
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,159
discovered for example it is soldering the

101
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,349
boards creating structure me thrill is

102
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:38,120
mario with him i can save two boards

103
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,490
for example so in order to create

104
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,190
something more dimensional you can do

105
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,409
your imagination and the connection between

106
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:51,409
these objects is very simple

107
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,809
absolute go also very

108
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:55,759
simple s warm  and it is sold abroad very

109
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:03,349
shortly and then here we see another

110
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:07,369
pcb for example this is the snb channel

111
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:13,669
usa which is a competition between who is good at

112
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:19,279
saving in the sense this bike of

113
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,129
all these components here is who is

114
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:23,989
able to save this object  in the

115
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:25,069
shortest possible time it

116
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:29,889
wins it seems big enough but this

117
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,379
in total about the size of a

118
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:41,329
two euro coin 20 16

119
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:44,149
just to have some visions and this

120
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,369
is the smallest component to be welded

121
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:50,259
which should be

122
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,500
about half a millimeter by half a

123
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,139
millimeter in size this you can

124
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,699
to imagine that it is quite difficult,

125
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,250
however, fortunately on the angri to

126
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,479
help our Chinese friends

127
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,389
and so to show a bit of the

128
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:16,349
process of how all this takes place

129
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:19,139
I thought of recovering this

130
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,979
project that the project of the

131
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,819
brooch that just showed and

132
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,990
brought into the new millennium and

133
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,699
therefore to discover a project they had

134
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,349
made regressions in mastiano in 2018 and it was

135
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:38,250
a bit even let's say a minute r  ialzo

136
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,190
as scooter on how to save those as

137
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,039
you can see we have components with many

138
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,159
reasons why components arrange

139
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,800
warhol compliment means that they

140
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,900
have legs that we can start

141
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,650
these holes and then it will be welded

142
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,629
on the other side opposite to the contrary

143
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:59,610
in the smd which are the ones that  we have

144
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,779
seen in the previous one where the merits must be

145
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,289
supported instead they are exalted that

146
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:10,050
conventionally of the

147
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:16,349
industrial process having the virgin pcb above

148
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:19,430
there is a mask and well applied a

149
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,490
steel mask is perforated had to

150
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,569
deposit the tin is spatulated in

151
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:30,930
a state of a stagnant paste in the

152
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,539
of tin program and the button

153
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,789
of the foreigner and not deposited only

154
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,708
ipads that were welded

155
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,860
then the pcb goes through the maximum

156
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,539
of back pick and place that you take the

157
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,540
components and the squares in the places where they

158
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,160
go

159
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,440
and then but in an oven

160
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,710
where the strange deposited  the

161
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,960
strange paste that has been deposited in the various

162
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,100
pubs melts and is

163
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,490
therefore to be welded complete with  we see that this

164
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,890
service allows us to look like only

165
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,230
asmd components we convert this pcb

166
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:16,660
to use the components briefly as

167
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,300
we also do a small excursus on

168
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,510
how to use eagle

169
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,950
this is the Tuscan schematic of

170
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,600
we see that there is the battery connected

171
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,720
the switch in series  at 5 land how

172
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,540
should I remain the existence of limitation

173
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,290
and a stage with battery holder

174
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,620
these here I think are for the guns from for

175
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,260
sel com

176
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,700
so the battery the bottle holder

177
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,860
will leave and what is already will

178
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,590
replace only the resistors

179
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:01,420
well we could incriminate them we fear  the

180
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,180
roads this resistance and we are going to

181
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,760
add a component with this I

182
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,320
use books to reuse bis pad fan

183
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,130
but we see we

184
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,510
choose a nice fsm of this levels

185
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:28,149
from fruit we see a 12 0 6 which

186
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:32,709
means 12 mayors of paul 706 lecci

187
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:36,579
inches of looks and  let's go and place it

188
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:38,200
here you see that it

189
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,190
automatically connects to the max

190
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,100
negative signal of the technique then we come from

191
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,560
adds a res  existence instead from the

192
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:58,709
library in the direction and existence

193
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:06,699
03 05 feel in the square ok he had made

194
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,149
the connections also of the resistance

195
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:12,399
we go to the tc there and we see that

196
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,329
a led has disappeared

197
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,690
and has been replaced by these two

198
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,530
components here the others do not do the

199
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,520
same thing but

200
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,230
andor  infamous simply so that they

201
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:34,480
remain in that position then re

202
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,430
place

203
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:41,710
08 05 taq taq taq taq the same thing for

204
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,010
the werder

205
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:50,670
we go back to buy the one from before

206
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,410
12 06

207
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:03,740
bart has changed existence he has not

208
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,139
changed the leds as never I have clicked

209
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:09,259
on  ok has not published on the website of the

210
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:16,999
green so 1 2 3 4 and in fact the only

211
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:20,839
paths ok allowed on the

212
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,889
back year we see we have twelve minutes it

213
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:29,240
is ok we should succeed we move to the

214
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,790
layer above we obviously reciprocate two

215
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,959
yesterday but above not below so the

216
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,610
above part  night under the pc and reality

217
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,759
we could also have some interiors but in

218
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,970
this case we keep things simple

219
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:52,999
ok this is back with damato of the

220
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:55,279
brooch in reality maybe the  just as

221
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:02,389
weapons against if we give everything ok we are going

222
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,699
to put the leder back too the warnings

223
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:10,009
ter point that he should go here I will do it

224
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:15,220
and to the connections

225
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:21,679
then let's go and see what

226
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,879
the auto router advises us

227
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:40,230
it

228
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,560
doesn't matter too much

229
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:55,269
and so in the world of the house  alright

230
00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:01,260
let's do them quickly from the bottom we

231
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:06,730
press for a mind very often

232
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:12,579
tell why are all the links to

233
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:14,410
that bad stuff were gone turn the

234
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,790
things we do to them nava montas

235
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,970
asked what even if the pedestrians

236
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,380
ourselves right now

237
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,010
so

238
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:43,770
ok this here is this  here we did

239
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,019
this is in china the positive

240
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:51,470
was here and this with this therefore

241
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,759
the battery was

242
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,079
at the switch out

243
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,749
of the switch was at all the

244
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:59,179
common resistors this is enough for me this

245
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:02,660
this area this existence

246
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,410
on the other side

247
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,230
all  the single landers that the other side

248
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,000
of the bed from the big one why not them

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,070
those who are connected and already all

250
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,640
together we make a board this in front

251
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,490
they are already at levels activated together by the

252
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,230
ground plan in

253
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:26,860
fact both false pepe and the big one is

254
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,940
already connected to all the other big

255
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,890
this server yes because sanchez is on this side

256
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,200
and gets to the big battery that is

257
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,740
this

258
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,430
ok well my son I don't know pcb no  but

259
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,060
also a fundamental thing

260
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:52,350
we are going to modify it they have finally

261
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,690
found a range of saving to

262
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,400
produce 11 small servers

263
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,600
we have to make a general gerber and

264
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,240
use an ebook cancer if process which is

265
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,160
this little program that generates

266
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,240
a series of files side

267
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,380
if c  'it is a file of the first surface

268
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,800
past messages that arrive when

269
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,860
not when they come fridge ok so

270
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,670
this is a copper top so the copper

271
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,860
which, however, deposited on the top surface

272
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,350


273
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,480
this is the copper sheepskin so the

274
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,990
part had to roads you boast land the

275
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,820
profile the  sand mask so we had to

276
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,250
where it will be open in it must stop for you

277
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,220
in the wind that the blue will not be visited in

278
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,780
this case the bottom and the sic screen

279
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,480
top and bottom

280
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,709
ok on the must the names usually re

281
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:02,079
delete yes hybrid deleted and leave there

282
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,559
because it's okay so we

283
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:09,250
export vip so we can

284
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,679
save it with a dom prophete

285
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,839
we choose where to save it pin screen and

286
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:20,290
18 are ok we keep the folder here and then

287
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,390
in france but they are also  two things we

288
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,699
lack

289
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:26,410
the instructions for the machine where to

290
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,910
place the components so we do

291
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:35,320
expo fi the export not from smd

292
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,910
too much and they have a tube back close

293
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,070
also the bonne which is the list of

294
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,820
competitors

295
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,340
so not only schematic we leave

296
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,120
export com 12 minutes in ok  if

297
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,679
we can do it

298
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:54,250
we remember for the values of the asset tests

299
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,700
of the resistances if also an ss16 and

300
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,500
we study it it says here

301
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,160
now I have made a program chosen

302
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,680
to prepare these files but in reality

303
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:13,160
it does nothing but move

304
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,330
the columns of the csv  then manage

305
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,439
let's see how to do it

306
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,080
we come to the last one as you like how it

307
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,240
needs data then we take with on

308
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,910
board we take where we have generated but

309
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:40,140
a top coat motor and  csv

310
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,470
I generated me from bomber place ok

311
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,020
let's go to jellici this beautiful

312
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,190
site I was talking about tells us pc of punto com

313
00:18:49,190 --> 00:19:00,210
as there are no news ok they are from nikon

314
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,740
and staff

315
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,300
and here we are

316
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,460
and now and to get a

317
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,380
quote we must not load them

318
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,200
spiller the  our fi inserted with the

319
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,300
carnet and the various things

320
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,300
here we see two layers could

321
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,880
always be four of the interiors 1 the

322
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,130
dimensions the quantity you can make a

323
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,460
nice tone when you need different had

324
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,760
we are interested in the thickness of the pcd'i and can

325
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,790
go to 42 mm the standard  in point 6

326
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,900
meanwhile it is clear that it is already

327
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,540
addressed how our

328
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,460
product note will be ok the color of the foods

329
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,910
for assembly can only be done inter

330
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,380
therefore we are forced to stay on the

331
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:06,380
burden the rent of the loan and that can

332
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,230
be done with the  two streams

333
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,580
we don't care I like lead

334
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,690
these prototypes and we can re-

335
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,940
test the blood test so we turn on

336
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,710
this tip let's say we want to

337
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,930
assemble x it may seem like just a la  to

338
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,030
so we looked like the

339
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,010
lower side where you see that it will provide us with

340
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,770
resistances we can make 5 or

341
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,340
this hard or we could produce

342
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:40,610
closer ok hell

343
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,440
here is an option to pringles

344
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,320
practically the machine and the api campeis

345
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,680
that various components father up  to the world

346
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,370
and sales of the plexus the machine that goes

347
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,810
to drag comparative install

348
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,280
components needs to believe in it some

349
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,590
holes for reference

350
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,900
I have let it recreate gel and there

351
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,970
will be a bit of disgust because it is what here

352
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,710
we are all at war and therefore I have not

353
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,730
tried  to do anything in advance because

354
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,370
it has not given a value to things it does not go

355
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,040
with value to things

356
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,350
so I will show you the truth I

357
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:29,960
expect the files place not even a

358
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,390
good name of the component you have given to the

359
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,590
pcb and civilians owe it to the xy center that

360
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,480
you  it was installed and as it is noticed

361
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,659
while what interests us who

362
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:46,640
had the problem is the bonne ok because

363
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,390
you are not a god and so let's put big

364

and 100 for their putl  ia di natale

in the fridge but save it let's put it back

00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:22,390
let's see if it takes we feel caught

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,080
automatically have my choice of resistance from

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,020
100 eaten 05 like the one he

371
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,520
placed and which leather and vision of

372
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,560
selected because he did not find it

373
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:51,680
we search for all the components that

374
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,920
can then be installed on

375
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,890
them and you can find them smtp live then

376
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,690
tablets of the rest when the list of

377
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,360
components that can stimulate you because

378
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,250
obviously they cannot assemble all

379
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,070
the municipalities in the world but they are common types

12 10 that sucks

385
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,540
oh well emiliano alberto 05 it was trichological

386
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,300
zero is used to beat up the same

387
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,080
let's take these at random that are

388
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,860
running are let's see these are theirs

389
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,040
even if the iran yellow and green and

390
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,900
you see  who read read grayed out because he

391
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,510
sees that the footprint is different but if

392
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,870
elected the same then I do an inspiration he

393
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,130
tells me where he put them

394
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,490
here you see that the LEDs are turned 90

395
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:58,920
degrees so I will have to go only wines

in reality already only world so I have to do

398
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,860
the same because there are the Chinese people who

399
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,700
check them before making you but they are

400
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,470
always too scrupulous and I have always

401
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,780
turned them correctly  as if they

402
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:18,600
were expecting it then rotation I expect

403
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,450
p 90 degrees

404
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,920
between all the

405
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:35,140

reload takes very well

what has

409
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:03,320
been combined the wrong one has been loaded next he does

not like

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,230
this interesting he does not like it

412
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,940
because he saved it badly

413
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,670
openoffice calc so

414
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:40,650
let's see  if this is anyway once we

415
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:45,210
have made money we do this

416
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,460
briefly let them say the same
