1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,750
before starting, yes, thank you so me

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,970
mister bit of data but above all I am in

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,039
transport engineering and therefore I use the

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,120
data precisely for my

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,259
professional activity and therefore today I wanted to

6
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,389
talk to you a little about how a project that I

7
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,820
started a little while and today in short the

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,830
I bring a couple of examples but I hope in the

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,380
near future sorry maybe next

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,480
year in les that it will be definitively

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,840
ready but I hope even before how I

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,900
used a couple of packets of

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,340
python precisely to extract

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,390
road damage essentially therefore of

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,940
road technologies and analyze them in the

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,690
form of a network  here is the title hicks

17
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,399
dictated yesterday but now

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,140
you will understand where it derives from where it derives

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,030
from it is so much from the two magnetic that I will

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,809
present the first one is called usm nx and

21
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,030
second networks so here you see that

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,329
the aic disappear both let's say the

23
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,000
first is essentially a package

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,519
born to very easily extract data

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,460
from open street maps and analyze them in the

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,070
form of a network and above  all in the form

27
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,530
of graph therefore of a complex system and

28
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,840
here that the networking aics deal intervenes

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,930
that somehow go

30
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,830
quiet packages go to work

31
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,360
together and therefore integrate very well

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,040
in my opinion now we will then see a couple

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,310
of examples and let's start first from  networking

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,020
sure that the older one let's say from

35
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,659
today we have reached version 2.5

36
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,619
so but unstable and born many years ago

37
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:38,880
with the first versions it was a little

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,040
really raw but now let's say that it

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,220
is mature enough for data analysis and

40
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,909
especially complex direct and can

41
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,040
do anything  then build the scratches for

42
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,500
those who are familiar with complex systems

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,540
compact networks if we say that

44
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,020


45
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,600
the first python package is a bit there that one can

46
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,820
trivialize I am going to analyze lauti and to

47
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,049
use if I have to find a small

48
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,450
defect for now and if we have given

49
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,190
the  very large structures and a bit

50
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,459
slow in that case usually you switch to

51
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:14,410
a more advanced package called

52
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,739
the gra  fo but we will talk about it alone next

53
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:18,400
time

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,620
we say it to start anyway to

55
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,260
analyze structures quite also

56
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,700
quite complex however complex roll and

57
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,110
above all because it is easy to

58
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,459
use

59
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,250
what it does and this therefore

60
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,440
allows you to build read export

61
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,390
and import do a bit of everything with the

62
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,329
scratches to the nets then to the left or

63
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:39,069
rather than to the right after precisely

64
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:40,900
thanks to the possibility of integration

65
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,390
with float lim for example it allows you to

66
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,930
color the arches according to

67
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,670
different different structures that we have

68
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,370
inside weights etc. and above all to

69
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,720
let you also do direct analysis  and

70
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,120
therefore we have example histograms on the

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,569
degree of a network rather than

72
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,959
belgrade distributions of the network

73
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,389
so essentially how many nodes

74
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,400
have a certain type of connections with

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,090
the at the other indices are very

76
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,239
basic outputs and networking allows you

77
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,480
to do a lot of procedures instead usm

78
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,739
knicks  in fact it was born a few years ago and

79
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,359
naturally fre  and here we have

80
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:25,120
abel's page it was invented by del Signore

81
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,000
ce of going like the planes that

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,069
essentially this package was structured

83
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:33,880
to make his own

84
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,170
very interesting study which are called

85
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,540
cue this state network orientation

86
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,090
is practically him thanks to this

87
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,370
extracted package  all types

88
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,940
of road networks quite around the

89
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,190
world and to analyze a little

90
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,590
statistically the different orientations

91
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,769
for example here there are some

92
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,609
cities we have above all the

93
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:59,109
American cities that we have the usual cardo and

94
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:01,630
therefore decumano north south east west very

95
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,150
very basic and  instead others that if they

96
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,620
have structures a little more

97
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,540
precisely distributed in a manner

98
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,939
and from here we say precisely released

99
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:14,189
this package that allows you to make

100
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,060
interesting analyzes even at the

101
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,160
level of complex networks

102
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,930
analysis so for example here we have

103
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,690
a road network topology see the

104
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,389
colors are proportional to st metric

105
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,970
is called be  tween us centrality that

106
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,030
practically a metric that is precisely

107
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,500
each node let's say the red award therefore

108
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,840
greater than more in the central than

109
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,759
means most of the minimum paths between

110
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,560
all the pairs of nodes that

111
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,120
cross precisely that node gravestones

112
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,740
understand a little centrality of north

113
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,830
rather than analyzing the famous

114
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,050
isochronous and therefore the areas where

115
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,530
we say is are passable with the

116
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,210
same travel time therefore for

117
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,630
example yellow etc. from the center to

118
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,289
the outside below where underneath a

119
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:04,060
road map of god for been caught

120
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,250
and I told you that this is  born to make a

121
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,050
project a little more let's say inherent

122
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,509
to my professional activity I am

123
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,270
seen to cut too much but let

124
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,280
's say the idea is to restructure

125
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,039
a road network that exported

126
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,229
dop and street maps very easily and I go to

127
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:22,389
assign it weights that are given by the

128
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,430
flows  let's say internal costs of

129
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,080
time to go for example from one

130
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,760
city to another for example from the city

131
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,780
to  city of qom and domodossola where

132
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,580
the user can choose different

133
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,830
routes according to the cost essentially of the

134
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,820
time it takes to travel or therefore

135
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,520
in some way for example from abi

136
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,620
we have tenders the variable times

137
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,400
where xl according to the flow therefore

138
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
more traffic there  it is obviously very

139
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,150
intuitively even more time

140
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,880
maybe I can take it to cover

141
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,389
that stretch

142
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,880
so somehow it will make

143
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,349
a sort of direct balance in which

144
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:01,449
I go to look for an excellent system and an

145
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:03,280
excellent one indeed especially for the user who is

146
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,770
looking in some way  always

147
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,479
personal experience you don't know it I think better than

148
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:09,430
me when he attacked your

149
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,560
navigator he went to look for the

150
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,650
path with the best time

151
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,479
coherence this let's say a bit the idea

152
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,470
and now I open we always see they ask

153
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,919
sebastiano for confirmation if you see yes  the

154
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,759
world is very good the famous notebook chip

155
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,039
of the notebook to show you

156
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,020
practically a little bit how

157
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,770
the two ev packages work  they are imported

158
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,229
very classically with this

159
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:42,699
this syntax then the idea is

160
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:44,710
starting from network hicks as I told you it

161
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,900
is very very very easy to create

162
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,530
networks above we create a demo network and

163
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,870
you can clearly see a graph

164
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,850
directed in some way when I say

165
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,070
graph  direct means that I am going to

166
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,990
define a direction of travel itself or

167
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,300
for example the road case

168
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,669
we can obviously have

169
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:08,050
two-way roads in that case it

170
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,690
could simply be a graph or

171
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,610
rather a direct graph but with two

172
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,289
directions of travel therefore from a  on the

173
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:17,289
other hand by too many and the nodes and then

174
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:19,449
I go to add simply with a

175
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,060
very basic form I leave out of

176
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,990
the dictionary lists the ok marks between one no of

177
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,060
another that I define the

178
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,949
origin node and the starting

179
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,900
node sorry for the node in  I arrive and then I

180
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,060
define some weights here I have entered the

181
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,159
time for example of travel setup at

182
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,590
zero and a cost that can be this

183
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,449
moment or what you want p  roprio

184
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:43,960
adhering to let's say a weighted network I can

185
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,570
then grace network hicks give and also to the

186
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,940
flight of the others the other attributes

187
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,460
in this case septum to the gip graph

188
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,470
previously defined the value zero

189
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,630
as another weight this case flow

190
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,720
disguises the flow of dean of people or

191
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,150
of vehicles that go from one down to

192
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,539
the other and if then simply precisely

193
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:07,810
to our metrics that tell me but the

194
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,490
size of our network

195
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,979
that I am going to define this case we

196
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:17,199
have 9 sorry we have 9

197
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,780
sorry 55 49 55 five arches

198
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,650
there  I said before that it is very easy to

199
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,040
integrate it with

200
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,089
display packs with me

201
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:34,520
matt cutts book that somehow is

202
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,950
integrated within networking

203
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,229
if in this case then I can define

204
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:42,380
a layout president spring is a kind

205
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,460
of playout that goes a bit to position  the

206
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,890
nodes as a function of the repulsion

207
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,000
between the rare three of them gold between their

208
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
arches that are connected and then I go to

209
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,470
define various things point let's say

210
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,210
prettam  graphic body for which you already see

211
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,470
also in some way it can have a

212
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,240
first visualization with also the

213
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,640
nice one that shows me the direction it

214
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,550
has from which to the arc from one node to another

215
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,210


216
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,000
then we say in output that the various the

217
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,830
various fields that there are  in the tech

218
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,930
field in the text field they are the coordinates

219
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,270
of the positioning appropriations of the

220
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,089
nodes after a visual thing I can

221
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:22,760
obviously use the coordinates for example in the real test phase

222
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,460


223
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,070
rather than the coordinates from between 0

224
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,730
and 2 1 and where I can define a

225
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,230
topology like this  of graphics but in short, not

226
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,300
on a graphic level it does not really matter very much

227
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,060


228
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,720
[Applause]

229
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,220
let's just start analyzing a little bit

230
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,330
the network ips functions which

231
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,550
within the simplest level of algorithms

232
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,770
is that of the

233
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,570
minimum path as I said so a chance

234
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,200
of spaces that  goes on to simply

235
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,209
define it as find me the shortest path

236
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:58,970
between node to node of however

237
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,160
following the weight therefore of the cost no

238
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,770
therefore not only  at least the length but

239
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,920
going to define the cost that I have

240
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,330
fixed on the arch in this case it gives me

241
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,360
the acid pattern if instead I say ok to

242
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,709
find me only the minimum path

243
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,670
regardless of the weight therefore in b it is

244
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,890
true to find clothes other than

245
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,540
simply the minimum path  number

246
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,120
of jumps that I do one of the nabis

247
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,250
going to export the what's

248
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,990
inside the graph structure

249
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,440
level of the proper arc

250
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,630
and agis data through to this structure

251
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,170
here then or simply a sort of

252
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,370
list somehow condition

253
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,680
inserted in where  or the pairs of

254
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,020
pilots and inside the dictionaries that

255
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,270
tell me that the weights or gods were worth the various

256
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,540
values between thrones and between each pair of

257
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,270
rock

258
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,500
then we say this at the base so

259
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,140
this simply serves to make us

260
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,180
our direct analyzes but let's see

261
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,210
precisely  how can smx exploits these things

262
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,190
to instead have a simple abstraction

263
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,800
from open city but it is also going to

264
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,360
analyze it or the result of a network form

265
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,970
then since you  I love here in san donà and

266
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,270
that we have excellent baits 2020 that

267
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,530
hosts us we do a small

268
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,280
example on this on this on this

269
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,130
city then and also here the pregnant the

270
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,750
syntax is very simple so o hicks

271
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,350
grand place then as the first camp

272
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,040
I went  to simply enter the

273
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,540
denomination that the open street map mila

274
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,220
di san donato is ideal so be careful that

275
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,860
you should try to take them increases

276
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,770
even writing only san donà di piave it

277
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,700
works between let's say if we go to

278
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,710
specify better after all the fields

279
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,740
that open street map defines for san

280
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,650
donà  di piave are safer and instead

281
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,600
network type drive

282
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,580
this is a subset of what

283
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,460
can be extracted free of topology that

284
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,170
defines me only precisely the roads in

285
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,060
which they are somehow used for

286
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,680
the movement of vehicles

287
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,800
here commented a part below that

288
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,230
where I  says the projection on

289
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,800
utm coordinates now let's leave it alone but it is useful

290
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,260
for those who make maps or otherwise dalisi

291
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,880
ge  to know that somehow

292
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,330
later it is possible to project onto other

293
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,339
spatial coordinates with the usual 10 problems

294
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:25,580
and distance etc.

295
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,850
now this is what he strikes me

296
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,380
depends on the hard from dark and city I want to

297
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,480
go and extract but let's say it takes

298
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,870
a moment extract from open  street map

299
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,170
the typology even here with the graf blog

300
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,010
I can make a very simple dish

301
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,259
of mine

302
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:47,109
this obviously also for those who are not but

303
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:48,759
in short sebastiano will

304
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:52,749
surely recognize it as san donà di piave and the

305
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:55,720
topology ok so with nodes and arches and

306
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,290
here open smx stick  sorry very loudly

307
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,359
because that is he greatly simplifies

308
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:04,089
what can be the exit from a little

309
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:05,739
street map which is usually a

310
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:07,389
rather complicated thing

311
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:09,819
at the level of nodes and arcs of points

312
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:12,759
and lines that connect them because it

313
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,069
already simplifies a lot  the

314
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:16,720
topology for which I have a network let's say

315
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,039
much simpler than what

316
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:21,669
could be the one that if the former

317
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:23,229
between them directly dop and street map

318
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:25,539
would have a number level of nodes

319
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,100
and points very very very very much

320
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,559
greater that in the end they could

321
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,689
really usually not serve me but only

322
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:34,059
to weigh down my graph a little

323
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:41,679
then if ok yes what we have to

324
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,129
do now as we did before

325
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:47,619
in the  case of a demo network go to

326
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,230
understand what is the minimum

327
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,600
draw course between this location here of the grand

328
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,910
slam in the east and there is already the yellow

329
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,230
choice precisely because it was an

330
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,839
extreme point and I needed to make an example

331
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,819
between  the other 6 bar is already there is the municipality of

332
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,699
san dona vico for me I remember then it is a

333
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:06,459
municipal of mazda is the municipality of taggia has

334
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:08,109
as it says play so if we were

335
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:09,399
right on the border but just

336
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,709
taking a thousand the whole network we

337
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,059
managed

338
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:15,429
you will go ruby  both in what centers

339
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,999
so entry normally it happened I

340
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:23,019
see myself in the ball to understand or three screens and

341
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:26,049
ok thanks then I said to define

342
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:27,819
the locations then I go to

343
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:30,429
simply define latitude

344
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:32,350
longitude a of the east then  the big

345
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,539
clubs and already says that somehow

346
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,459
chosen a more or less central point in the

347
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,350
country we don't have to worry about

348
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,999
putting the coordinates too

349
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:45,310
precise because

350
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,050
because thanks just again or smx

351
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,880
I can take me I say ok take me my

352
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,600
way of origin from gartner eastwood

353
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,830
of the east so he takes this

354
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,360
coordinate that more or less exactly this

355
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,070
building where we are now

356
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,050
and he takes me the node that he knows we

357
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,870
have extracted from the open street map

358
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,940
closest to the coordinates that

359
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,560
I gave him so he finds

360
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,630
however lyon point of the graph that is

361
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,630
closest to the node the graphic and is

362
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,040
closest to the exact coordinates

363
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,910


364
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,040
so also for the north destination

365
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,250
which, as we said, has gone down and

366
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,430
then a mo again to tell him ok ruth

367
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,660
finds mila the shortest path  queer

368
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,670
absent profuse that of network ips

369
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,100
you see I tell him ok in my graphology

370
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,080
node note source node shave

371
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,300
destination so as I think I simply tell you

372
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,740
the  length so

373
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,510
obviously he taking the nets from the open

374
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,440
street map will be

375
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,360
when the ugoni or of archi then

376
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,760
resumes the minimum path that goes here

377
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,460
now we are helping better and for

378
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,839
inside and san donà and then he takes the road

379
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,630
and we arrive we arrive this gadget

380
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,089
quite still trivial let's say

381
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:56,170
relatively because in any case it gives me a

382
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,730
cartographic projection not bad

383
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,660
if instead I would like to go as in

384
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,910
my idea of the project go to understand a

385
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,400
little about the part of the difficult traffic and

386
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,470
therefore of the travel time

387
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,170
I have to do a little more I have

388
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,460
to do I have to actually go and see that

389
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,320
what my database that extracted from

390
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,910
open street map how did the work

391
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,400
this is a piece of what he

392
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,339
extracted you see that there are fields

393
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,050
that have been filled in

394
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,910
by those who have entered the

395
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,700
information in the open street map  and many

396
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,380
are empty and fewer so for

397
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,600
example of the part in addition to geometry or

398
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,010
the number of lanes

399
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,140
there is a bridge if  it is an intersection

400
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,589
etc. the maximum city are are

401
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,080
null in this case however it is on

402
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,360
the other side the name of the streets and above all the

403
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,830
length that sky because in that

404
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,600
of fundamental however from this little

405
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,050
information I can already give

406
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,690
thanks again to opera awards m knicks  some

407
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,070
additional information for example

408
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,449
I can tell him ok for each

409
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:01,149
type of road is that

410
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:03,309
I can associate it with residential secondary tertiary

411
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:05,980
so do a mobbing of the speeds of

412
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,679
kilometers per hour which in my opinion are

413
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,630
those can be speed limits

414
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,029
rather than there are certain

415
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:15,189
zones 30  no so the low speed

416
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,829
I can assign them to the if every single

417
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,439
road category and after the the

418
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,809
interesting thing that I go to the ok to ex

419
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,510
pip so it somehow

420
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,159
fills me all the fields that I did not have

421
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:30,580
therefore aims database go social a

422
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,279
field that is  speed then speed and

423
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,840
based on the speed and

424
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,730
length of each arc menia calculates

425
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,429
precisely this  at the extreme the times of

426
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,889
automatically calculates the speed it is

427
00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:43,480
called free flow so if there

428
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,700
was no one follow if

429
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,440
simply chasing the speed that I have

430
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,510
marked then speed limit and

431
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,889
travel that length

432
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:54,070
obviously it would take a certain time and

433
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,539
then that to  this point

434
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:58,510
my database after frame becomes so that it

435
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,799
is the one before but you can see that I have

436
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:02,860
added to the right of the surveyors column

437
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,380
a speed that the one defined by mac

438
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,200
colmar ping and in internet time that

439
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
there has been calculated directly from the

440
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,690
package to this  point the

441
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,049
interesting thing that I can do 222 ruth

442
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:19,690
so the first that the first one

443
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,370
stupidly weighed the distance only the

444
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,919
second that instead the date on the

445
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,500
travel time and then this case I'm going to

446
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,710
make the plot of the two roots

447
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,049
so we give the red is that  of before

448
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,480
that used to collect on the distance that

449
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,610
facts pass me through the center of

450
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,669
san donà the second instead of that

451
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,019
ap  minor time point

452
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,110
obviously years ago the road at speed

453
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,510
where the allowed speeds are

454
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,190
greater so I still use a

455
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,880
shorter time and the last piece is and as

456
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,519
a obviously ok this point is only a

457
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,260
piece of what you can do

458
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,320
then the  The idea is to integrate

459
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,090
all these parts the most difficult thing

460
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,779
is to aim for many fields that the west of here

461
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:07,080
does not know depends on heaps of

462
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,960
let's go and analyze between let's

463
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,120
go and set up further fields that can

464
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,940
be the capacity of the road that is

465
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,399
how many vehicles per hour  it can

466
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:19,200
endure before it gets clogged

467
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,600
somehow speaking very trivially and

468
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,190
above all also the saturation therefore the

469
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,840
ratio between the vehicles that

470
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,600
really pass with the data of the analysis that

471
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,179
statistics and the capacity so if

472
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,830
we are over an hour while we are in the queue

473
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,830
we are stopped ok and  on the basis of

474
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,649
these values also per user then it is

475
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:38,700
also simply based on the

476
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,799
information that you could have from a

477
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,480
navigator when ab  We have a

478
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,000
saturated stretch rather than closed obviously

479
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,210
looking for a path a speed path

480
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,669
with a shorter time and where you can then

481
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:53,250
travel and therefore there are a few

482
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,899
things to do especially just to give

483
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:57,389
and analyze a function that tells me

484
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:59,669
ok that gives me the actual time  of

485
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,139
travel before we

486
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:02,880
simply set the time and the basis of

487
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,169
speed and space

488
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,480
but the idea is to go to understand

489
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,549
that as the road arch

490
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:14,580
increases in flow, consequently my

491
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,440
travel time increases according to a

492
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,929
law  which could be like this is

493
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:20,580
a bit empirical but it is the one that more or

494
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,730
less is used in engineering and this is

495
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,380
precisely the idea is what I am

496
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,419
developing and maybe next year it

497
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,029
may be here to present a

498
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:36,679
more advanced and Greek or finished package
