1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
I am remind you of the contest that are
going on

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,080
everyone if you can go actual a quick
wizard one because it's blocking

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:18,960
blindfolded and there's the I think that
their headquarters just started and the

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,029
forces capture the flag even for not
participating these are fun to watch and

5
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:26,759
if you if you have never participated
into a contest before it's a great way

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,070
to meet people and to get become part of
a community of your new so I i strongly

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,399
recommended

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,620
teams are often set up in advance but
they're frequently take new members or

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,760
they just want honestly other things are
remember that there's a party tonight

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,390
and it will be here and other than that
I'd like to introduce our speaker this

11
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,840
is Balint and he got into radios because
his grandfather was one of the Lancaster

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,899
bombers unit in world war two and had an
entire collection of of these radios

13
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,359
which was lucky enough to inherit and
apparently he inherited the gene to work

14
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,790
with them as well and he's going to tell
us about this latest advances so please

15
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,530
welcome speaker

16
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,060
thank you thank you thanks for coming
along

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:30,440
icelandic up along today I wanted to
give you an update on some interesting

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:37,479
things happening in the AM radio LSD I
will maybe give him a lot

19
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,780
give you a bit of inspiration signals
that you can explore or tools and

20
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,960
techniques that you can use to do your
own sort of inquiry because there are

21
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,820
just so many signals out there it's
impossible to cover them all but you

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:59,949
love it so to begin with this anybody
have any ideas what part of the spectrum

23
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:05,360
of looking at here we gotta hand in the
front row what do you think

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:22,000
900 megahertz I same band is correct

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,780
that's absolutely correct and it's an
incredibly crowded and busy part of the

26
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,600
spectrum just like 2.4 gigahertz this is
down 900 megahertz so you get much

27
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,480
better propagation but it's very busy
because some license so today we're

28
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,079
gonna look at the IRA spectrum various
parts of it but an update on aviation

29
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,680
and looking looking above to get signals
relate to that

30
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:00,959
doing sort of levels of violence using
drones with FDR and signals so I tried

31
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,040
to do some demos as we go through out of
the demagogues with a couple of things

32
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:13,760
here and the vast majority stuff and get
you can have a show of hands who's

33
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:25,859
actually used for testing and some sort
of software-defined radio RTL ok so

34
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:33,769
actually the 2.4 gigahertz I sent that I
like to show this one who can tell me

35
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:37,350
what sort of signals were actually seen
here you had to turn scholar someone

36
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:46,500
else I show you know wifi is one of them
was another one that's actually do when

37
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,100
I was out the egg the microwave
microwave in the kitchen when you turn

38
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,079
around actually change frequency
slightly you can see those coastlines

39
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,670
there that's actually the megatrends
side microbes if you're ever in two

40
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:09,548
point for somebody's operating a
microwave and I should also mention that

41
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,070
those peaks here the narrow ones can
anybody get what that is

42
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:19,849
bluetooth is out to the correct yes
there are many more channels but they're

43
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,920
all know

44
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:27,360
and the tool he had run-ins called for
it can be used with you radio and it's a

45
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,280
really slick way of looking at the radio
spectrum and accelerate this computation

46
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:40,619
using your GPU it's always nice to sort
of look at a pic of public radio

47
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,280
spectrum you're restricted too often
just the bandwidth of your device and

48
00:04:46,280 --> 00:05:04,130
then also the transport that it uses to
connect to the computer audio so for

49
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:12,520
example let's say you take the USR P B
210 thats usb3 it can do up to just over

50
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,250
fifty megahertz worth of instantaneous
bandwidth your computer then gives you

51
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,790
50 megahertz in this so much for the
spectrum to actually explode wouldn't it

52
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,540
be cool if you can actually visualize a
much larger portion of the spectrum

53
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,840
maybe not quite in real time as you
would expect with say just a single

54
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,869
channel but this here is actually a
continuous sort of plot from fifty

55
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,310
megahertz to 1.25 gigahertz in Kenya
radio and the way that works is that you

56
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:51,360
can use some trickery of of some
hardware and actually uses

57
00:05:51,360 --> 00:06:16,169
into 10 make next your computer by
Gigabit Ethernet

58
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:21,080
and what you can actually do then is
asking for some samples that it will

59
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,109
transfer over to you and then you tell
it to switch to another frequency and

60
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,710
you can tell it went to send the samples
and went to the center frequency so you

61
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:41,180
can do this in lockstep and you can do
it so quickly that will actually running

62
00:06:41,180 --> 00:07:01,400
I don't know how much will actually see
inside here because we know cross have

63
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:28,210
let me within the space of two minutes

64
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,650
so I can guarantee him a trip she gonna
see here because we're inside I ever got

65
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,729
something so if you have a look this is
actually the current spectrum from 50

66
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:43,840
megawatts 1.25 regards 50 megawatts in
the bottom left hand corner and then

67
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,150
then that entire range sort of cut up
into three so that you can see them

68
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,479
stacked upon one another so the bottom
left is fifty it goes right to the right

69
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,310
when you go through the middle and then
you end up to 1.25 on the right hand

70
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,740
side of the very top 10 on the various
lower left you'll be able to see you

71
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,370
look really closely the FM band and a
whole bunch of other stuff all the

72
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,780
reactive stuff there is probably the
cellular network all the different

73
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,369
channels that particular in the upper
portion of that band that you can see

74
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,889
the top and some other stuff leaking in
but it's really cool wages to get a

75
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:31,470
quick sense of a very wide portion of
your fuel spectrum

76
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:38,630
so we said that 9:15 was really busy we
can actually see that every player

77
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,599
little video this is actually running a
little bit slower than it would this is

78
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,860
being visualized teasing a program
called board line whose board line yet I

79
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,400
highly recommend that you check it out
if you like to analyze signals both in

80
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,250
real time or if you record them and then
analyzed them offline after the fact

81
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,030
it's a really powerful visualization
tool and really allows you to to drill

82
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,410
down and see what's going on so you can
see there's lots of different things

83
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,150
going on

84
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:09,280
lot of narrowband signals just a couple
of wideband ones and then it's it's

85
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,920
interesting to see things like the mesh
networking of smart meters you

86
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,410
interesting turn signals pop up but also
you and you know rather simple

87
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,280
modulation schemes that you could
potentially decoding and attempt to

88
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,270
figure out what it is we have a
directional antenna you can make my

89
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,860
ground trying to fuck something so this
is sort of assumed that now you can see

90
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,580
there's lots and lots burst all over the
place a very common scheme that's used

91
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,240
to communicate here is called frequency
hopping so one particular radio 1

92
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,690
actually always transmitted on the one
frequency the entire band might be

93
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,230
divided up into say fifty channels
alrighty channels or something like that

94
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:55,790
and then every radio will know when to
listen at the right time on any

95
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,130
particular frequency within this band
and then you'll see sort of signals

96
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,470
hopping around and I'll come back to
that and show you how can actually be

97
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:10,240
realized that to see what the same
channel occupancy is moving along I just

98
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,330
recently switched to keynotes I'll I'm
just going to add in a good shooters

99
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,490
transition for texts every Sullivan

100
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:29,310
so aviation has always been very close
to my heart and testing want to have any

101
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:40,359
more volume on this so that's actually
the pulses from that right on this is a

102
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,820
primary sponsor on radar in a port and I
talked about this before but just to

103
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,450
recap of your seat sending out pulses
and that will echo off metallic few

104
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,160
slices of airplanes for example in the
contract them so that it doesn't have to

105
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,810
have any active equipment on board was
just a little gonna ready to receive

106
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:06,819
that what you can do it you can process
that Daddy can take an STR and just hold

107
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,370
it up in me in your radar record it and
then you can process that so that it's

108
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,149
synchronizes to the initial post of the
right out which is down the very left

109
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:20,800
hand side then and then every single
time as opposed to record for a while

110
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,250
and that makes up one online so the
actual post that comes out on the left

111
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,610
but everything else often left hand side
is actually energy received from the air

112
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:36,410
from that post reflecting off nearby
environment now remember this is just I

113
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,910
was just using mister Yahoo the weekend
and nothing fancy no directional antenna

114
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:46,010
nothing like that huge directions and
it's actually wrote any on the radio but

115
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,230
you can actually see that there are
these shapes coming out and if you

116
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,260
unwrap them onto the map this is in the
Bay Area put that on the rate of his

117
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,980
name a few little space you can actually
see that the right point sexually lineup

118
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,970
with structures in the basic but the
bridges you got the power lines that

119
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,490
cross the bay which forms part of these
nice lines and all the stuff is really

120
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,500
close to News

121
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,040
so you can do interesting stuff of
privacy fence right aircraft modern

122
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,610
aircraft had lots of antennas on there
so there are lots of

123
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:27,480
interesting singles to try to look for
and that are simple 731 rate is lots of

124
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:37,180
different things and that makes you
really happy and then you know who said

125
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:45,279
I S and 80 S B flooding that kind of
stuff you can do cool stuff like receive

126
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:55,579
the broadcast from planes and playing
and then actually put them live on the

127
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:59,180
map as they come to land in San
Francisco and I'll change color when the

128
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,199
nose get touches the tarmac and so on

129
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,440
just if you like planespotting it's it's
an exciting stuff you've only seen seen

130
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,750
this one thing I did a while back was
actually implement the system through

131
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,170
Google get this virtual cockpit views if
you were sitting in the pilot's seat so

132
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,370
that's actually plane taking off from
SFO and you can imagine what the views

133
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:27,029
like and then we'll swing around to the
to the north and you can see the city

134
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:31,939
that I just recently moved up to the
city myself from the South Bay and I got

135
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:37,510
myself all my equipment again I'm gonna
try to put it back on line and release

136
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,079
it was open source position in seeing
the collecting dust and another

137
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,620
interesting part of that whole aviation
system is a sign from actually tracking

138
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,959
planes they will broadcast obviously
that position in altitude and other

139
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,768
information like that is a car's it's
the eight aircraft communication

140
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:59,459
reporting system and this operates in
the aviation VHF band and is a digital

141
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:04,839
essentially text messaging for planes
for you know the control systems or to

142
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,209
talk to ATC pilots to talk to Alan ops 2
rolls-royce engines to report

143
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:14,349
performance data back to rolls-royce I'm
the planet to delete this global VHF

144
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:19,970
network and that can be visualized to
use the system originally from Sydney

145
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,230
and I have it set up back there and
every time a balloon pops up that's

146
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,430
actually a cause message being sent or
received to a particular aircraft so

147
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:33,979
special shows you what's going on with
interesting because you have lots of

148
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:39,889
messages about the toilets being clubbed
this is my favorite so I added that

149
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:42,699
little easter egg

150
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:48,099
that's reported and then also get why
points for the long haul flights and you

151
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,970
can see these ones going to the west
coast of Australia and then those going

152
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:58,089
into Asia them and that's so good that
uses the Treasurer networking and people

153
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:03,360
looking at that and you know that's one
part of the aviation mechanic anybody's

154
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,069
guess as to what we're actually looking
at here right

155
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:15,680
more specifically what this particular
angle this particular perspective it's

156
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,160
an Inmarsat its bleeding into the topic
but this is actually being coverage so

157
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,649
this particular satellite in the defeat
or or the public information that shows

158
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:31,990
you the coverage area of there being
that satellite's far away in and they

159
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:40,300
can hit this entire part of the planet
with their coverage so indeed three and

160
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:46,250
is made up of a fleet actually and there
are they have a whole bunch in

161
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,779
geostationary orbit around the planet to
give you quite considerable coverage of

162
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:55,879
the planet with different sorts of
beings and services so I was talking

163
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:56,509
about

164
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:02,600
VHF but there's also the Inmarsat
iridium consolation and they also

165
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,569
provide services for aircraft so
traditionally whatever land you might

166
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:14,099
use VHF because you probably have better
data comes in and say hi bandwidth but

167
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,240
if you're out of the ocean for example
you have the option of using second cold

168
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,440
AHS HDL which is pretty cool that's much
lower but

169
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,970
in the spectrum but this is actually
nice because it's using satellites soyuz

170
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:33,130
the event and you can uplink and
downlink messages and phone calls and so

171
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:38,770
on and you must like many other birds up
there actually just bent pipe

172
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,490
transponders which means that they will
listen and broadcast on Flickr frequency

173
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:48,180
with a spot beam to one point on the
earth where they have for example in my

174
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:55,310
SATs ground stations and they will also
have very wide beings are different

175
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,650
frequency which had the uplink and
downlink or in this case the aircraft

176
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,750
and so you can see that have a system
sort of works there with the different

177
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:08,510
frequencies that operate what's nice is
that the downlink for the aircraft is

178
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:15,010
actually in the 1.5 to 1.6 e-hdi hurts
band which is easily received by

179
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,199
defined radios so what do you need just
need to put a dish up in your backyard

180
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,510
it's a little complicated that because
the signal so far away you need to

181
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,220
filter an amplifier best to prevent
other signals from getting in and also

182
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,900
to amplify that weak signal from the
satellite so you can make this homemade

183
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:41,660
left hand circular polarized helical
feed this is the handiwork of my good

184
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,210
friend in Buckley he just put this
together and it captures for me he's got

185
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,970
this corrects running into a band-pass
filter a low-noise amplifier and then

186
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,870
another on the back side and just woke
up to the STO so why is it nice and

187
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:01,370
interesting well in mice that allows you
to exchange messages from aircraft and

188
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,429
also set up calls and actually run the
call traffic as well

189
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,360
the Peter actually looking at system

190
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,229
sort of way to open doors to look at the
peak channel their different channels

191
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,400
but we want to talk with a p/e channel
that's where the coordination coming

192
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,330
begins uses TDM and carry signaling in
use at Tata you got the Argentine see

193
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:31,220
channels for reservation information and
then circuit switch mode or random data

194
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,530
from the aircraft so they're all all
used two different frequencies different

195
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,610
sort of schemes but fundamentally

196
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:43,870
you start with P channel so this is that
was the flow graph cleaning up a little

197
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,899
bit I don't know if you can tell the
difference

198
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,240
but this is sort of made up two
components one is the sort of basic

199
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,270
signal processing so if you haven't
already before this is an example who

200
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:02,270
can you ready to flow graph so the raw
signal come in in this case in the top

201
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,480
left which is essentially what you see
on the dish that will go through a whole

202
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,180
bunch of signal processing steps which
all explained in a moment and then it

203
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,500
will go through and plugs into some
other blocks in the bottom right hand

204
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:21,980
and coach actually do this sort of tacit
pausing and securitisation so the first

205
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,590
step is that yet this you can actually
see the spectrum and you get those

206
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:31,500
little spike sitting up in the air
actually all the peach channels that you

207
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,600
can see within this frequency range
there are actually a couple and then you

208
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,500
click on Mon and then you get the green
line and so that's cool channel

209
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,440
selection so you pick out the signal of
interest and then you shift your

210
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,870
basement spectrum to that particular
frequency and then you feel too so you

211
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,830
get this very narrow band signal that's
your channel that you want to decode the

212
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,560
next step is to determine the modulation
type so what you can do this thing

213
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:01,639
called blind steganalysis and I have
spoken about some tools and techniques

214
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,840
that you can use to sort of uncovered a
lands the idea is that if you don't if

215
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,740
you if the signal that you like and you
want to discover what's going on you

216
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,340
don't need to necessarily doing research
on online to begin with thought you have

217
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,179
to have a secret data sheets for it

218
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,420
specification actually just apply some
simple mathematical steps to usually

219
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,490
uncover what sort of modulation scheme
is cuz it's usually a subset of fairly

220
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:33,790
simple one so in this case it's GMs k
gassing them she came and what you can

221
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:39,480
do is you can take your signal square it
take to get 50 which is showing here and

222
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,120
then you should get to these peaks
equidistant from the sea and that's the

223
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:50,139
characteristic signature of MSK so we
know that

224
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,940
MSK the next step is you need to know
how quickly they are actually sending

225
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,200
the information down just called the
symbol rate and the symbol right on the

226
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,040
border right you can determine pretty
easily by taking the signal multiplying

227
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,860
it by Adelaide version of itself and
then you take the entity again and the

228
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:14,490
first big PQ have actually be the board
rights if you read that off

229
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:21,270
can anybody tell me what the board right
is what was the biggest peak frequencies

230
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:34,570
on the x-axis that's right 601 symbols
per second

231
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,250
here so the next step is once you know
what the modulation scheme is once you

232
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:42,050
know how quickly those symbols of coming
down you then wannabe been tracking them

233
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,710
and then turn them into bits that you
can operate on and then passing two

234
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,470
packets so this status quo clock
recovery is very important and there are

235
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,250
different sort of algorithms and data
rates just a block that you throw in and

236
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,600
Alexei try to track those symbols and
synchronized to it and then sample

237
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,379
that's exactly the right time so you get
a bit out and you can tell if it's

238
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,400
actually working properly because if you
put the samples this kinda looks good

239
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,590
writers Jim ska the way you can tell is
you'll have a whole bunch sort of what

240
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:20,620
extent a plus one and a whole bunch of
negative one and then you good it was

241
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:26,770
looking noisy than we probably be of
channels you might be too weak if you

242
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,970
start actually doing clock recovery on
that then it'll look much the same but

243
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,610
what you can do in this is one nice
thing about the visualization tools in

244
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:40,000
gonna radio you can switch then to dot
view and these samples because

245
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,940
essentially you're showing data points
in between your simple points you have

246
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,190
got all over that spectrum

247
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:53,960
that range bad choice of words between
negative one of one that once you click

248
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,210
recovery it's only going to peak you're
basically you're you're symbols that

249
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,780
would turn into bits and you see here
you actually have this nice blank space

250
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,649
in between negative 1+1 that means that
you've actually synchronize properly and

251
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,970
you'll sampling bits nicely within we
can do is you can slice through the zero

252
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:21,350
line here and then determine if this is
a one or two below one gonna be 2012

253
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:25,129
what you can do then is you can you use
a roster played these are incredibly

254
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,840
handy for determining if their structure
with and articles you want to see

255
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,090
structure so I just put those real ones
and zeros through into the rest of you

256
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:39,379
can see that there's this interesting
pattern that forms here you can play

257
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:45,840
around with the width of your plot and
determined that their 1200 wide frames

258
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,939
and this is synchronization signature
here you can see this it's the same

259
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,060
thing on each scan lines that's how your
decodable know when to begin decoding

260
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:01,310
the next frame so once you actually look
beyond that though it looks pretty

261
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,889
random so generally especially with
satellite links is always going to be a

262
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:09,420
combination of into leaving their
attraction and scrambling in there are

263
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,270
some very good reasons for that but
that's very extended it makes good sense

264
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:19,620
when you make in our think especially
space so here I actually had to go out

265
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,419
and such an intern the little bit
because once you get into for direction

266
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,310
and I mean you can try a whole bunch of
stuff but it just takes a lot of time so

267
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:34,139
you can cheat a little bit and figure
out what the specs are here and the idea

268
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,830
is that you had a signaling units to
come down this rambled become coated

269
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,199
then to leave and then

270
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,870
put into that payload after that
synchronization and remember house to

271
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,120
tell you that this is the coordination
for the rest of the channels when the

272
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,110
frame begins that's actually win the
frame start on all the other channels as

273
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:55,120
well so they for once you receive the
same crisis to this will be synchronized

274
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,209
to the rest of the channels to the
channels are going to be wider bandwidth

275
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:04,440
to support higher I write stuff like
voice to into leaving is really nice

276
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,190
because it protects against both areas
way into the works is that you have your

277
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:15,720
rule bitstream and then imagine the sort
of holding cells memory you write in

278
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:23,309
your bits from left to right and once it
fills up then you actually read it out

279
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:29,010
from top to bottom and you go across and
what that happens it it temporarily

280
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:34,389
disperses those bits over time so that
if you are in fact a burst error and

281
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:38,779
corruption bits you can use for Tara
correction to fix it up and I want to

282
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:42,960
thank the entire block it's really quite
quite meet the next step is doing

283
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,690
convolutional encoding that adds
redundancy to your bit stream so it adds

284
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,440
extra bits and then on the receiver side
you can use for example it's called the

285
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,809
Viterbi decoder but we'll figure out
that the maximum power 30 bits and if

286
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:59,840
your bits have some areas in it will
actually figure out which bits are

287
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,649
incorrect and then attempt to repair
them if the if they're not too bad

288
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:08,649
also very next game is used all over the
communications well what's nice is that

289
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:13,729
gonna radio has many of these books
already so it has a convolutional coding

290
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,830
blocking you can just throw that down

291
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:20,019
interestingly the code that uses is the
same cohen's has been the most popular

292
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:24,240
code used by the NASA Voyager probe they
use it all the way back then

293
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,470
it still survives to this day has been
superseded by March 11 codes like turbo

294
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:35,370
codes that are used in LTE nowadays but
this is still a very popular one and

295
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:40,178
then D scrambling to scrambling what it
does is it disperses the energy in your

296
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:46,440
signal so it uses up love you spectrum
is using additive scrambler and sort of

297
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,750
an example of how it works and then this
is a block to do that but you can just

298
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,840
push that through as well so once you do
that once you put it through all the

299
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,300
steps on the tobacco decide then you put
it back into the roster and you can see

300
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,178
there's a lot more structuring that
particular plot their compared to the

301
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:09,429
original one that we have also the CRC
check and then you can validate for

302
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:12,420
certain whether youre declaring problem
because then you should get the right

303
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:19,960
CIC so after all that then you can start
decoding messages and it took me a

304
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,340
little while to figure out cos CI CI's
can be a pain depending on which to use

305
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:31,220
it and usually comes at 20 but certain
CFCs come out to a fixed value here

306
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,780
0 be eight but what happens is you get
these packets coming out they'll start

307
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,070
with the first but it tells you what
sort of package it is the payload in a

308
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:44,290
CRC on the end zone to look the 71 and
then the way it works is that it signals

309
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:48,340
that the user data starting and accounts
down the packets

310
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:54,949
start with a C or indeed until it gets
down to zero and then prints out the the

311
00:27:54,950 --> 00:28:03,059
message so it ends when you get to seize
your so you get some interesting

312
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:07,809
messages now just to keep this in
context this is why I certainly love

313
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:12,230
this kind of stuff this is something on
the ground type message in computer it

314
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,650
was probably sent over the Internet to a
relay node on the ground station it was

315
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:22,670
turned into radio frequency energy it
was sent up 35 30,000 kilometers into

316
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:27,500
the sky onto a satellite it converted to
different frequency sent it back down to

317
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:27,950
work

318
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,529
this is a satellite that's just sitting
there with solar panels powerful battery

319
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:35,450
you know some long lifetime sent back
down to a plane that's hurtling through

320
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,970
the sky over the ocean I mean that's
pretty incredible this wasn't about

321
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:44,350
clogged toilets mind you but it was
telling people to hurry up cuz like

322
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:49,969
passengers may not be accepted for
travel when they when they do that this

323
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,970
is only for a short capture so I want to
take this back in right for a long

324
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:56,889
period of time and see what what sort of
juicy stuff you get you got notices here

325
00:28:56,889 --> 00:29:01,229
this airport I didn't know what it was
but basically all of it taxiways and

326
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:07,110
runways to be close which is really
helpful you get weather reports there

327
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:14,459
are different systems as well see PLC
idiocy he can decode that as well and

328
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,559
gain information about where particular
aircraft is heading and these are

329
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:23,129
aircraft that you wouldn't really have
any other contact from also what's

330
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,559
interesting about in my side is you put
it in the context of tragedies that have

331
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:34,620
occurred in in the recent history of
aviation you might remember image 370 if

332
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,549
you could listen on the other side of
the link to your own doctor processing

333
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:44,610
and and figure out do some of the credit
math they did to determine what portion

334
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:50,309
of the world the last in my set with rum
and then apparently these aircraft are

335
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:56,980
on time which is pleasant surprise and
then you have these weird human-readable

336
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:02,080
messages advise you have info no
participating TV I don't know what it is

337
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:08,710
but I've seen other ones where a plane
has been forced to rewrite and federal

338
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:14,220
police are gonna be waiting at the
airport so so that's in mice at work in

339
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:20,019
progress but again it's eliminating
interesting seagulls up there as well so

340
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:24,210
it runs deep in next next topic

341
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,860
this is actually the tip of you as I
Symbian which is used to send remote

342
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,560
control signals to drugs it's also very
very busy when you go to I can meet up

343
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:39,360
people flying make it a little article
on this a while back he's actually

344
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,020
played with a drone also seen a drone
flying people with FPV goggles so people

345
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,200
actually now put cameras on the drugs
and then they win these goggles so they

346
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,290
can see from the point of view of the
drawing then they actually writes I

347
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:55,020
don't know how they do it they are
machines it is incredible to watch them

348
00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:02,080
go in the reflexes that have caused runs
a tiny penis so fast but any ideas what

349
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:12,260
we're looking at here any ideas anyone
take a guess

350
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:22,680
correct what kind of video signal do you
think it is not quite enough unless he

351
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:31,290
was using kind of technology NTSC is
correct you said that very good that's

352
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,850
that's completely correct so we're
looking at a part of the spectrum and

353
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:39,230
what's weird is it is not just NTSE NTSE
over FM so you can actually see the

354
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:44,810
vertical sync the frame sync and then it
actually drawing the picture it so

355
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:50,560
that's actually how bout of systems
operating interference and if people go

356
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,310
on the wrong channel 10 interfere and
then I won't be able to see any more in

357
00:31:53,310 --> 00:32:01,889
the crash the boat to drugs at least so
drunk have fun they sound depending on

358
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:09,270
the model you get it can sound like
really big loud mosquitoes and I just a

359
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:19,330
little bit of a test I put a webcam on
there they're hooked up to a year each

360
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:24,990
310 which is an embedded you SRP going
here went to have a look and actually

361
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:30,950
has suffered defined radio plus an armed
forces are inside plus a whole bunch of

362
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,680
other goodies so you can look it up with
different peripherals and in this case

363
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,740
because it's more compact you can put on
the underside of a drone and then do

364
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,960
anything you want

365
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,560
up in the end and as I'm sure you will
know the higher altitude you get the

366
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,810
most signals you seen often the stronger
they are so instead of going to the top

367
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:57,270
of a building can senator nothing so
here this is gonna radio program the

368
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:01,620
webcams sending images to another
program that sends it down

369
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:06,570
of RAF and then this is the screen
recording on my laptop can see some

370
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:11,980
crazy guy jumping up and down there my
friends actually flying the drone

371
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:18,140
little bit of fun I wouldn't recommend
that for FPV importance re-balancing

372
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:23,920
that system and it's not terribly robust
but just a bit of fun Proofpoint what's

373
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,930
nice there in kind of scary is that you
can fly and run what you shouldn't but

374
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:36,520
anywhere has anybody seen that the I
think the FAA put out an exposed to give

375
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,540
you advisories on on if you know you
shouldn't be flying in a particular area

376
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:46,100
that it determines using geolocation
friend's fiance sure that to me and

377
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:53,199
apparently everywhere that she turns it
on a conf line

378
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,169
but here you can send them up to quite a
while and you can see into everyone's

379
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:04,559
backyard it's it's quite incredible so
imagine that for RAF so here again

380
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:11,159
taking off and this is from the point of
view of the drawing is being recorded on

381
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,859
my laptop so sending the information
down this is it was a different systems

382
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:22,690
are sometimes the the extreme gets
corrupt a little bit but again very very

383
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:30,099
quickly go quite high up and just see
the landscape as it unfolds kind of one

384
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:33,399
thing you know there is one of spectrum
scanners have just want to look at the

385
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,020
activity in the spectrum not do anything
in particular just do the Recon you can

386
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,139
run on there

387
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,700
and as an example this was the sort of
spectrum that was output on the ground

388
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:50,549
and then I'll shoot those signals were
twenty 20 GB higher so that was pretty

389
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:54,029
nice and you can just have this run will
collect and then come back down down the

390
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:57,910
results have a look and then pick
anything that you want to investigate

391
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,558
further

392
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:04,569
that's just the general STR approach you
can also combine that with other really

393
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:10,319
need technologies and their USB ports on
this thing you can plug in an iterative

394
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:17,410
dongle or you can plug in a and Atmel IC
Ravens Ed dongle which i happen to have

395
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:30,288
plugged in here and I mean that will
actually be cozy between for example

396
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:36,760
using your radio is everything up bro
nice project GRI Tripoli at 11:54 that

397
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,260
will do and you can run there as well
but if you wanna do other things on

398
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,289
there then you can just like a dongle in
two in the traditional hardware approach

399
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:53,230
so has a plugin for kismet so is flying
around a little bit and pick up some

400
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,519
Bluetooth packets and this is something
that I've been working on a little bit

401
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:02,359
if any of you familiar with kismat is
actually if all the correct me if I'm

402
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:06,759
wrong because they didn't vote on this
but there's an incomplete ZigBee plugin

403
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:12,630
and I sort of took a look at it and had
quite a lot of nice work done to it and

404
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:18,000
it would work with this is a raven
mongol bit it wasn't finished so I

405
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,920
finish it and I set up a little bit
because I want to get the nice Google

406
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:29,509
the signals and so on so it kinda treats
it like wi-fi networks to make that

407
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:38,000
happen but this is actually now picking
up networks and its kinda nice the other

408
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,720
other thing and hope they're condemning
that to you in a minute I'll come back

409
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,868
to that so essentially now you

410
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:48,759
you have a stable platform and if there
are other in a modern embedded computers

411
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:52,930
as well if you want to try something
else but this is seems to be good all in

412
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,259
one package for example and you can do
all of these things with your drawing

413
00:36:56,259 --> 00:37:01,410
and fly them around and hopefully get
into trouble of the batteries run out I

414
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:06,450
had run fly away once and how to
firmware bug and I just kept line and

415
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,879
then it ran out of battery because this
was a night in this big blinking thing

416
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:17,289
in the sky and then it just fell out of
the sky so last night at I think 140 I

417
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:23,700
decided to order a lift and drive around
Dec with the with the kids met with

418
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,069
anything just a test that out and show
some interesting today the pool its

419
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:29,970
driver had no idea what's going on

420
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:36,160
very confused because I didn't go
anywhere in the dryer and come back so

421
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:43,859
he was running they're actually had been
hit on the passage of all these weird

422
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:48,130
lights and wires all over his car and I
i put the GPS antenna magnet on the roof

423
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:52,710
he said what what you put out there
you're recording mode which is another

424
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:59,140
really nice dongle the Raven 800 many
just hanging out the window you know

425
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:06,650
just catching the brace and and so this
is the result I think I ended up picking

426
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:14,930
up a 52 54 57 ZigBee networks around and
if you consider everyone has WiFi

427
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:19,049
Bluetooth ZigBee is one of those
interesting protocols and is taking off

428
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:23,450
a little bit you know the IOT and what
have you and I was expecting there to be

429
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:27,279
so much traffic around but there are a
lot of technologies that use it nowadays

430
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:32,130
and again really been looking there and
interesting now people are taking notice

431
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:36,200
and analyzing it in terms of security so
you know all the green dots along that

432
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,489
ring part of the network's run this
place I saw some clear text something

433
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:44,180
was reporting the time you could inject
packets and maybe it might be nice big

434
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,118
sign somewhere you can change the time
on there and then there's this plane

435
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,999
takes coming through there is a

436
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:55,859
what was that last night but it's nice
to see you at Acton obviously go back

437
00:38:55,859 --> 00:39:03,308
this is the awesome driver he was a
really good sport especially that late

438
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:10,199
and it was also nice about the setup is
310 you power up the battery plugged

439
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:14,699
into a USB battery pack so it's really
portable just threw it in my bag they're

440
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:19,589
doing its thing I thought I will I'm
gonna catch a plane left it running for

441
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:26,279
on wifi wifi don't like being done it so
far that's at Phoenix I guess the plane

442
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:27,779
was landing or taking off

443
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:34,419
picking up in that has wifi networks and
then if you dare nowadays with

444
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:38,439
everything that's been going on you know
put any sort of intent up to your window

445
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:42,739
in a window seat and in this case get a
GPS fix you can see that its findings

446
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:51,059
but again it's portable and compact like
that he can work on a project in flight

447
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:52,359
just

448
00:39:52,359 --> 00:40:02,710
just be aware that they will probably do
an extra checking a bag you know

449
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:07,450
interestingly the far more strict about
this in Europe than in america which is

450
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:15,239
surprising considering everything I got
pulled over like you wouldn't believe so

451
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:18,950
just briefly then finish up some other
interesting signals z-wave who saw the

452
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:24,129
z-wave talked yesterday it was it was
really impressive great tool home

453
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,549
automation what's interesting is a
dearth rewrites the Seaway views and

454
00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:34,359
again i just want to see what was out
there so I put together this flow graph

455
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:38,788
that simultaneously dumont elizalde 3
rights and then just up the road packets

456
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:46,489
at the bottom and interestingly that
sort of Miss so i thought well if they

457
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:51,200
doing stuff to do tomorrow I'll take my
kids if I can pick anything up and in

458
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:58,038
fact I was jumping up other friends
yesterday and I actually had a running

459
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,339
at the beach under many of their last
night in the car and what's interesting

460
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:06,239
is quite short range but neither may go
to get a bit of extra distance actually

461
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,960
picked up a whole bunches you a driving
around to know geo-tagging a special

462
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,599
tagging but again it's just interesting
to see that you can get that just by

463
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:21,960
driving around laura is another one who
heard of Laura lawrence continued on the

464
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,009
scene it's part of his hold on power
wide area networking phenomenon that's

465
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:31,950
happening in the IOT because to Gigi SMG
Paris is going to be some sit and

466
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,879
retired he needs to replace its own
lawyers one of the options

467
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,930
interestingly its troops spread spectrum
which is quite a different sort of

468
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:42,970
signal and if you look on the left hand
side as you can see I see that ship down

469
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:48,169
lines that's actually the signal and
think Oh during that so this is a little

470
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:52,460
off that generates and down convinces
church so that you can see what the

471
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,980
underlying legislation and had a
daughter is encoded there so if you

472
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:01,200
imagine on the left hand side of these
ones you see the actual church on the

473
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,980
the rule spectrum and on the right hand
side you have the down converted church

474
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,230
so we basically church because this
frequency that increases over time and

475
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,230
it goes back then laura is sort of does
the church goes the opposite direction

476
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,700
so it's going right direction again but
jumps around in

477
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:23,120
offset so if you make your own signal
basically just a sort of going into a

478
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,980
voltage-controlled oscillator and then
multiply the two signals you can

479
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:32,620
straighten those dandelions and that's
what's happening on the left and they

480
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,370
claim to have a good coexistence because
the band is so busy and all these other

481
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:39,870
signals so with this you can still get
your lower rates to go through when you

482
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:45,600
don't commit the church you see how that
characteristic line of energy that's

483
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:50,759
actually the lower signal and then at
this point it becomes an FSK

484
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,570
multi-ethnic skate issue of decoding
it's just have these spikes in energy

485
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,770
that appear all over the place and
depending what being a teenager in that

486
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:05,220
is your data so it's kind of need and
what's really cool his in this one is

487
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,930
actually a BPSK signal going right
through the middle of the church and you

488
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:12,259
think we'll have two singles are
deferring if that's what it looks like

489
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:17,330
there if you don't convert the church
that BPSK disappears in your look with

490
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:23,390
those little bit of energy and I was
really confused as I saw these other

491
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:26,910
trips and I just thought it was a lawyer
but there are different sorts of chips

492
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,359
singles out there and it's not Laura I
don't know what it is if anybody has any

493
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,510
ideas on wall is but it's kind of cool
mountain again if you'd unconverted

494
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:39,060
turns out to be the same sort of
scenario so just another interesting

495
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:46,240
sort of mutant seen me to keep an eye
out like this a new mission it was being

496
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:53,560
set up in San Francisco and on the east
coast various places just to finish up

497
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,259
then I wanted to show you how you can
sort of going for a long drive some way

498
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,770
you can get a broad overview of the
spectrum and one in one picture of the

499
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:02,810
quickly so is driving down from

500
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:08,529
petaluma back to San Francisco these
attract and retain running they're

501
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:12,620
constantly collecting the 915 megahertz
band would record about half a second

502
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:16,950
dump it and just keep cycling on that so
if you would please any one of those

503
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:21,500
individual recordings of half a second
UNC the sort of frequency hopping stuff

504
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,770
that we saw before or interestingly this
one

505
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:31,020
anyone's guess as to what this was this
is just after I finished crossing the

506
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:37,320
Golden Gate Bridge going so I know you
know the answer to anyone else

507
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:42,490
yeah that's right in this case is fast
track this is the fast-track readers I

508
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:47,839
was going through the toll booth and
what you can do there is you can take

509
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:54,690
each individual recording individual
recording you basically doing a fifty of

510
00:44:54,690 --> 00:45:00,830
the entire things like a step 2 50 and
then you take the maximum valuable the

511
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:04,299
bench for that entire recording and they
give you sort of the energy signature of

512
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:09,740
what happened during that time you take
one of those and then you make that a

513
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:15,490
scanline horizontal scan line and in
each recording every subsequent

514
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:19,740
recording that will give you all of the
subsequent scan lines so what you're

515
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:25,370
seeing here is like the heat map over
time of the 915 megahertz spectrum and

516
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:28,680
it's actually really begin with so many
down simply you can't quite make out the

517
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:35,680
detail but it's interesting to see here
on the left hand side there you got this

518
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,520
frequency hopping channelized whatever
it is maybe smart meters but attorneys

519
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,240
in left hand side the band he got a
different sort of frequency hopping

520
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,970
wider band channels there some summer in
San Francisco again you can GPS take

521
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:52,980
over as well and he had this is actually
the fast track I sort of saw this and

522
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,510
thought oh what's that going to have a
look at the recording and then I saw and

523
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:01,980
then if your local oscillator you get
drunk on the night and then you get

524
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:07,830
these really terrible signals he cites
diagonal shouldn't be dying almost put

525
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:14,569
on hold oscillator warming up that's no
good and then if any of you have used up

526
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:19,030
to 25 its use by Public Safety added
this new feature where you can enter the

527
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:22,930
encryption key into the decoder and then
we'll pick the right one for the network

528
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:30,180
you're using Unity cryptanalysis you can
look at that time spectrum SEO meetup

529
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,870
San Francisco monthly check them out

530
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:48,040
good fun people do cool stuff like shock
collars for dogs with STR and they had

531
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,759
to thank you very much
