1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,010
announcements don't forget that there
are a whole bunch of events down the

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:11,760
hallway go visit you had for Chris
hackers or charity the season on labs go

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,620
see other things besides just the talks
that this is going to be an awesome one

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,770
since we're running behind I'm not going
to give away any shrug

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:32,980
but go ahead and give a warm welcome to
Sean Cassity ok so when I try to go to

6
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,529
this quick because we 10 minutes left
and i wanna leave time for questions

7
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:47,790
Sean on the CCO presidio we are pleased
that are good alright so I'm Sean on the

8
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,550
CTO presidio cyber security management
company for banks but today I'm talking

9
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,449
about fishing so when we think of
fishing a lot of people think of

10
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:59,159
something like this like you know crappy
emails or something that really dumb

11
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,970
stupid users like to click through and
they I guess wanna buy watches from

12
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,929
email or something and you know every
you know I T people have always been

13
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,340
kind of annoyed about it like why do you
find you click on these things but

14
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:23,910
really fishing is actually a incredibly
dangerous part of security it is the

15
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:31,080
primary source for attacks from the groc
and my favorite part of this quote is

16
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,940
really that exploits aren't needed
they're not used and they're not

17
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,929
relevant or days are just too valuable
to burn so instead you can just fish and

18
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:47,540
get a better result with much much less
effort so when we think about it is

19
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,380
almost as she is ready hits you in the
face with this is no big deal

20
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,490
every I D person knows exactly what
happened all is a phishing attack if you

21
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,360
do anything you wouldn't happen to you I
could just watch this for four ever

22
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,470
but this is really what I want our
attack we're going to develop to be this

23
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,910
is Blade Runner and so in Blade Runner
there are republicans and there are

24
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,690
humans are trying to find who the
republicans are in there is really

25
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,340
intense test they have to go through to
find who the rebel against and who are

26
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,550
the people and that's what I want are
said to be allowed to be so good they

27
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,560
want to be tough for anyone to actually
figure out its ash what would the ideal

28
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,640
phishing attack be trained users are
susceptible so everybody always says oh

29
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,649
we should train people to combat them
but even better phishing attack is even

30
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,950
if you knew the attack could happen it
could still happen you the attacks give

31
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:48,829
access to machines credentials are good
sensitive data it's be hard to detect

32
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,760
either during or after the fact to rely
on a difficult to fix flaws because you

33
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,870
know if you can imagine oh david's no
good after the patch so ideally this

34
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,330
fish would be kind of persistent and be
widely applicable so that it affects a

35
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,930
lot of users are these lot of your
target users so let's just talk about

36
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,700
kind of general anti phishing techniques
before we get into LastPass so this is

37
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,880
my conclusion slide presentation but
really didn't want to take away from my

38
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,769
my talk this fishing is a software
vulnerability and it's really not the

39
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:28,840
fault of dumb users it's the fault of
the software that is the reason why

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,860
their trick users don't want to be
fished they would prefer not to be and

41
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,680
in we need to make our software fishing
resistant and as a few ways we can do

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,970
that but the main rule is if it's easy
for an attacker toothache or confused

43
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,000
user the software itself has broken the
software should be fixed like email is

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,730
kind of like a lost cause at this point
right like it so hard to fix but if we

45
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,260
were redesigning an email replacement
today we would make sure it hard for

46
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,140
attackers take if users are tricked

47
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,660
designer and really overall good you x's
a security measure if you've ever done

48
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,359
any user experience design you know that
any time a user you

49
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,520
is your application incorrectly is not
the user's fault it's your fault your

50
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,570
application should have been better
better designed as a corollary software

51
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,940
must be easy to use correctly ok so some
traditional fishing techniques training

52
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,430
every training training training going
to see I don't think that's enough

53
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,930
trusted source verification this stuff
like HBS Extended Validation type stuff

54
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,270
this is really Bank of America this
isn't some Bank of America with AK or

55
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,150
something

56
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:45,150
all the email protections as PDF just
trusted source for vacations binary

57
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,219
signatures is going to talk about
gatekeeper here at the binary signature

58
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,610
type protection for OSX security images
very large into a bank in like a choose

59
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,770
choose the image so you know you know
this is really us it's just a trusted

60
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,390
source verification type deal

61
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:06,950
suspicious data warnings is just another
simple things like oh hey this e-mail

62
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,580
look suspicious and just an even more
advances like phishing detection let's

63
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,200
go into example every knows Microsoft
Word and has a few anti-phishing

64
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,669
measures in it so whenever you download
something from the internet and open up

65
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:26,049
the word you see this protected you and
it happens no matter what the document

66
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,030
contains it's just like hey watch it
this document might be unsafe it doesn't

67
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,140
tell you why it's unsafe it's just
saying okay just watch out in this kind

68
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,750
of nondescript way to click Enable
editing actually enable the document

69
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,740
this is a totally fine wine and his
malicious document there's really no

70
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,350
difference and the user can tell and if
you could enable editing on this you get

71
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:55,250
this security warning macros have been
disabled so probably everyone here knows

72
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,250
where you can have militias macros and
if you click Enable content your

73
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:05,350
computer beyond but it looks really
similar to the protected you think you

74
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:11,689
might say any content Netflix I love
content just click content

75
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:17,349
what do you say hey users don't don't
don't click Enable content always right

76
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:21,729
so then if you're a professional pen
tester you might do something like this

77
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:27,089
hey could enable content to actually
view this so if you actually wanna be a

78
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,569
pen tester is actually really easy way
to do it

79
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:33,939
people really use this and it's really
gets companies hacked it is really

80
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:39,699
really effective and you might not think
about it so I can better name for naval

81
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:44,459
context and content horrible run malware
would be really good I think people

82
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,929
would understand what that meant one
script a locker but really my favorite

83
00:06:48,929 --> 00:07:00,188
is just yellow who cares whatever so
here's here's the OS X version OS X

84
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:04,829
version is actually completely different
and it actually is sort of useful

85
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:08,209
actually tells you macros are these
harmful things and you might want to not

86
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:12,979
trust him and default is disabled macros
this seems pretty pretty reasonable as

87
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:17,159
opposed to enable content where you just
yellowing all over the place so just

88
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:20,989
summarize problems that microsoft word
got no easy messages warnings are

89
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:23,649
unclear what's a macro it doesn't even
explain it

90
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:27,889
enable content good thing this
cross-platform inconsistency but overall

91
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:32,539
the consequence of what the user is
going to do is unclear is unclear when

92
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:37,188
you click Enable content your computer
will be owned ok so overall

93
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:41,289
anti-phishing design is about which
pixels of the stream can be controlled

94
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:44,579
by the attackers the attacker control
all the pixels it doesn't matter right

95
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:50,709
so anti-phishing is either reducing what
controlling and often these really

96
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:58,789
aren't safe warning them that overall
you need to help the user make the right

97
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:04,110
decision you can't just say you know the
user has to know what a macro is that

98
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,289
they have to be a program they have to
be an idea

99
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:13,089
ok let's talk about our target so we're
going to target last passed last passes

100
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:19,569
a browser extension it is a password
manager and it holds passwords credit

101
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:23,479
card secure documents whatever you wanna
put in it it's very widely used for me

102
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:24,310
the most

103
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:30,050
popular password manager has an API
which can be very important later it's

104
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,409
very easy to detect if someone's using
LastPass and its if anyone ever use it

105
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,140
it's kind of buggy just slightly buggy
around the edges and it can be very

106
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,569
useful for us there's any inconsistency
in our phishing attack that's gonna play

107
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,880
into our favor cuz it's a go to last
past has bugs you know whatever tell me

108
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,260
just go through how last past works if
you're unfamiliar with it so it has a

109
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,900
vault and in the vault all your secrets
are encrypted on your side and the

110
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:03,780
uploads LastPass encrypted so they don't
have access to it so you put in URLs of

111
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,640
websites can log into names user names
passwords all that stuff you'd expect it

112
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,600
can generate passwords for you so you
don't have to pick passwords on your own

113
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,170
useful use password and it saves it for
you so you can save your you know your

114
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,449
website then when you get a login it
puts the last risk in the corner and

115
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,730
like hey you have one pass from these
websites you click that asterisk and

116
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,500
fills in your passwords you only have
you know you don't have to remember your

117
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,130
password is very easy but this is the
thing that caught my eye was using last

118
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:42,370
past few months ago and it said my last
past session expired please login and I

119
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,450
had just been sent a link to click hole
which is a great website of British

120
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:55,020
visit and it it was a website and trust
and this message shows up in my browser

121
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,410
like actually click whole drawn this I
don't know if they didn't and you know I

122
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,969
looked into it in turns out they didn't
but that that's when I that's when I got

123
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:10,880
my first idea then when you click try
again to log in to log in page you can

124
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,640
see the sexy in your browser Chrome
extension URL and then when you click

125
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,790
Login to communicate with LastPass
servers so I developed a plan for

126
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:27,140
attacking LastPass ok just step one lets
redirect the user to a benign looking

127
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,319
but malicious site or a completely
benign site at CNN dot com but has a

128
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,740
cross-site scripting vulnerable

129
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,790
now this is important for fishing
because most users have been trained you

130
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,390
get an email that brings you to Bank of
America don't click it right

131
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,560
instead go to Bank of America but
instead if I send you a funny image of

132
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,779
like a cat hey David check out this
funny image you have no problem there's

133
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:53,540
no danger and clicking that link so I'm
gonna bring you to a website that looks

134
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,310
completely normal nine then if you have
last best install I'm going to put the

135
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,569
banner of top and say hey your last pass
is you know session has expired please

136
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,860
login that's my manner not last past
look exactly the same then when they

137
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:16,680
click our banner alshaune fake login
page that I control and then if they

138
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,029
need if their account has to factor
enabled then we will prompt them for

139
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:29,060
their two-factor code and then I'll
download all their secrets ok so now we

140
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,250
have to do it so step one gathering HTML
so I know if you've ever he knows about

141
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,610
this but there's an elite hacker
technique be called right-click inspect

142
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,640
element

143
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,490
I'm a little nervous tell anybody about
it but it is awesome so this this is the

144
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,640
real last text message and I literally
just right-click inspect element here is

145
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,439
the HTML for turns out tonight frame and
so what I did was I just copied into my

146
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,310
own file and there's a few CSS files I
just copy the copy them to hear is like

147
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,520
this css you can actually just type in
the exact thing you can right click

148
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:08,680
download the CSS very simple very easy
isn't hard and so I I got the

149
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,530
notification HTML the login page
slightly related hacker technique I

150
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:18,990
think this was in fact right click view
page source very easy open it up

151
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,060
copy paste are you can save the page it
doesn't matter all the HTML the images

152
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:30,239
inline images it's really really easy
and then we can do our own this is

153
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,750
Firefox Chrome Firefox and Firefox pops
up this on Windows a possible windows 8

154
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,730
window a little harder because you can't
obviously right click on a Windows

155
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,390
window and get those get the source but
it's still in the viewport and because

156
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,590
it's still in the viewport week we can
do something with this this this is

157
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:56,450
something we can do what to do a little
more work later but we can do it

158
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:02,980
ok now we need to show the banner show a
notification ok first we need to detect

159
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,900
if LastPass installed I started working
on it used to be super easy

160
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:12,840
JavaScript jobs with variable called
navigators up plugins and you gave it

161
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,250
last Passover tell you last pass install
this they very wisely moved away from

162
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:23,020
this because you shouldn't just
broadcast all the plugins they use so we

163
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,900
need to do something else so I was
looking at last pass and I saw the

164
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:32,430
asterisk on a page and how does that
answer is to right-click inspect element

165
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,420
nice song that has a background image of
you know actually that asterisk as a

166
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:45,400
background image what if I could detect
the same thing so I'll put a form online

167
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,140
page that looks like it's just username
password field and I'll see if LastPass

168
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,990
actually detect

169
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:57,779
it so here the function is LastPass
installed so I'll put you know I'll get

170
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,000
my username feel very easy very
straightforward this works after maybe

171
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,680
three hundred milliseconds LastPass
wants the page to settle before it draws

172
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,599
all of the asterisks but does it is a
detective last best installed very

173
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,260
straightforward and you can actually
said the visibility of reform to hidden

174
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,730
and it will still draw it so I don't
have to show the forums the user even

175
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,920
though I didn't have to even appear to
user LastPass runs in his last pass

176
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,839
installed get the browser if it's if
it's chrome inserts into the chrome HTML

177
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,620
otherwise with Firefox and certification
of Firefox their different differently

178
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,839
just because they don't really have
cross browser compatibility so you have

179
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,440
to do each individually and that's it no
matter the easy and here's here's my

180
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,250
banner I decided to use a different text
your account has been temporarily

181
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,390
suspended I thought that was really good
called action suspended better recovery

182
00:14:53,390 --> 00:15:01,670
everything like that message and it
looks exactly the same as last past ok

183
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,610
but there's a major problem ever use
LastPass you know they put a big

184
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:12,190
LastPass button on your bar and its red
when you're logged in and yellow or gray

185
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,430
if you're not logged in so my whole
attack kind of fell apart could

186
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,790
literally just look at that icon and
then tell if there were a lot actually

187
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:28,980
logged out or not but so I was on last
passes buck rampage by the way but crowd

188
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,060
and countless are really good place to
find vulnerabilities I'm not talking

189
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,529
about like oh you'll go there and then
search of exclusions list is a really

190
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:42,550
interesting place to find a really low
severity vulnerabilities because

191
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,149
everything that they exclude is
something that people report and if they

192
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:50,220
excluded they don't want to know about
it because it's probably not fixed so I

193
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,430
was looking on their out of scope and
they have a lockout cross-site request

194
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,250
forgery exclusion and like what the only
reason they have this on their exclusion

195
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,670
list so a lock-out process requests for
your by the way is away you can log

196
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,829
people out

197
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,860
out of a website or something without
having access you on your website did

198
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,290
you want to log out / Todd you put this
link and you're automatically logged out

199
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:16,280
of Slashdot so it lasts passes the same
thing so if I put on my website this

200
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,020
you're logged out of last pass it's all
you have to do it to get requiring the

201
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,170
time I think they're gonna see a grey or
yellow icon instead of a red ones who

202
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:30,410
actually you have been logged out this
is real nothing is wrong everything

203
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,400
looks good

204
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:39,579
ok and stuff and we're gonna have to
displace HTML the issue miles apart but

205
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:44,120
here's the problem the protocol so
chrome and has this chrome extension I i

206
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,950
cant spoof this you know this probably
you know somebody can maybe find a bug

207
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:53,620
in this but I couldn't and so I need a
way to work around but this is really

208
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,200
huge random looking string that's going
to help us out

209
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,130
users are going to be paying super close
attention and my favorite part though is

210
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,720
it looks like an unencrypted connection
if they had put a locker some kind of

211
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,010
info bubble they're saying that this is
an extension it would be totally done so

212
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,589
when I did I just bought Chrome
extension duppy W pretty close

213
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:20,428
domain W for passwords right password
manager I figured it was pretty good as

214
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:22,809
$3

215
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:30,120
so the you are up most the URL hides it
hides it it still has the same icon and

216
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,139
i actually surveyed a few people at my
job and I was like look this efficient

217
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:38,620
tax pot the phishing attack and my
co-workers said how did you sleep the

218
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,268
Chrome extension I even looked at that
and like he he he was looking for any

219
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:48,129
couldn't find it and this is an expert
computer user so this is just a really

220
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:53,299
nifty low-cost solution ok so there's
another problem I wonder if anyone can

221
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:59,379
see it's this is my page is a pretty
major problem with this so last past has

222
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:05,730
drawn an asterisk on the email field it
detected a forum so so we're gonna

223
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,840
right-click inspect element and what the
first one is just insert sad if and that

224
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,269
literally absolutely positions at pixel
by pixel the exact place needs to be

225
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:19,789
that's it that's all it does and we just
need to remove that so he's removed the

226
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:24,908
day of so it ended at runtime and it's
just in the dogs we can we can remove it

227
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:29,600
so the big question is how do you detect
when the dollar is changed to this

228
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,498
element in this type of my function and
then see what I can do as I can actually

229
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:40,559
add it to the body and then in my
function I will remove the death so

230
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,440
let's just look at it

231
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,769
here's my mutation observer it's going
to have a function called list of

232
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:51,179
mutations that happened so for every
mutation call this function if it added

233
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:56,159
notes then let's go through every single
note that it added

234
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,440
and let's get that node and if the node
starts with underscore underscore LPD

235
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,049
actually my co-counsel better against
the defendants lied just remove it and

236
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:11,480
that's it and listen on document doc
body for child elements that's all this

237
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,220
is now whenever last past tries to add
the asterisk we will remove it

238
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:22,490
unfortunately the master password
actually uses a different technique it

239
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:29,049
goes back to the drawing background
image method so we're gonna use another

240
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:32,620
mutation observer however this time
we're going to

241
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,699
to listen on attributes and we're going
to reset the style whenever the style

242
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,050
has changed the background image however
there's a major problem with this code

243
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,540
the major problem with this code on
offense but it's already seen the major

244
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,379
problem this code is it caused an
infinite loop I'm saying hey whenever

245
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:54,140
this style changes change the style and
the net style change the style not sell

246
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,950
it is and forever so actually it is
actually hard locks Firefox it locks it

247
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,870
up really really good

248
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,739
nobody cares about browser tosses
anymore but I gave him a treat size

249
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:10,030
version the DAS you want it it's fine it
doesn't just lock up the tab instantly

250
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:15,840
it's kind of fun you know punk your
friends with it so here it is here is

251
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,399
our login page no asterisks looks really
good

252
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,630
exactly the same except for the dot T W
ok

253
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:28,800
the next step we have to also get the
two-factor authentication thing it's

254
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,669
going to be really straightforward
here's my version is no difference

255
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:40,040
something back and forth there's no
difference just just the DPW domain ok

256
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:47,230
to the Firefox login screen this is a
little harder it uses a Windows pop-up

257
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:52,970
window and OSX it kind of slides out
from the top Satoshi cross platform

258
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:58,040
dependent on Linux it's kind of all over
the place but it's similar to Windows

259
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:05,220
sorting to do is we have to do some hard
work and actually figure out how to draw

260
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:12,110
that thing on you know on each platform
but luckily HTML and CSS really good so

261
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:19,120
we need to assess for dummies it makes
fishing easier it turns out on CSS are

262
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,500
super powerful at the worst case you
could put a Kansas up and draw every

263
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,140
single pixel exactly the way you wanted
but I need to do that was very easy to

264
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,679
just brought so here it is

265
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:36,050
here's my version and last passes
version which ones which there are some

266
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:41,620
differences I kind of ran out of time
but they're very very close by I ask

267
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,939
people my job they couldn't figure it
out if you can figure it out

268
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:54,120
you have sharp eyes left somebody said
the left is the real one now that left

269
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:03,479
us think 12 rice-a-roni ok I won't tell
you anyway there's a few differences if

270
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,030
I spent a little more time distance took
me like just a few hours to cook up if I

271
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:18,190
spend a few more hours I could make it
exactly the same question was is there a

272
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:23,410
little shading on the right yeah there's
a minor shading differences also my my

273
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:29,950
bottom arrow isn't isn't quite the same
there's a text with differences but it

274
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:35,620
it's pretty close here it is on OSX
again there's some slight differences

275
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,439
but it's pretty close and I think if you
were actually using it you wouldn't be

276
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,920
able to tell I'm not going to be too
obvious one and you will have to fuel

277
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,780
have to then figure out from that minor
shadow difference or something that this

278
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,830
isn't the real one that's not a good
security policy would never actually say

279
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:01,659
like users just look for measured the
box shadow with like that and then

280
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:07,590
you'll know which is real and when she's
fake so I'm also interested like you

281
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:12,510
know if if if you could just drive home
page you can try anything so you know

282
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,610
sometimes OSX pops up messages that are
just like this is trying to unlock for

283
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:21,030
the software is installing and I can
draw those same messages I'm actually

284
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:25,710
really curious what people can do just
like drawing the exact same message just

285
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,470
on pages because if your browser
viewport is ninety percent 90% your time

286
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,510
like that's just a huge attack that
Turkish people can draw anything they

287
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,990
want on it

288
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:46,990
ok therefore we are going to actually
make this a real attack and steal data

289
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,590
so what will happen once the user login
it's going to send the credentials to

290
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:56,510
our attacking server our service gonna
call last best mobile API only because

291
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:01,770
that was the easy Python library I found
two factors required to report that back

292
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,320
to the user and/or any redirect to the
two factors green otherwise we're gonna

293
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,820
have to plaintext secrets report success
I'll take a millisecond take very long

294
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,178
time and when you log in and actually
gives you all the stuff decrypted so

295
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:18,290
first transcend the credentials that
compresses login this actually just the

296
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:24,260
username and password and go to the base
64 decode that basis for into an email

297
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:31,890
and password and then we're going to use
this last baby I found Python open

298
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:36,600
remote email password and the vault is
just that has all of your secrets and

299
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,840
are printed out for you

300
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,860
we'd catch exceptions if two factors
required it just as an exception it's

301
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,760
like oh you need Google authenticators
tells you exactly which to factory you

302
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,240
need either have to know the exact right
one otherwise we know it's an incorrect

303
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,900
password and then I can actually
redirect you back to the militias

304
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,700
landing page with saying invalid
passwords and actually does the exact

305
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,830
same thing last message doing even if
you type in the wrong password so if if

306
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,129
you have two factor authentication on
redirect you to this whole crazy thing

307
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:13,900
the only thing here is that I actually
pass along the email and password to

308
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,820
this I don't need to keep any state on
the server the server is it employs one

309
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,530
Python scripts need to store anything
like oh this is person sent me this very

310
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:27,178
easy victim then enters the two-factor
code and so they're gonna get this is

311
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,990
the two-factor code / the password very
easy straightforward this is just

312
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,679
something I cooked up you could make it
different API very easy then we're gonna

313
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:45,309
try and maintain access so good for 30
seconds you can use it we could add our

314
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:49,250
servers a trusted devices have the
special thing you can actually device

315
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,179
can maintain access for 30 days you can
disable two-factor authentication can

316
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:57,480
you actually have the code you could
download all the log in history you can

317
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,120
recover Deleted Items you disable
security policies

318
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:29,159
you do whatever you need ok so victim
server cover account and the first thing

319
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:39,830
to do is type in an incorrect password
is going to redirect to this and then

320
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:51,120
back here involve password is actually
using the real last ACPI right now I'd

321
00:26:51,120 --> 00:27:07,520
redirected to actually type in the real
code everybody please some similar

322
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:16,490
get redirected back to this page with
question mark why which means suppress

323
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,980
their education

324
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:25,200
easy but let's look over here to read
this so we can see we've got these name

325
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,170
password example test we got the
two-factor code and make this a little

326
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:41,010
bigger and here are all of the secret so
we have the username the password

327
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:46,379
website you can actually dumped
everything it's all here

328
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:53,470
yeah so that is grown and let me show
you

329
00:27:53,470 --> 00:28:04,950
Firefox yes so actually there's there's
a slight thing after the demo last

330
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,970
passes fix some of these problems and so
one of the things they've fixed is the

331
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:16,740
logout cross-site request forgery good
spot and question was the last pass I

332
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,180
can't do not turn red

333
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,670
that is true I can't actually log you in

334
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:27,150
into that so that the user might be
what's up last past why didn't I can

335
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:31,500
turn right but I've had last chance to
really funky things so I think it's not

336
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,610
crazy to suspected the user adjusting
click ability I guess it didn't work try

337
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:44,679
login again let me just do the Firefox
15 bucks one looks at the different

338
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:55,350
types up here as it even drags wow so
watch this I even did the windows 8 will

339
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,290
animation to see how it pops up

340
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:01,720
CSS animations

341
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:11,030
her feelings yeah so ok you know a lot
more to talk about so I was a demo ok

342
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:16,590
implications for what this means fishing
last past kind of like the worst case

343
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:21,830
scenario if you use LastPass shared
folders which is a new feature in the

344
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,939
premium or you could use enterprise only
one of your team members action needs to

345
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:31,340
be fished you might say smartest person
here I would never be fish but are you

346
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,659
gonna be sure that everyone on your team
is not going to fish or anyone you share

347
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,940
your passwords with our can be fished
and you really lose everything you lose

348
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,920
all of your passwords instantly as soon
as you type that and I have them already

349
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:49,890
your credit card you secure documents
everything is gone and the biggest thing

350
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,060
it's two factors of no help it doesn't
help you at all to factor which is you

351
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,440
know everyone's like oh yeah just used
to factor that into me i i can just use

352
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,080
it but we can talk a little bit more
about to factor later this is why

353
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,460
recommended to last pass block logins
from new IP addresses if you're really

354
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,940
experienced last best user you might say
they actually do this talk about that

355
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,560
don't display notifications the browser
window I think this is a really really

356
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,960
bad idea don't do it all in so they
actually have two styles of login

357
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,690
actually have the full web page login
and have the special pop-up dialog and

358
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:30,760
they use it seems like they use half and
half but if it is always used to pop up

359
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,690
style I can't draw that because that's
part of chrome I can't draw that you can

360
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:40,140
move to an HPS Extended Validation page
some of their competitors use this seems

361
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,430
to work ok I am NOT gonna try and fake
Extended Validation one you can

362
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:49,460
implement security image that's ok
really what I want to do is implement

363
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:55,440
protection properly so that you actually
can prevent cross-site request forgery

364
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,000
ease and really just making these are
experienced less buggy is going to

365
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,720
strike stop things like oded icon didn't
turn back to read and stuff like that

366
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,710
the response from last pass this is

367
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,059
kind of complicated long story I
contacted them in November I was

368
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:16,370
actually originally and contact them
earlier but talk about that in a minute

369
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:19,840
but it is some kind of communications
snafu they only got back to me in

370
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:26,389
December and immediately they kinda went
dark they said thanks for the bug I'm

371
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:29,649
like ok we're talking on this issue con
we should probably like work on this and

372
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:33,049
I didn't hear much which is very
uncommon last has a very very good

373
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:37,770
reputation for responding to people and
then this week I guess from a comment

374
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,139
coming up I got a lot of contact from
them and a lot of different message like

375
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,309
this is definitely a bug in LastPass
thanks for fixing it submitted to

376
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:48,899
Smith's about travel will pale and then
the gym of products like this is not a

377
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:55,070
vulnerability in LastPass and then they
were saying well we'll fix the logout

378
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,470
CSRF actually did that but we're not
what I can fix the notifications

379
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,190
indications are just part of last best
we can do it and then they were like

380
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,559
what's really krone's issue chrome
chrome eccentric protocol should be

381
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:10,950
protected by I agree that is the issue
but there was a lot of different stuff

382
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,080
here in LastPass to say I really like
these guys they're really honest nice

383
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,270
people and they really do wanna make
their users secure but this is really I

384
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,750
think a trend in our industry will take
fishing very seriously its and I think

385
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:29,490
that's that's what we're seeing here one
of the main responses from last passed

386
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,950
out was disestablished Howlett action
work it should not work at all because

387
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:38,140
of this when you log in from a new IP
address last message was to send you an

388
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,500
email saying hey you IP address to
confirm this

389
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,120
I had never seen this and they were like
your whole attack must not work because

390
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,629
of this feature we have maybe I'm just
terrible right i mean it literally says

391
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:54,409
we require users on new computers and
mobile devices and then I kept reading

392
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:58,460
the sentence unless they have
multi-factor authentication able to

393
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:04,670
so this has she brings us to a really
weird conclusion about it if you use

394
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:08,900
LastPass two-factor authentication makes
you less secure don't disable two-factor

395
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,040
authentication but this is really weird
conclusion right and really really

396
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,460
surprising nobody that would enable
two-factor authentication wants less

397
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:22,310
security that's literally so let's talk
about what what what they think so far

398
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:31,970
they fixed in chrome the logout see the
CSRF Firefox is still vulnerable chrome

399
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:36,180
now warns the user about leaking master
passwords to type in your master

400
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:42,380
password messaging hey you just type in
your password and what won't change for

401
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,350
now is there still gonna use it in
viewport notifications and the login

402
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,550
page still vulnerable we're still
talking about this but they're kind of

403
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,230
resistance changing it they've they
really want chrome to fix it and when I

404
00:33:53,230 --> 00:34:04,390
asked about Firefox Firefox Chrome
extension URL bar so I tried out the new

405
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,330
thing reaction typing master password
and it popped up a message and I hate

406
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:13,340
this site has the same password as your
last pass account and then I was like

407
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:18,470
well looks like they're just things same
thing in the in the browser so let's

408
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:25,250
write hacker tool right click inspect
element ok it's still in its I can still

409
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,520
detect this so now I have a thing that
if you type in your password and last

410
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,540
past tells you about it I instantly know
and I need to ask about it so as soon as

411
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,020
you type in your master password I can
add a tiny bit of javascript that then

412
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,120
says now I know your last past master
password because they're drawing in the

413
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,940
attackers can control that I can find it
so here I just popped up a thing here is

414
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,300
your email and password but I could have
instead of popping up the alert sent to

415
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,380
my server I can try to login I could do
whatever I wanted and the best part is I

416
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,340
can also suppress that message I can say
that the message I can suppress I can't

417
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,090
suppress the chrome one you can actually
see at the top rate I can't depressed at

418
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:08,360
one but I can suppress the one in the
browser's I just removed that and this

419
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,680
is why they have to get away using the
Chrome download

420
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:16,910
good using a browser indications good
and it's really why I think last passage

421
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:24,089
response is is the way it is they
exclude fishing as part of their dog

422
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:28,680
bounty program actually originally
wasn't going to even submitted but they

423
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,440
a friend of mine convince me to this is
not normal fishing and this is why I

424
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,260
think I'm saying this like really kind
of complicated on not well understood

425
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,880
response just because people aren't
well-trained if you get a remote code

426
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,390
execution exactly we need to do you need
to fix it but fishing it's a lot less

427
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:51,730
clear is it dumb users I don't want I
don't care about dumb users but like so

428
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:56,640
I it's not clear what medications for
users just ignore notifications just

429
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,790
always interact with the icon and be
good citizens premium and enterprise

430
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,750
applications you can enable IP
restrictions that not everyone can logon

431
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:09,390
you can disable mobile again which helps
only against my attack somebody else

432
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:14,629
could use the non mobile API I don't
mind just happens to use that log all

433
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,320
logins and login attempts failures last
batch makes it very easy probably

434
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,030
shouldn't disabled two-factor
authentication even though that makes it

435
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,290
is definitely do not want to recommend
that to you actually almost around the

436
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:30,920
IP restriction to since his last test
scores and accept text explains JSON via

437
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,900
post which is the backwards
compatibility thing to get around cross

438
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,120
things you intercept credentials to
issue an ajax request but you can't read

439
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,930
the response because of restrictions and
but we're super safe because browsers

440
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,160
have no bugs in cross border
restrictions except Firefox and had a

441
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,600
bug in crossword restrictions right as I
was making this if I had known about

442
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,509
this before Firefox it fix it I could
have used this gotten around the IP

443
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,660
address restrictions so that it was
actually your IP address for questioning

444
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:05,640
your last pass credentials so if you use
course that is another bit of Defense

445
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,580
you can have lessons for software
developers definitely Designer software

446
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:14,240
fishing in mind it is not your user's
fault you should be designing software

447
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,970
to itself be fishing resistance you can
add anti-phishing specific anti-phishing

448
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:24,169
measures don't use the viewport anything
you draw

449
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:28,319
can detect anything security-related I
can find out about it I can enumerate

450
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:32,349
all your different extensions and I can
interact with them I can remove them I

451
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:37,790
can replace them with my own non buggy
user experiences are really important

452
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:46,329
for software to fix low severity
security bugs I chained together a few

453
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:50,030
different low severity security bugs to
make this work like a lockout request

454
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,500
forgery usually is no big deal who cares
you're logged out but I used it as part

455
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,520
of a bigger ability chaining together
and I'll make it a high severity

456
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,759
vulnerability bug bounties are not going
to just fix all of your worries

457
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,760
automatically and really use cross
origin restrictions and check content

458
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,210
types it's it's it's worthwhile lets
users keep your secrets in one place is

459
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:16,040
dangerous making a fishing trip model is
really interesting if you're like ok

460
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,859
well my engineering users can get fish
is gonna have malicious code running on

461
00:38:20,859 --> 00:38:24,430
its his his computer what happens then

462
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:28,940
training is not enough I cannot stress
this enough really it is not good enough

463
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,410
we have to have software that
self-sufficient resistant you can buy

464
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:36,220
products are specifically fishing
resistant and just don't click on a

465
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:43,089
browser just don't use anymore just said
to me and for researchers I really think

466
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:46,230
phishing attacks me more attention I
think there's a lot of room here for

467
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,119
novel fishing tax news a lot of cool
stuff going on

468
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,280
anti-phishing research is still really
really early stages and user experience

469
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,200
is a critical part of your application
security and it's not all about

470
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,160
traditional exploits and the other scope
of this place chaim fallibility see

471
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,308
others just look at the list of
vulnerabilities are not gonna fix won't

472
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:11,549
leave you with one closing thought
another great quote give him a 90 day

473
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:16,530
and have access for day teach a man to
fish health access for life

474
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:22,810
the codes available get home so you can
check it out you know something about

475
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:32,279
him or my website any questions

476
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,760
the question was how I tested it with
you btw I don't have to be so no but it

477
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,590
should work with UV you became one of
the nice things about you because you

478
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:48,150
can't repeat them but because you're not
ever giving last pass the keycode you're

479
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,260
never using it twice so I'm using it in
your stead so it should work although I

480
00:39:52,260 --> 00:40:09,250
did not tested any other questions yes

481
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:14,240
so the question is who determines what's
offers fishing resistant the buyer has

482
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,919
to you have to then evaluate yourself I
know this was a lot of work on buyers

483
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,600
and hard to buy software but you have to
look for it you have to do your research

484
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,040
and find out is this software fishing
resistance like the latest latest

485
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,690
version of Office is a little more
fishing resistant the 2010 and I think

486
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:37,010
you should take that into account all
right I have time stop ok that's it

487
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,510
thank you very much
