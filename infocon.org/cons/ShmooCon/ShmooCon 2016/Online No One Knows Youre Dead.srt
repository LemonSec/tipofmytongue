1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,109
thanks for coming I'm glad that so many
does that mean for lipitor this better

2
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,230
get this where can wander so good
morning I'm and account thanks for

3
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,119
coming guys I'm glad that I can do a
talk about death and so many people show

4
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:39,769
up you sick twisted freaks this is a
test talk this is a very personal touch

5
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,820
on me but hopefully it will be valuable
to soyuz I will tell you I've got a

6
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:52,020
pretty dense deck and some of the deck
is a little dancer information but I'm

7
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,520
sure we will post it if not I'll be
happy get it to you and certainly share

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,859
with you any of the information that but
i wanna make sure that we have some time

9
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:05,360
for Q&A so certain certain portions I'm
gonna kinda maybe speed a little bit

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,340
through but so I will tell you that Who
I am is not all that important for this

11
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:19,460
particular talk I'm not really here to
sell anything or really promote myself

12
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,169
in any way in fact this is awkward talks
for me to give because it is talking

13
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,610
about a tragedy that that I was
personally involved with so but if you

14
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,420
want to know more about me I'm on the
twitters atler Galiardi and my buddy

15
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:44,000
Nigeria we do a podcast on let's move on
so couple of warnings this is not a fun

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,540
talk this is that I'll try to give you a
couple moments of levity to bring you up

17
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,030
but it's dark stuff but we like to think
it's important

18
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,930
there's gonna be a difficult topics
discussed that we don't like to think

19
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:03,460
about at least most of us and some
graphic but somewhat disturbing pictures

20
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,780
I will tell you that I am doing that on
purpose that I'm really trying to

21
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:15,170
connect with you guys to take away the
abstraction layer and to make you guys

22
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,910
understand as best like in emotionally
to understand that this is real and

23
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,910
these are real people and this could
happen to any of us so I'm gonna try to

24
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,680
manipulate your feelings a little bit ly
apologize for that but it's also wanna

25
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,930
let you know that these are real people
were talking about this is a real

26
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:38,120
situation that was put together with the
help of bethlehem headland who all talk

27
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,090
about a little bit she's the widow of
Michael Hamblin who is involved in this

28
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,750
incident

29
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:49,430
who I worked heavily with what this talk
is really about this was heavily debated

30
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:55,370
my mind whether I want to give the stock
but Beth courage that heavily pushed it

31
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,820
feels that this information is very
useful to share with everybody I would

32
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:08,350
not have done it without her support and
so quick disclaimers I am no

33
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:15,140
professional for lawyers EPA's financial
advisor investment advisor expert Joe

34
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,779
Wright's lawyer national director to
talk about things so please don't sue me

35
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:29,780
are we talking about we're talking about
governable Michael Hamlin who used to go

36
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,489
by the handle very heavily involved in
the community for many many years he was

37
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,610
part of the original kincho group which
did a lot of the capture flag contest at

38
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,070
DEFCON he'd been too many times

39
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:49,079
brilliant guy who was trained physicist
at CERN one of the smartest guys ever

40
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,540
know somebody i considered very very
close friend enjoy brother are brilliant

41
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,459
guy never sexually dirty work for many
different groups at different companies

42
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,150
did his own startup work

43
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:08,810
just before the accident left IBM where
he was very seniors strategist there and

44
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,250
got his first chief information security
officer job at a financial company

45
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,959
called green sky so really it I did a
lot of work in the community so you know

46
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:26,310
I'm not I'm not sure how many folks who
knew him and his wife also important to

47
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,250
know little about beth is that she's
also very smart she is a scientist for

48
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:38,260
the CDC but she's not a 90% that's kind
of the crux of this talk so very

49
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:49,229
intelligent individual but not and I T
person very much so what happened both

50
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:58,169
Michael best live in an area but they
have family taxes and so now and 2014

51
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:03,948
they were in Texas visiting family and
friends and they were driving along i-20

52
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:09,740
rental someone going the opposite
direction

53
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,199
lost consciousness we're not sure why
exactly across the grass median at

54
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,150
highway speeds and collided with their
vehicle and a friend offset crash

55
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:27,120
favoring the driver side as he said roe
versus Honda Accord the results were

56
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:38,900
fairly this is Michael is pretty much
killed this feeling that was pretty

57
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:46,698
banged up she had a broken ankle pretty
heavy concussions in relations but

58
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:52,000
thrived it was life flighted out this is
the other vehicle the other driver

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,740
survived with only minor injuries also
the hospital but not not unfortunately

60
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,840
they're far away from everybody when
this happen

61
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,289
Beth was life flighted to a nearby
hospital and was basically alone at that

62
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:14,530
point so they're thousand miles from
home

63
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:21,539
there in this accident and beth is now
basically on her own in the ICU and

64
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:26,050
hospital but no way to get hold of
anybody the person that was expecting

65
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,440
them notice they were overdue after
about an hour or two after their do

66
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,000
actually pulled up

67
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,159
find friends at his iPhone in had the
ability to track Michael's phone and

68
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:41,120
notice that Michael's phone was sitting
along the side of i-20 was still in the

69
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,740
vehicle along with actually everything
else they had and was moving checked

70
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,139
again after about 20 minutes still
wasn't moving he eventually called the

71
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,169
police

72
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:56,039
inclined to access and found out about
the accident and that's how somebody

73
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,900
finally found both know what's
interesting about this is that do not

74
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:06,729
have a phone didn't have anything on her
and wants her friend Bill got to the

75
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,120
hospital

76
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,430
an interesting thing came out of this is
one of the first lessons learned from

77
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:19,039
this is that we don't memorize phone
numbers anymore so she had had no

78
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,830
contact information she had no way to
get hold of it when she was you know

79
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,870
conscious again and needed to start
reaching out to friends and family

80
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,319
fortunately did have an iPad it when she
was able to log in with her iCloud

81
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,120
account she was able to get access to
our online contact book but it's

82
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,009
interesting that we don't memorize phone
numbers so it was a difficult way to

83
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:45,020
engage so she was able to get online

84
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,630
she was able to find a phone number of
one of her brothers websites who had a

85
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,949
business it was able to reach out to her
brother's business even those ads

86
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:57,000
Saturday or Sunday somebody was working
and got a hold of somebody knows where

87
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,800
she was able to contact family again
she's not only is she out of state but

88
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,639
she's also many miles away from family
even in texts the other thing was

89
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,660
interesting is how social media became

90
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:15,750
conduit for communication when something
like this happens and how quickly that

91
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:24,310
spreads wants to know what you know at
this point is now beth is in the

92
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,190
hospital

93
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:31,400
Michael is no longer with us and now
we're trying to pick up the pieces so

94
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,809
when the first things is there in a trip
and they live in Atlanta but they've got

95
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:43,380
their car in park and fly in Atlanta and
this is one of the first things that we

96
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,980
found we started engaging so i'm i'm
trying to help from atlanta and one of

97
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,190
the first things asked me to take me go
get her car at a park and fly well it's

98
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,900
really interesting when you reach out to
these companies they have no idea how to

99
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,620
deal with this situation and this is
something we saw over and over again

100
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:07,330
which is that there's very little policy
or any way that these guys know how to

101
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,380
deal with this so I probably called park
and fly up and down the corporate chain

102
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:18,670
a dozen times local league corporate
local headquarters couldn't get anyone

103
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:24,420
engaged in till I threw a tweet out
calling them out and it's funny how

104
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,849
quickly that worked within an hour I had
a senior manager engaged and we have the

105
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:36,950
car within it within about five hours
but what we found was there was very

106
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,880
little procedure they didn't know how to
deal with this situation and that is

107
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,470
something that we saw throughout this
situation is that very few companies

108
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:52,339
know how to deal with the unexpected
death of a client so

109
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:59,360
we finally get past a little bit and end
and you know we're starting now to to

110
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,689
get better at home and now we've gotta
figure out what the heck do we do with

111
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:12,199
my goals ITV which was massive and
you're going to see some pictures but

112
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:18,389
Michael was incredibly involved with all
aspects of I T not only was he working

113
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:23,819
professionally nighty security but he
had a bunch of side businesses and he

114
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:29,639
had stuff to colo he had 10 boxes up and
running at a colo he had a bunch of I T

115
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,999
here at home and again going back to
remind you about bath very smart but not

116
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:39,620
I T at all and so part of the lesson
here will talk about his at everything I

117
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:46,040
T related Michael did and there was
extensive amount of idea that we had to

118
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,990
go through so he had huge manage email
personal domain registry was operating

119
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,279
with a bunch of collocated servers and a
colo in the Atlanta area was doing

120
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,819
hosting on the side of a bunch of staff
had a townhome servers and pretty much

121
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:03,670
everything Apple ever made

122
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,878
Michael still had a chakra still selling
off their gear if you want something

123
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:15,399
from circa 1972 it's probably in the
idea or there were going through we had

124
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:21,420
the search was going on you know once
the initial shock is over the brutal

125
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,050
realities life goes on whether we're
ready for it whether we like it or not

126
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,628
we still have duties and tasks and
responsibilities that we've gotta

127
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:34,209
continue on with the letter what's going
on in the world

128
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:38,709
the world doesn't care we're going
through this trauma and grief and shock

129
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:47,349
you got it figured out so back home and
even the basics are a struggle has

130
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:53,079
happened many many times when you've got
a strong I T personality they do all

131
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:58,388
this stuff because they love it and so
bath really through no fault of Michael

132
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:04,699
had no real insight into how any of the
idea was set up even in their home to

133
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:09,490
the point where again all of their gear
in the car was in essence gone or

134
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:15,860
destroyed so bad had to go get a new
phone she couldn't get it on the wifi

135
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,579
because she didn't know the wifi
password up because she wasn't smart

136
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:25,069
enough but that's just what Michael did
he owned it and he loved it so you know

137
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:29,259
one of the cause of death was you know
what they think is asking other words

138
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:33,790
they being US Soccer types is torture to
someone in this situation who doesn't

139
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,920
know how it's setup so she's already in
a really stressful grief-stricken

140
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,139
situation and she can't even get the
basics so this also apply to a lot of

141
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:50,439
the household logistics paying the bills
mortgage paying any you know the

142
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:55,290
electric bill of the gas bill all this
was done by Michael and and batted

143
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:00,618
sugarless out it was also all set up
pretty much autonomy online now here's

144
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:06,339
the problem that we ran into is
everything michael had had pretty much

145
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:13,369
the maximum level of security turned on
so if we wanted to secure

146
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:22,160
recovers passwords to his email account
will start looking at this stuff so we

147
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,939
almost had to do some

148
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:29,139
forensics around their training even
just to pay the bills we started

149
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:32,339
grabbing credit card statements one
thing mike was good about paper copies

150
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:35,039
which was odd

151
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:40,519
the problem was in the paper copies of
all these credit card statements that

152
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,119
credit card numbers are no longer prison
for most of them and we start calling

153
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:49,119
all these different services they want
the full credit card number of the

154
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:54,629
credit cards they were destroyed the
crash so these little things or just

155
00:13:54,629 --> 00:14:03,289
huge challenge at no point did my goal
really share this with best not have any

156
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:07,659
malicious he wasn't trying to hide it
wasn't trying to be controlling just the

157
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:14,199
way their household worked because he
was that guy and you know I just say I'm

158
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:19,459
engaged wonderful fiance at home and I
had a lot of this stuff mind you after

159
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:24,878
this experience were gonna but I think
this is pretty typical but almost

160
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,499
everything was probably built a list
everything was set up for paper records

161
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:33,709
very few people records but we had to
figure all this out even just to get

162
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:40,258
stuff going through some of the basics
then we started looking at as Colo

163
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:43,349
he's got customers at this Colo

164
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,499
so he's got servers are running at the
school oh he's got customers on the

165
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:53,359
servers we didn't even know who they
were we reached out to the color and we

166
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:58,399
tried to explain the situation again no
procedure built for this sort of

167
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,199
situation at all and it became a very
personal sort of project with these guys

168
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:09,848
typically what would happen is Beth
would have to recharge rushed and she

169
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:17,459
would explain hi my husband is dead and
I need your help

170
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,709
there would be silenced and difficulty
and the other in the phone trying to get

171
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:27,029
the arms room that eventually we did
start to get some traction and she got

172
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:32,429
me authorized to go in there to figure
was going on and how to call the blocks

173
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:37,689
which was the colo over in atlanta that
once we sort of got them convinced this

174
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:42,529
wasn't a scam in this wasn't anything
you know areas they really did work with

175
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:46,589
us to the promised me no idea what we
were looking to give an idea here some

176
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:52,639
of the pictures of these five servers
are up and running at the colo

177
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:59,639
what is all this stuff so we took a
crash cart which fortunately everything

178
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:08,490
had videos and stuff 13 ESX boxes two
different Linux boxes nothing the same

179
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,369
we've a good idea 10 activities and we
started again forensically triggered all

180
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:16,980
this stuff was so we could figure out
who to contact

181
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,769
tell them hey we're gonna have to
basically turn off your mind this is

182
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:25,199
costing a lot of money because this is
expensive

183
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,199
running at a colo and are charging every
month so we started building these of

184
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:34,258
the crash current and figure it out what
they have briefly go through this but

185
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:43,920
you know here sent us 46 VMware ESX 3150
again all over the map of what he had a

186
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,639
running on these apparently he didn't
ever like during the same thing anywhere

187
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:53,869
because it would make life too easy for
us and ultimately we had to figure out a

188
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:57,420
way to break into all the servers
clearly had a passwords that was written

189
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,519
down so you know the typical stuff that
you probably imagine we figure out what

190
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,480
they were doing we created the buddhists
we blew it off those you there are a CD

191
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,470
or a blu-ray or a USB stick and and
typically reset the passwords Guardian

192
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,500
figured out what was on these boxes
figured out the various services are

193
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,260
running and then using that figure out
how to contact the customers who were on

194
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,549
these boxes hey we've got to move your
your service employees else because

195
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:30,320
michael's no longer with us and we don't
wanna keep running the service

196
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:37,389
interesting info know it really reset
the password officially you have to

197
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:42,110
actually reinstall yet excited to
recover to get into the guest OS is

198
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:53,100
there some unofficial methodologies but
that was official to reinstall which was

199
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:59,059
a pain we found out that he had ten
domains registered with the register

200
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:07,678
we found this from credit card bill hey
who's this interesting again reached out

201
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,809
to them that's called first and stunned
silence on the other

202
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:16,899
not sure how to deal with this problem
but they were actually very

203
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:23,489
accommodating and very quickly reset the
password and we read they were ones who

204
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,630
talk about this later

205
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:33,309
certain social engineering opportunities
present themselves when you play this

206
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:39,908
particular card but will be nice but we
found enemies most of them were related

207
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:45,240
to colo or personal projects that
Michael had going two of them were stuff

208
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,789
we had to keep up and running one was
actually for best

209
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:53,190
any domain that she used and also had a
brother whose business was operating on

210
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:57,529
this and we have been transferred out so
again really just traveling all these

211
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:02,029
things am I glad going so that there was
a disruption of folks are relying on

212
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:09,289
this but we had no idea where this stuff
was we had to figure it out now will

213
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:15,479
talk about the home infrastructure and I
want to think for a moment that

214
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:17,570
everything you know about I T

215
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:24,570
you don't know and you've just gone
through this trauma to the memorial your

216
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,499
back in Atlanta and now you're faced
with all of this year it's up and

217
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:34,529
running in the house and have no idea
what it is like to give you a little bit

218
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:39,999
of a taste of that you walk in and you
start looking at stuff like this racks

219
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:49,650
and racks and shelves and shelves

220
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:56,040
and this this is probably a half of it
you know

221
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,980
wearing closets like this you know for
sure is as what's already known as my

222
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,600
goal was probably despairing driven
crazy but that's what it was you know

223
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,060
tons of this year so you know

224
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:21,179
reacted like this the situation but we
had to figure out first of all we don't

225
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,180
know if there's other businesses being
run of the house we don't know

226
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:35,130
and here's a key thing that I want to
mention all of Michael's his match every

227
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,010
single box he had with it was his
MacBook Pro whether it was his Mac minis

228
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:48,570
all had full description that had no
access to any of their shared memories

229
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:56,570
their photos their documents and so
their entire life together that was

230
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:02,220
digital was contained in these encrypted
her dress and I'll give you a spoiler

231
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,820
warning we never got them back

232
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,230
we tried we're still trying we we
actually found a three-year-old archived

233
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:19,660
on a Drobo that we eventually found like
three months ago but the MacBooks magnet

234
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:30,750
everything had full description now ok
we'll deal with it and his own apple and

235
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,490
many others have a pretty harsh policy
about this and they should for security

236
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,640
reasons it's really difficult to recover
this stuff if you don't have key thinks

237
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,400
he's got a lot of different options are
you can have a recovery key or your

238
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,870
passwords set up to the Apple iCloud
account however if you don't have access

239
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:54,129
account it's really difficult to get
that so he said ok let's let's let's

240
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,050
figure out what is iCloud account was
tied to its start back here way into

241
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,510
that well we figured out he had an apple
dot com account of what it was tied to

242
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:06,370
is tied to one of his domains which we
had actually shut down so we should that

243
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:11,189
back up and we started getting email to
him he said ok all right we'll go on

244
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,980
apple.com inland

245
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:21,050
great you've got two-step verification
necessary to recent this so to do that

246
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:27,800
we need two or three things the Apple
password we need access to address the

247
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,750
device and/or recovery key promise we
had none of these

248
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,710
get into any of the transfer devices his
phone keep in mind gone destroyed

249
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:41,590
basically when we got back later but it
had been shut down the account his phone

250
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,629
account had been shut down and this is a
key lesson we probably should not have

251
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,790
done that if he left his phone account
up and running we probably could have

252
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:54,159
gotten at least an SMS recovery he sent
the phone which might have helped but we

253
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,470
didn't have that created his iPad
couldn't get into any of the computers

254
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,330
show

255
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,100
we had no real way to us in Apple has a
policy of there's no right of

256
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,668
survivorship so in essence apple says
hey I understand that you're married to

257
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:14,260
the person frankly that's how we do
things and we find that across the board

258
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,340
for different sort of organizations that
they have noticed the key thing here is

259
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:28,928
that that's fine unless you want stuff
needs stuff that's on that computer so

260
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:36,700
we counts and I like to think that I'm
fairly savvy about 80 security things

261
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:41,720
but there's really no way because we the
way that these systems are set up a very

262
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,539
strong and it requires at least some
aspect of trusted devices and we had and

263
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:52,179
frankly Apple's sorry we're not going to
give that to you that's just the way it

264
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:52,730
is

265
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:59,710
guys we feel that but I can happen so we
did have a phone the phone number was

266
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:06,179
gone but we finally got the phone back
operational but we could never get the

267
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:10,830
phone number operation get down here is
another interesting aspect about Apple

268
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:19,019
iPhones because of anti theft from Apple
until you can prove that you bought it

269
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:24,830
and awards show every seat of ownership
they will not clear that phone and give

270
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:31,830
it to so we could never really get that
sold truly set back to factory reset to

271
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,389
factory because of anti theft with Apple
to YouTube ownership they will not truly

272
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:42,990
white that we could never get that phone
truly clear to resign

273
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:50,100
so unfortunately we were left with the
situation a fail we just couldn't get

274
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,389
into those boxes which was really
disheartening you know better tell you

275
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,660
now that she's kind of gotten over that
moved on and you know it's a year and a

276
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:04,040
half later and she's dealing with it but
for me it really sucked him and I'm

277
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,450
trying to help this grieving widow
friend of mine somebody who I consider

278
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:18,500
basically family and my gana probably
knows boxes financially everything was

279
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:23,230
all over the board to again nothing
malicious here but Michael handled most

280
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:29,390
the finances on his own and it was all
over the map we still found a new

281
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:36,440
account two months ago that we know
about because the staff just wasn't

282
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,300
documented and when you're in this
situation obviously practical aspects of

283
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:49,550
finances matter so fortunately you know
they did they were destitute or anything

284
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:55,080
like that but issued a lot of work to go
track all this stuff down and then get

285
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,760
things transferred over including not
easy especially when you don't know what

286
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,240
you're looking for another interesting
story was the airline miles and I can't

287
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,340
mention who the airline is because I
don't get you in trouble but this is a

288
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:15,659
good example of these things that we
think are valuable don't really transfer

289
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:21,429
may not do that so my goal was a heavy
heavy world traveler he had over 1.6

290
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:27,520
million miles banked which i think we
calculated at the time was worth about

291
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,799
$60,000

292
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:37,289
and basis but airline told Beth sorry so
sad too bad you can't have them which is

293
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:45,570
their policy and that's fine but you
would think somebody who was the highest

294
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:50,189
status on this airline in a situation
like this that they would perhaps be a

295
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:56,499
little more comedy to the draft family
wanting we found in this is something we

296
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:57,539
found over and over again

297
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,779
fortunately I had a friend who have to
work in the department of that

298
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:04,269
particular airline I reach out to them
explain the situation is and that's

299
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:08,759
ridiculous I know the head of the
loyalty program I'll be right back and

300
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:13,669
they walked down two flights of stairs
and an hour later we had a resolution so

301
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:23,679
and so now they're fuckin can travel
like but it's interesting how the friend

302
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,649
factor played into this reaching out to
folks who know things in fact if I would

303
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:33,799
have probably somebody who was a little
more senior at Apple I probably could

304
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:39,320
have gotten through some of the Apple
problems as well but I didn't really

305
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,789
quickly just one of a kind of talk about
some of the major online accounts and

306
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:48,480
their policies because of a varied
Google for instance when people pass

307
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,559
away that's terrible we're sorry there
are certain things we can do for you

308
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:56,950
however we do consider that account
private to that individual and you don't

309
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:01,090
have a right to it now if you need
something specific maybe we'll take a

310
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:05,509
look at it maybe we can get it to you
but in general not just gonna reason and

311
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:10,460
you could say hey that's a good thing
that that that is what maybe it should

312
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,359
be but no circumstance where you need
something they do have this forum hey

313
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,658
this is what we need in sending the
death certificate I will tell you we

314
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:22,620
tried this never ever heard back from we
tried two times

315
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:28,300
could never really get them they do have
something interesting and now the key

316
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,870
thing I'm gonna talk about all these is
you've gotta get this ahead of time if

317
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,120
you're in the circumstance it's too late
it's kind of like doing you know re-try

318
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,219
spots if you're in the breach its too
late if you set this to google has

319
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,809
actively Account Manager the concept is
if they detect that your account is

320
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:51,180
inactive for a period of time you can
basically desert to rule over to

321
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,530
somebody else which is interesting

322
00:28:53,530 --> 00:29:01,540
Facebook has a little bit different
policy of a moralizing accounts where

323
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:07,100
you can basically take active users
account and rolled over to an online

324
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,510
memorial so there's things you you know
they can still post their friends and

325
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:17,660
family and they can interact with each
other and share stories but it doesn't

326
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:22,000
appear committed friends birthdays ads
which is kind of creepy somebody pops up

327
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,940
and says hey it's that they've been dead
three years thinks Facebook no one can

328
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:33,410
log into it the content stays or you can
put down if you want

329
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:37,430
if you so choose what's interesting is
all of these accounts that have become

330
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:43,900
show pervasive in our society are still
sort of getting our arms around how they

331
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:49,320
deal with it when their members died how
the families want to deal with it you

332
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,860
can also delete you gotta prove it

333
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,850
your immediate family member in death
one thing we learned is that the more

334
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,270
copies of the death certificate you have
the better off you are which is a really

335
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,510
really thing to say but we went through
a lot of copies the death certificate

336
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:09,430
facebook also has the ability to
designate a legacy contact again ahead

337
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:20,670
of time if I were to die this is the
person I want to take over my account so

338
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:26,700
they're kinda get what they want to do
with that Twitter has a different policy

339
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:33,430
basically hate die that's terrible we're
sorry we can be safely removed images or

340
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:44,100
we can shut down the county approved
with Microsoft different basically like

341
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:54,590
a died we'll send you a bunch of CDs in
Blu rays in touch with their there

342
00:30:54,590 --> 00:31:00,439
they're not really concerned about now
but they send it to you

343
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:10,520
we have too much we need to grab I will
say it's a very odd saying our online

344
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:19,160
world where his way out of active social
this was three months ago it was

345
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:26,540
Michael's would have been his one-year
anniversary and I browsed through

346
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:40,270
LinkedIn see which recruiter that day
and I see this as baby thanks linden so

347
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:45,160
what they gonna talk about privacy
issues we're going to kind of get into

348
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:51,500
recommendations and lessons learned here
not everything that somebody has is

349
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,900
meant to be recovered they have the
right to say hey I don't want you

350
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:06,370
finding my weird dungeon porn and that
that is their choice and I'm not trying

351
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:10,760
to argue that everything that we have
should be recoverable after what I am

352
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:18,190
saying we don't think about archie
formation that with her spouse that's

353
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:23,900
gonna go age and so in this case a whole
bunch of financial information shared

354
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:33,040
memories photos of documents the way
that their life so that's the point i'm

355
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,830
trying to point out here and there's
things we can do

356
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:46,418
to avoid overall and we're going to do
then slides recommendations to make sure

357
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:55,480
what I would say is in our society still
trying to catch up with the technology

358
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:02,159
side of our life when it comes to death
which still trick we had a pretty well

359
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,820
figured out with physical property we
had a pretty well figured out with

360
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,539
business we haven't quite

361
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:16,899
digital and quickly especially from all
the security stuff that we've built into

362
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:18,449
the bad guys out great

363
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:26,380
Sep 24 loved ones out an emergency so
the one thing we showed is that having a

364
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,980
grieving widow calling company say I'm
sorry my husband was killed and I need

365
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:38,700
you to help me work so be nice social
engineers to really mean card to play

366
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:46,210
but it's interesting how we believe even
without a district would you get big

367
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:53,350
companies they want but just work we
found that aside from real big companies

368
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,399
very few companies have a policy to deal
with this

369
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,549
everything wasn't Wow don't know what to
do

370
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:05,389
manager eventually they would do the
right but it took a lot of work and a

371
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:09,730
lot of pretty young thing we found is
that better having the same last name

372
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:15,219
was really really helpful if she had had
a different last name it would have

373
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:19,080
thrown for more roadblocks especially in
the financial accounts all the different

374
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,750
financial so I'm not arguing anything
for changing lessons or not but I will

375
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,730
tell you that it really

376
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,990
I would say that

377
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:35,799
talking to our partners and making sure
they can continue and run life after we

378
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,590
unexpectedly go away is a form of love
and leaving them unprepared

379
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:48,250
intentionally or otherwise is not the
best thing to do so getting his very

380
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:56,119
specific tactical recommendations I
would recommend these things first we'll

381
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,530
make sure you have a will

382
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,990
without a Will life is much more
difficult to talk about something called

383
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:07,990
legacy tour which I still shamelessly
from Dave Ramsey dot com one thing

384
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:12,100
though that I like to talk about this
picture slide is make sure that you are

385
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:17,540
switching roles in your household at
least for one month per year I means the

386
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,040
other person pays the bills

387
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,350
logs into the account the other person
at a check on them you know financial

388
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:29,980
accounts they know how life works in
your household and you're not doing it

389
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,130
all one of the other now it's great that
you have patrols and you share the

390
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:36,670
duties but both people need to know how
to do everything

391
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:46,740
somebody's incapacity has recovery keys
this is a test Harvick by if we are

392
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,859
married I would like to think we trust
the pressure married people do not

393
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:53,110
judging

394
00:35:53,110 --> 00:36:03,120
having a shared spot for past recoveries
is really a passer-by talk about so I'm

395
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:09,180
not interested in using we learned his
life insurance

396
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,109
keep in mind that Michael had switched
jobs a month before the accident

397
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:21,190
a lot of times life insurance so we get
a financial advisor but I do recommend

398
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:27,150
not having insurance tied with
transition we die

399
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:33,770
you may not have any life insurance and
your spouse's look at that point so some

400
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:37,509
recommend 10 times your life

401
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:42,290
do you talk to your browser it's pretty
inexpensive and easy to maintain they

402
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:46,029
don't have to worry about your
employment status when it comes to your

403
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:51,340
families take care of the other thing is
that if you've got shared visual

404
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,280
memories don't put him on a full disk
encryption driving nobody else can get

405
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,220
into because we can't get into it

406
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,810
try to put them someplace we can get him
he came up as I was talking about this

407
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,340
as a good option

408
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:09,820
putting a bunch of your critical stuff
on an IronKey passwords encrypted making

409
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:15,560
sure your spouse has something along
those lines of waited to get to that is

410
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:21,950
one just one option chillin a little bit
into this other things I would say make

411
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,299
sure your spouse knows how to do the
critical stuff in your house stuff like

412
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,650
turning off the gas electric water at
the local junction boxes in your house

413
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:35,240
just making sure they know the basics I
know that

414
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,060
saying there's any specific gender roles
here but men typically take care of this

415
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:45,119
stuff out of my friends house so I make
sure that my fiance knows how to do this

416
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,930
stuff if I'm traveling which I do alot i
wanna make sure she knows how to turn

417
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:54,569
off the gas now electricity so I equip
them to be able to run the house if I'm

418
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:59,390
not there I would say be careful with
any sort of biometric authentication

419
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:04,040
obviously if somebody's dead unless
you're really grizzly you don't have

420
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:11,050
their biometrics sci-fi excluded if
you're doing side businesses maybe write

421
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:14,690
that down somewhere please be helpful

422
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,890
make sure both people on all the
financial accounts i mean again assuming

423
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,339
you're not hiding money in Kuala Lumpur
for your third family that we don't talk

424
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,230
about its money wanna share make sure
everybody else really makes life alot

425
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,920
easier getting somebody added to
financial account after somebody's day

426
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,980
harder than you think it is the last
thing you want to deal with when you

427
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:42,420
know you've got beneficiaries siders
accounts lol say is emergency cash there

428
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,730
are very few problems in life that are
made worse by having money available to

429
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:52,490
you so not having to worry about flying
back and forth keeping things up and

430
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:58,060
running and just having cash that was
stuck in a in a hospital and taxes in

431
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:06,549
the ICU with no phone being able to have
made life a lot easier so having some

432
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:12,330
cash available for emergencies is
definitely helpful me sir I mentioned

433
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:16,700
briefly legacy during this is kind of a
centralized place to put all your

434
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,470
important documents the concept being if
something would happen if not one place

435
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:24,629
to go for everything that they need
again it it's not fun

436
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,950
nobody wants to do this but if your
spouse is in this situation this takes

437
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,230
so much lower

438
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,140
em while they're dealing with their
grief so which is essentially spot for

439
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,990
wills estate plans are your financial
account information again and other

440
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:45,939
things like institution account number
the password specific instructions

441
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:51,630
insurance policies important documents
each titles for the house of horrors you

442
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,830
know in a centralized spot important
documents like that previous year's tax

443
00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:01,720
return just how did you taxes has been a
challenge because it was something

444
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,180
michael has had had done with all the
passwords contact info you know if you

445
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:12,460
get lawyers EPA's against such a deposit
box however you do a safe deposit box

446
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:19,350
picture both people have keys if the
keys destroy this doesn't receive that

447
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:26,490
kind of thing again just a centralized
by a year I don't laugh a minute but

448
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:32,229
does matter this is something we just
added this month which is kinda cool

449
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:38,760
last pass which is a better manager has
a concept of emergency access this place

450
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:44,720
worldwide topic concept is is something
were to happen you could have pre

451
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,250
designated somebody to get access to
your for last pass or portions thereof

452
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:56,950
and the concept is hey you know i i give
it to my friend Baban Bob thinking

453
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:03,990
requested I have a period of time that
it does get access that their access

454
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:09,129
which is kind of Hindi and by the way in
general I do recommend as saying last

455
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:12,320
pass or anybody else's better but
they're good things to have this would

456
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,900
make life alot easier if michael had a
centralized we could have saved months

457
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,030
and months and months and months of work

458
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,940
somebody not associate with one Password
put something somewhere together which

459
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:32,280
was kind of cool I just found the
searching the web for credit him but

460
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,359
it's an emergency kit that is really
just a little template he put together

461
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:39,810
to say hey if something happens to me
here's a single document

462
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:45,259
that gives his wife on the instruction
she needs to get the basics done so you

463
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,840
know I know it's kind of small print but
the basics are hey use the password to

464
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,710
my one password account here's the pin
to my phone

465
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:57,380
here's the pin to this and here's the
basics to least get her going even

466
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:05,550
emergency examples like this so here's
another home I D recommendations that

467
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:12,090
may be a simple network map just kidding
Beth back online when she got back home

468
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:15,650
was a huge with everything going on

469
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,830
label to gear I travel a lot and I've
got labels on all my gear like cable

470
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:27,100
modem wireless access point router and
so something would happen is very easy

471
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,920
to trace it out or traveling

472
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,339
answer calls me and says something's
broken I can go find the box labeled

473
00:42:33,339 --> 00:42:39,299
this pull the plug and play back in and
keep it uncomplicated you might have a

474
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:43,480
huge lab that you wanna Ryan which is
great but maybe make there is an

475
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,990
offshoot of the critical gear in the
words the home network should be fairly

476
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:52,779
straightforward so that people can use
it fairly easily and are having to get

477
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:59,450
ESX servers are running just to get out
to the internet on the final thoughts

478
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:06,359
and I wanted to leave time for in
circumstances like this the next of kin

479
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:12,328
are under a lot of pressure and stress
there are things we can do to make it

480
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:17,760
easier for them that's kind of what
we're talking about here I will tell you

481
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,880
our time here is unknown

482
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,319
Michael bath certainly had no idea when
they got in the car that morning that

483
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:32,259
was the last day michael's with us and
that had a profound impact on my life so

484
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,569
we don't know how long I do think it's
important that we make that time I know

485
00:43:37,569 --> 00:43:42,599
it's not fun but I do think it's
important to talk to reporters about and

486
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:47,490
what we would do in making sure that we
have cared for them to continue on

487
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,919
because whether we like it or not

488
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,059
life does continue and I would say you
know think about what would happen and

489
00:43:54,059 --> 00:44:01,099
what you can do to help so just one more
quote in there will be up to you and

490
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:09,829
everybody's got a reference but I do
want to open up to questions got some

491
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:14,339
time before I do that I do want to
introduce one of the person who was kind

492
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:19,270
of come up which is a better man came up
to talk so she was come up we can answer

493
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:48,900
some questions we got some time

494
00:44:48,900 --> 00:45:22,140
the comment was will return part of a
trust really critical for making a lot

495
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:31,410
about trust so I don't know what about
all the legal stuff here but other

496
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:35,290
questions comments

497
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:52,600
so the question is would have been
helpful helpful beforehand and one in a

498
00:45:52,600 --> 00:46:04,270
state planners attorney Ben been useful
can you hear me to my thoughts on that

499
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:09,960
are yes it could have been helpful from
financial perspective but most people

500
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,330
don't think when they're discussing with
estate planning their passwords to all

501
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:18,930
of their gear so although that would
have made it smoother financial

502
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:22,839
perspective and transfers and everything
else I don't think that that necessarily

503
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:31,900
would have addressed the issues with all
the idea here that we're an engine

504
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:57,869
the question do we have to think about
so you know the one thing like what

505
00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:03,529
last past it without emergency contact
so I see some closure to catch up with

506
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:37,329
us but that's a huge question without
implications think about that

507
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:45,730
sales guys are using terms Hills droid
who call themselves estate planner short

508
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,839
just selling your product is very
careful about that go to a good lawyer

509
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:50,578
not a sales guy

510
00:47:50,579 --> 00:48:00,280
lawyers who specialize in it

511
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:16,260
lawyers typically only respect the power
of attorney for about six months so it's

512
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:45,130
a time-critical the other thing is that
you're not married this is a lot more

513
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:50,190
difficult so if your domestic partner
that sort of thing life is definitely a

514
00:48:50,190 --> 00:49:01,880
difficult time speaker but happy to take
in a few more ok so you're not married

515
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,970
financial power of attorney and direct
power attorneys recommended and medical

516
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:17,950
power of attorney share but go ahead

517
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:33,799
point again when someone is dead the
power of attorney sometimes loses

518
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:42,250
effectiveness so it's great for live i'm
happy to take as many questions again

519
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,530
but I never gonna kick off the stage in
a minute

520
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:55,490
rally someplace else but go ahead

521
00:49:55,490 --> 00:50:02,740
good question why why would I recommend
a password manager just riding passenger

522
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:07,109
on a website and I will tell you that
this is a careful balance of forces

523
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:10,950
accessibility the reason why I like the
password manager in this particular

524
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:15,919
circumstances it's a central place
second only to be reachable the matter

525
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,930
where I want to find a favor and I like
the fact that I can be customized

526
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:24,020
passwords in store then rotate them
easily and as a manager but you bring up

527
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,240
a good point is also a central point of
attack that somebody breaches my

528
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,000
password manager they've got my entire
life she got a secure that very very

529
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,950
carefully but it's it's about a risk so
I apologize I'd like to talk anymore

530
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,580
haven't talked in the hallway better
I'll be here for a while but they're

531
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,810
kicking off the stage to thank you very
much appreciated
