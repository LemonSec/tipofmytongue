1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,599
with that are we getting taping team
awesome so for stock today is our

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:22,759
cameras and Trey hair on making mill
we're looking for

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,490
alright we're gonna talk about this is
making nowhere and interdisciplinary

4
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,989
juris why the hell did call that we
attempted to do about a year ago I'm

5
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:36,828
global science students erica is a
computer science student these two

6
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,320
things are usually like oil and water
don't mesh really well different value

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,649
systems in the discipline is different

8
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:45,460
intense what we're trying to explain and
there's radically different

9
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,010
methodologies so what we're trying to do
is to come together and explain or tried

10
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,519
to get there is a consistent
differentiation between state-of-the-art

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,510
code and non-state other code that we
are trying to get past the sort of apps

12
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,740
moniker for everything my interest was
not an attack initially right looking at

13
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,850
platforms like Dooku internal flame and
Stuxnet I wanted to be able to see if

14
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,259
there were implications from that states
were building these sorts and advanced

15
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:21,280
espionage platforms more consistently
and this was becoming a legitimate tool

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,860
estate interaction with each other and
with non-state groups the thinking was

17
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,679
that if you can establish that there is
a differentiation between state and

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,420
non-state stuff you can then start to do
work on what the implications of that

19
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,200
work right I was not interested in you
know the behind the scenes by and we

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:49,399
went forward that actually became the
religion part so despite rest he said I

21
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:56,460
like CES in January GWU and I like
assembly assembly

22
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:04,740
yeah so yeah my interest is again
working the policy due to try and come

23
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,780
to some middle ground where I can be
like yeah I know you don't understand

24
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,930
what movie actually you know useless but
still is so we want to try and come some

25
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,690
middle ground and I figured I can speak
some policy stuff I'm at home so I

26
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,040
entire PC candidate little science HW I
work with numerical cybersecurity

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,019
initiative to do some policy focused and
I'm like a total neophyte translator

28
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:35,340
died I helped run a briefing series on
the hill she had declared yesterday what

29
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,570
we tried to do was to bring some of
these concepts into the room with LA's

30
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:43,090
Elddis you explain to them that cyber is
not a thing that we're talking about

31
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,320
information security standards
information assurance problem it's

32
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,549
different from when you're talking about
cyber crime legislation right and it's

33
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,430
different when you're talking about the
see a system that gets going so we tried

34
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,890
to bring a little bit more nuanced in
that discussion in this is going to be

35
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,130
continuing

36
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:03,430
so yeah to start off with a mention we
want to move sort of pass this whole at

37
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,459
moniker and really want to do that is to
sort of reduce our scarce set of

38
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,890
research labs covers a lot you know the
person place thing everything about the

39
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,399
attack it's an advanced persistent
threat that's kind of generic so you

40
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,650
want to try and reduce it a little bit
get some ground to cover and come to a

41
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,860
ground where I can say all right well I
understand this about this subject and I

42
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,040
can tell you about it so what we decide
to do with that is clean the term mill

43
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,220
where I am talking about 10 where
military now we're right the intent is

44
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,519
not to create a consistent easy use
attribution to all right that's not our

45
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,010
game rather we're trying to look at the
architectural and behavioral

46
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,179
characteristics of code to distinguish
between different types of authors not

47
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,260
necessarily too tight for particular
offer or not sure is less about the

48
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,739
direction interaction with the code

49
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:59,480
the product for us to try and come up
with a different set of characteristics

50
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,690
allows the policy community right
language they understand you began to

51
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,200
rain the problem right in a way that's
not just their his mouth were out there

52
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,109
and it's this big giant massive stuff
we're trying to sit somewhere in between

53
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,780
all malware is code and hey look at this
really great in-depth analysis of a

54
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,399
particular seemed so what we did in
order to were trying to do in order to

55
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,890
do that is to come up with a
classification framework with this talk

56
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,710
presents is basically a rudimentary set
of characteristics that we develop sort

57
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,729
of an alpha differentiate between these
two sets of samples the mass index

58
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:41,470
delicious software sophistication and X
Ray said he wanted to reduce it

59
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,110
and care more about how it's made what
it's made of the individual parts of it

60
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,140
look at them our dissected in sort of
these modules and try to come up with

61
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,080
classification for if you see these
things present you know it looks like

62
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,280
malware or it looks like mill where it
smells like Miller it's probably me so

63
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,250
that's what our index does not this
super concise if you see this thing with

64
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,920
the score at the CVSS it's gonna be
malware but something like alright well

65
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,770
now we have set set of literature that
we can say all right well since it

66
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,630
matches bees classification standards
it's probably going to land in this

67
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,120
ballpark but we're not concerned about
right now is target says we think it's

68
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,550
too easy to spoon were also not
concerned with trying to tie the coach

69
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,720
who particular states right it's likely
that the cultures in the operating

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,780
environment of a group called for
musicians working within russia and

71
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,849
China have different objectives are
gonna have different operational

72
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,770
considerations result of that we can't
speak to that yet though

73
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,200
sample size isn't big enough so we're
looking at right now is just across all

74
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,159
states sample these high-end sort of
groups that were trying to capture

75
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,380
capabilities of their architecture and
behavior really important note at the

76
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:56,190
top one we're not describing battlefield
capabilities for this group when you

77
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,760
talk about mill where you end up getting
into this mix discussion between stuff

78
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,669
that's been used at the strategic level
and instead this potentially being

79
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,700
deployed on the battlefield not getting
into the battlefield side

80
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,560
its second novel States bilko the same
not any group of groups and

81
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,790
organisations in the same way we're
trying to capture the high-end set of

82
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:22,560
capabilities that will see coming out of
states like Russia China aus and Israel

83
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,400
this is a way to try and clustering
those capabilities it's an it's an

84
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,179
analytic short and not try to draw a
really aggressive line in the sand it

85
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,150
said yes

86
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,950
over here operating in one environment
over here is radically different that's

87
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:42,640
not the intent here so even if it's a
quantifiable metrics to try and come up

88
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,240
with a way to differentiate state and
non-state code not quantifiable yet

89
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,160
rights now CBS system there's a drawback
CSS that we get into it was actually

90
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,570
kind of a pain in the butt to work with
but that's a problem talk the other

91
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,920
objective here is that this is a tool
for policymakers something isn't

92
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,830
eligible to connect to another LA on the
hill some of the executive branch trying

93
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,700
to craft an area for them so that they
understand more about this problem area

94
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,370
and it doesn't become a reduced 20 pages
personal white paper we're trying to get

95
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,190
a language of semantic framework I
understand the sort of products that

96
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,390
exists in this space and differentiation
that comes from those products look

97
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,050
different or operate differently

98
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,669
we're trying to create a bit of a
Rubicon rosetta stone of sorts we get

99
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:35,560
some generalized language that means
that they re do you like here is the

100
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,030
thing that I found and ok I get that
without having to read through these

101
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:47,989
massive white papers that they might not
understand too well so yeah that's kind

102
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,710
of what we're trying to do with this so
the criterion of you start looking at

103
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:58,448
within our samples was propagation
methods how did it get to the target and

104
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:02,300
once it infected the targets network
where did it go how did it internally

105
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,229
propagate where an independent to next
we looked at actually severity of an

106
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:11,330
obvious indicator of its using this
o'day that no one seen before

107
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,810
odds are it's probably not serious and
if it's using black hole it's probably

108
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,580
not and then lastly want to look at
Baylor characteristics this kind of

109
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,409
matches with the internal propagation a
trick that we picked because the payload

110
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:30,789
however something more specific like
Stuxnet yeah it's going to spread

111
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:33,679
everywhere but if I can infect
everywhere it's looking for this one

112
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,049
specific target at this one specific
place that it will be one specific thing

113
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:42,880
and then just died on that we define
propagation along two metrics scale and

114
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,420
specificity scale it's trying to capture
the broadest set of targets that this

115
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,150
method employed in fact if you set up a
a compromise cite a single

116
00:08:52,150 --> 00:09:04,270
the GAO site right that was used to
target his mother USDA was last year the

117
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,480
scale for this site are all potential
users all the visitors to that site

118
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,290
scale for USB stick substantially
smaller gotta find the right

119
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,520
organization even parking lot I don't
get it on some of these machines

120
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,100
specificity captured within that
potential target pool the limiting

121
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,420
factors that you built into the code in
order to target a particular user or

122
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,449
particular network talk about Stuxnet
Stuxnet had a series of checks built

123
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,950
into it in order to establish what the
operating system was the configuration

124
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,870
files the presence of certain other
pieces of software simply Asia Minor

125
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,550
action stuff from Siemens to understand
what platform it was on and to execute

126
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,630
accordingly so scale half of the total
possible target for specificity and how

127
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,080
you limit within that one of the things
that we make in the piece is between

128
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,750
fishing spear fishing fishing is the
sort of broad mass little specificity

129
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,460
propagation tool here fishing is a big
scale but the more detail you put into a

130
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,700
particular individual guy who lives next
to him and told her he knows with all

131
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,870
the time limits the specificity of the
propagation

132
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,880
so again we want to try and it's cracked
up to a higher level make it as generic

133
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,510
as possible we didn't want to say all
right what you see this exact signature

134
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,580
it's probably going to be nowhere
because policymakers don't care about

135
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,610
signatures they care about evidence so
when trying to develop this we wanted to

136
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,500
make that evidence is highly possible so
going through stuff we did a lot of re

137
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,950
re work on our samples but we also match
that with reading a lot of white papers

138
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,480
of technical documents attacking this
problem from both angles as a little bit

139
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,180
hairy because we had to do the same
thing twice more last but by doing that

140
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,319
we came to pretty good

141
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,700
grounds and another note about this is
it does lend towards and some response

142
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,390
like you need while using this metric to
have an idea of what did it do

143
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,860
where did it go like this is host attack
cossacks played host oh my god we've

144
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,130
been so it relies on some evidence to
back up

145
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,820
translations are you know secret service
comes knocking on your door you been

146
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,830
compromised

147
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,700
alright well was it from north korea or
a guy in Russia in his moms basement

148
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,960
rights against international problems
interdisciplinary issue I was looking

149
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,510
for something I can say this makes a
difference these groups are different

150
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,000
based on this thing I don't care what
the thing is i can tell you that their

151
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,070
segment in some way based on a
documentation I can then start to draw

152
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,490
implications of the russians engaging
with these international organizations

153
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,700
but not these other ones we see that
there are reports in Tennessee looking

154
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,590
to buy or having interest in certain
companies but not others trying to draw

155
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,620
transform the underlying distinction
rather than being injured in the

156
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,640
distinction itself was an initial intent
of interesting roadblock because people

157
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,910
interested in underlying characteristics
and differentiation was really hard

158
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,760
they're really not confirm all
information security in general but

159
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,740
that's another problem altogether

160
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,360
us getting together was trying to say
what methods matter to the question and

161
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,220
working on a question was prime hardest
initial part what we actually trying to

162
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,680
do it became obvious pretty quickly
given the scale the resources we have

163
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,640
available to us in our samples we can
get into re time there could put into

164
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,699
the project that we were going to be
able to come up with something that was

165
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:26,120
a slam dunk set of tools that you could
put into an automated program right and

166
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,160
turn around and say up this is always
know where we're still agree manual

167
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,610
process will really qualitative as one
of those who want to expand upon that

168
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,670
was our first cut it trying to focus on
this question how we differentiate

169
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,750
between state and non-state code given
that what implications are there are

170
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,740
differentiated behavior statement

171
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:54,530
trace point we don't have a lot of time
I was 11 are in all this stuff I am a

172
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,209
full time soon as well and work a job so
not a lot of time to dedicate to this

173
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,910
bug or something cool site for me as
well so yeah every jury process to load

174
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,730
it up tonight I see what it's doing this
analyzer see how it works

175
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,770
capture packets all that stuff but again
the other part of it was attacking him

176
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,390
from the upper level angle and saying
alright well we've got a bunch of these

177
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,210
papers that's come out as we pick some
known samples that had been written on

178
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,650
it had been published and we wanted to
work from the bottom up in the top down

179
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,990
the middle

180
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,970
took a lot of time getting really
in-depth technical documents has you

181
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,160
know alright I'm not an actual like
malicious user I wanna read this

182
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,680
continuing research and all marcia but
that there thank you for the samples it

183
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,459
was fun to get a hang on that not a lot
of monetary resource so it was picking

184
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:45,210
you see if we can get a process there's
nothing super groundbreaking but that's

185
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:52,830
not why were here I'd is good at what it
does it keep it again

186
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,350
high-level high-level want to bring all
of this low level stuff we try to keep

187
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,880
the data collection is open source as
possible so that anyone could use this

188
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,290
it was very easy to get your hands on
what we did relatively speaking and if

189
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,610
you just got the papers using a free
market we came up with some other

190
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,820
samples that you might want to do
research on you could work strictly from

191
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,160
top to bottom and say all right why rent
this in newspapers and I can see this

192
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,709
behavior in these papers even though it
might already landlords number I can

193
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:28,130
verify that I can understand that myself
and again we want to make it so no one

194
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,200
needed to know assembly to actually use
this

195
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,840
so finding a pretty straight forward and
make a lot of sense you probably aren't

196
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,970
you understand that when propagating to
the target malware like Zeus wants to

197
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,920
infect everyone just wants to get all of
your banking credit so we were looking

198
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,680
at a very sort of very broad propagation
method when it was trying to infect

199
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,339
users it was just using XSS really broad
spear phishing campaign but had little

200
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:03,060
to no personalization your average on
Nigerian king scheme and the spirit of

201
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,420
the best way that we saw those again
they were like blackhole exploit kit

202
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,160
they were these things that have been
documented I'm going into your grandma's

203
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:20,079
unpatched PC from 1985 so loud that it
had about as the payload it wanted to

204
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,300
sit there

205
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:29,099
nationals and internal and once again it
just tried to hosts and in fact I didn't

206
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,250
care what they were and it doesn't
really care you know is this an admin

207
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:42,200
boxer is this your grandma's computer
and just wants to get out so we saw

208
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:48,870
propagation a target was very very very
very targeted very specific when it was

209
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,300
a spear phishing campaign it was
targeting one maybe two people and it

210
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,930
was just looking to get in there and
done a lot of previous research done a

211
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,650
lot of messy and they knew who they were
dropping any emails and if that wasn't

212
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,050
the case and they're using an actual
date against the system they knew the

213
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,560
system before they even start attacking
it unlike Zeus which just everywhere

214
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,890
these samples in specific places and
don't really wanna be detected for

215
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,449
obvious reasons at least one initially
getting they might want to check it

216
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:23,420
later but that's different story so many
things they got very specific but all

217
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,569
set that came with these pieces of
nowhere

218
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,360
we're very very targeted actual tools
that came with it was specifically for

219
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,520
its motivation it was trying to get
specific docs like ants and where it

220
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,260
would

221
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,660
start gathering dachshund ex-military
nothing else it might spread to a couple

222
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,180
of other targets and wanted to but that
was about it if it was looking to cause

223
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:51,060
mass chaos will start propagating sort
of like Miller does but again

224
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,869
everywhere with the sole intention of
shutting things down not necessarily

225
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:01,880
gathering credentials for money so
there's some insight from this right one

226
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,480
of the things that became interesting
and looking at this kind of

227
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,420
differentiation how much effort has gone
into the prior reconnaissance work in

228
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:12,060
terms of propagation was you can follow
an assumption that how many how much

229
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:18,780
time and how much resources you devote
to look around about when you're looking

230
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,690
at the state level and you're talking
about moving between different types of

231
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:26,680
networks are trying to practice securely
hard target the corresponding resource

232
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,570
investment to do that goes up the thing
that we're trying to figure out from

233
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,460
this right so distracted driving those
first implications is if you are looking

234
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,020
at a piece of code that is going to
function largely autonomously in a set

235
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:44,460
of complex networks with non commercial
software which is to say not in common

236
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,870
you stop thinking about something like
Stuxnet will do the amount of

237
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,590
engineering effort associated with
getting the details right now we're

238
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,730
looking at again for me is vision for
the size of the group that's involved

239
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,090
with that their commitment to a
particular target amount of monetary

240
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,199
resources in human capital that they're
gonna put into setting this tool in

241
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,220
motion and refining it as they go it's
possible that as a result of that

242
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,020
process he would start to see exactly
what you'd expect in any other complex

243
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:19,590
industrial process specialization
economies of scale so I have to do this

244
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:24,409
sort of propagation difficult networks
on a regular basis am I gonna attack

245
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:29,170
every problem has its own specific
boutique issue or am I gonna start to

246
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:33,100
build specialty in my group potentially
take a platform I can replicate across

247
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,480
different targets potentially take a set
of capabilities I can stick on a target

248
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,370
just to me gain and maintain access for
whatever I want to do in the future I do

249
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,929
I start sticking myself a lot of boxes

250
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,700
just in case I might want to come back
or something later this is the sort of

251
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,300
behavior we're seeing with lack energy
writes a lot of you guys have read this

252
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,899
and report on the December 23rd like
energy has been found and bunched up

253
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,690
here in the states goes to the house and
focused on his work as a reconnaissance

254
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:07,650
platforms and as a way to maintain
access the analysis Robert Lee who's the

255
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,180
dragon security guys working for census
right upset like energy was the way it

256
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,150
was the point of access into this power
plant it did not allow did not

257
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,540
facilitate a payload that was at
self-destructive really just give

258
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:25,320
somebody a chance to come in at
returning stuff off manually from the

259
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,470
moment the implication here is building
tools to gain and maintain access to

260
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,870
tons of different systems now using the
three-letter three little words here

261
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,560
that's a massive industrial average
special if you're doing across multiple

262
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,510
states and organizations

263
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,170
coming back we can differentiate the
operating characteristics between

264
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,990
diagnostic code potentially based on the
propagation technique and it has an

265
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,540
implication in terms of the organization
that has built up behind it

266
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,800
little signs of problems is we deal
badly with supplicant we don't deal well

267
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,820
when we don't have you don't have to get
everybody but it's a problem for us

268
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,669
because we don't always care so you're
really crazy ass that's come out of

269
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,750
science people saying we don't take a
best guess right we're trying to solve

270
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,730
that problem by tying what we're what
we're observing little were observing

271
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,550
particular applications rather just
taking wild guesses about Tennessee's

272
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:28,430
doing what 8200 doing right try to
actually make his back while I make our

273
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,290
best guess better

274
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:40,050
summary of everything we found three lbs
targeted Mallory isn't and within that

275
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:44,530
targeting again as he said looking to
spread its not looking a spreading debt

276
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:51,280
it's just probably gonna be sitting
there so where are you from step one

277
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,940
cares about the target particular later
we don't see the wide-scale highly

278
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:00,790
nonspecific propagation mechanisms
scattershot it's looking for information

279
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,740
about the network itself is a priority
placed on internal identification Active

280
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,440
Directory credentials particular user
credentials that have high value within

281
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,310
the structure of that network in order
to move around in a way that's not going

282
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:16,990
to internal I guess systems that's not
going to potentially give its location

283
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:22,740
away so not just on a basic user
actually trying to get to a sysadmin and

284
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,420
move around more seamlessly important
part is the stuff for espionage it wants

285
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,010
to gather information it doesn't want
your money

286
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,750
the guys running this probably have a
lot of money anyways so it's going to

287
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,390
look their tennis it's gonna listen it
might not do a whole lot first couple

288
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,110
months at a time maybe even a year

289
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:44,689
export trade terabytes of data and ergo
your state secrets right looking for

290
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,750
high-value targets then again the terror
notions a little bit strange but we're

291
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,960
talking about the majority these
payloads are built for espionage and so

292
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,970
on some form of espionage reconnaissance

293
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,980
Stuxnet was destructive other examples
of that there's not a ton of them in

294
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,860
this is not trying to bracket this just
in to stop its gonna break thing we also

295
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,520
care about this and like other known
terrorist

296
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,639
becoming the big thing that's probably
enough to worry about in the near future

297
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,020
and several worker actually becomes
really hardcore alright well we got our

298
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,260
power grid as IOC inaccessible to your
neighbor's dog and that morning crash is

299
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,539
not a fun time

300
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:32,759
ok so why do this well we actually only
are we did initially was to look at cars

301
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:37,169
and to the right and the state samples
were staying warm in the cold missoni

302
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:40,989
attacks we went back after that and
looked at white paper in technical

303
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:45,710
analysis for Red October 4 Stuxnet you
could soon to point out her life and on

304
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:52,989
the non stateside looked at homies a
better one or two more in there also

305
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:59,849
will have on everything from science
perspective I'm saying maybe Eric really

306
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:03,158
likes particular hooks and just focused
on him when he's doing this stuff and we

307
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,239
totally miss another something to come
by one of the big efforts I think for us

308
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:10,529
and moving forward the process is trying
to automate this sorry pipeline as much

309
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:15,830
as possible to work that out is it don't
matter genomics we're trying to create

310
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:19,849
two separate classifications and fit
this whole mess assembles into one of

311
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:23,529
those and then maybe even within those
classifications alright well we've got

312
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:26,769
something for espionage and something
for terror within mill where are their

313
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:31,639
classify that stuff and we need an
actual good rigorous platform to do this

314
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:35,498
for these thousands of samples men were
doing this by hand

315
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:42,320
4,000 samples pretty garbage so that's
will get back to ya ya so it was

316
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,149
difficult in a car in life

317
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:49,649
state offered samples not only should be
shopping crazy right I don't work for

318
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:56,289
DHS so that's a problem for me even if I
did garbage so it's early after research

319
00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:02,470
we had limited resources limited time
but something came up with the big thing

320
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,019
for us is building out in next week and
certified by Chris Gayle will

321
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:09,599
infrastructure associated with this writ
differentiations a framework that we

322
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,289
hope will expand over time it's not a
single point universe right so why even

323
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:18,759
do this policy perspective how you were
trying to blend different types of

324
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:24,059
research that was a really interesting
process part of the excitement on the

325
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:29,599
part of this came out of a field and
it's a proposal and Science Foundation

326
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,879
Day Fund different sort of files of
research depending on what discipline

327
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:35,330
you're in there also have the security

328
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,909
computing program is intended to pull
together social science and technical

329
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,810
people problem one and a step is super
risk-averse don't want to give you money

330
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,830
until you basically demonstrated that
you've done a project which point

331
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,929
becomes like a chicken and egg issue
second thing is they are it's a cautious

332
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:57,720
about work that uses novel methodologies
this is not a political science

333
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,800
why are you looking at coach Ray you are
not a computer scientists are you

334
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,210
talking about politics are you are not a
political scientist so we had some

335
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,020
issues convincing people that will
distribute done and would be valuable to

336
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:12,129
the respective disciplines right value
to the discipline is a big roadblock for

337
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,930
the academy and we talk about it all the
time of her introduced prior work how

338
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,840
are you reward somebody's in one
discipline publishing in another great

339
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,209
example this which I found out during
this process that on about journals are

340
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,900
publications go into journals

341
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,900
their ranks are hard to get into the
publication timeline isn't singing along

342
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,130
at like eighteen months the respect
accorded publications is based on the

343
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:40,310
tyranny of the journal Science in
finding out more about conference

344
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,620
publications in Proceedings so I could
something useless right it's

345
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,409
ridiculously low acceptance rate it's
great to see people like you presented

346
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:54,780
your paper I don't think so again trying
to come back and justified and I this

347
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,990
research was difficult and importance
and doing a separate search is it needs

348
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,770
to be done

349
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:04,080
never panels in talks yesterday and
Friday about hey we need political

350
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,250
science and computer science to work
together this is an example of one way

351
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,150
that it's possible very very small
example given but one that needs to be

352
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:16,210
done this question of how do I say this
is a daughter that's something that

353
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,740
needs to be answered and understood by
the policy I snaking make the right

354
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,940
policies to try and figure these things
out like we say after year nafta secret

355
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,730
conspiracy we need them to understand
that they seek oh that looks karen

356
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,740
hasn't terrifying you why they think oh
god we need to block all of that that's

357
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,100
not what we want this was a first
prototype and being able to demonstrate

358
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,120
that this morning announced as possible
and you can actually draw some useful

359
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,908
applications out of disciplines on
differentiating samples and techniques

360
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:48,460
a lack of high-level language and has
been a lot of discussion about the last

361
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,559
six to 12 months certainly in the last
few pounds yesterday are the problems

362
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,109
associated with a conversation with that
there's a misunderstanding on the part

363
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:59,460
of the policy community about what these
tools actually do I dare not able to

364
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,789
reliably differentiate between the hotel
stuff and the stuff that's it you're

365
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:09,139
going to have a problem with that might
be intentional and I tell part what

366
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:11,639
we're trying to do is come up with a
better framework them to understand and

367
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:12,689
appreciate this though

368
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:19,619
mention a lot modification of standard
execution path of the program

369
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:30,009
anybody use plugins for Firefox update
code at all so this is an issue right

370
00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:34,019
community to the policy community
doesn't understand unhappiness early to

371
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,629
granular level we're talking about but
he comes up with crap definitions like

372
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:42,580
this as a result so is there a better
framework a better language then some

373
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,960
thirty two-year-old science graduate who
had never seen a piece of code in his

374
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,779
life trying to Lake into it

375
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:51,979
a definition this is a way to try to
move date for this isn't a product for

376
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:52,399
it

377
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,678
the end result in an assault that
problem and try to build a community of

378
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,799
scholarship the table working this
interdisciplinary fashion hopefully

379
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,349
we'll get it down at half price what
does it all mean we talked a lot about

380
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:08,599
policy implications of these out the
premises that statement during starting

381
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:12,928
to do this more and more applications
that first is that it's not gonna be a

382
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:15,710
bespoke process for them they're going
to industrialize the process because

383
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,299
it's what you do anytime you're
confronted with a repeated set of

384
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:23,960
complex problems just like military
military industrial complex in trying to

385
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,039
do this with my right and I are starting
to see that especially in the contractor

386
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,529
community some of you know more about
that than we do for sure if you're

387
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:34,649
interested in talking with love to hear
from you so some implications first

388
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:40,789
States of Tara Carolina and there's a
sort of ongoing trend horrified sorry

389
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:43,899
marketing sort of inside the gets pushed
out by InfoSec manners when they find

390
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:46,178
something cool they take it apart and
cults in the world

391
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:51,700
sexy name hello stuff it does with some
of the ninety-four to react to that the

392
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,309
state's less unless it doesn't seem to
impact their overall

393
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:59,210
all mission set in their willingness to
operate in particular targets they may

394
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:04,009
be attack near infect another way in
some cases things done with all that's

395
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:08,269
that's problematic that's a potential to
emphasise community to combat these

396
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:10,299
sorts of threats doesn't seem to be
working

397
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:14,539
second states are breaking trust in
infrastructure more regularly the

398
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:18,929
non-state actor goes back to that
resource AAdvantage number of the number

399
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:23,159
of codes sign state symbols are
substantially higher than our Sun Devils

400
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,600
substantially higher than non-state
groups as an implication for that

401
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,360
signing process as a chain of trust it's
awesome to see a system in CH become

402
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,990
compromised on a regular basis by
certain he prophesies it's an issue for

403
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:41,619
the rest of the community because we
stop trusting that infrastructure is not

404
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:45,059
that this hasn't been done before right
shoes compromise instead only internal

405
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:48,970
Certificate Signing infrastructure in
order to get past IKEA systems that's

406
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,639
happened before but it's more common
mistakes in at a more regular issue

407
00:29:52,639 --> 00:30:00,369
right the day we're able to generate and
use the system

408
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:05,249
sexy propagation of that stuff becomes
more common we're gonna stop trusting

409
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:09,070
vendors and processes in the same way
that has announced during application

410
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:15,970
has a policy implication third this
stuff will proliferate we're not saying

411
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,799
that all know where is the sexiest most
advanced stuff out there but we think

412
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:23,889
generally that the code embedded in
these platforms involves more novel

413
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,860
techniques and compromise methodologies
in the stuff you see from non-state

414
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:31,299
groups that's problematic to get a
little while all this industrial process

415
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:34,529
were talking about working at scale and
spending lots of money trying to come up

416
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:38,539
with new ways to get to maintain access
to these systems are trickling down it

417
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:41,649
announced a community means that they
are funding the same research

418
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:45,330
development tickets used against banks
and gets used against individuals the

419
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:50,559
TrueType explains in Dookudu right back
on level par survivability was found

420
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,350
less than a year later in the black kid
who exploit it right

421
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,590
a month after its you need six months
after that was like in half a dozen kids

422
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,629
doing some really good research on this
trickle-down problem

423
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:03,399
research issue

424
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:07,168
the community is certainly in a
wonderful science I'm sorry sight we

425
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:10,940
don't understand how to categorize this
reuptake process very well we don't have

426
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,429
a good set of metrics for how
complicated something would be taken

427
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:19,809
Rican by so policymaker gets up and says
whoa Stuxnet we put out there and

428
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:24,719
everybody's gonna grab and start blowing
things up like this stuff is really

429
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:28,359
carefully designed to the Siemens PLC
down in the config files and it's

430
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:32,059
looking at this carefully engineered
platform trying to create a very

431
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:36,239
specific set of facts so yeah you're
gonna politics plays out in use at your

432
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:40,460
own code the payload is not just a
drag-and-drop problem and understanding

433
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,809
a differentiation is important for the
policy people to it is doing sort of a

434
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:48,158
long chain of understanding this
differentiation alright well we have a

435
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,879
specific example of Stuxnet what happens
when you drag it over long-term you got

436
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:56,619
multiple samples of Miller coming out we
see this differentiation happening we're

437
00:31:56,619 --> 00:32:01,279
sorta trickles down over a long-term
multiple years maybe how do we see that

438
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,789
impacting them our markets and we see
that impacting the code that goes out

439
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:09,019
how do we see that impacting yes we can
go out if you don't have the sort of

440
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:12,960
long-term quantifiable evidence to say
all right well it might not necessarily

441
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,820
be that bad wow this is garbage please
stop the pasta makers man I really care

442
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:23,928
too much drinking at a time when I know
it's actually true right so that you're

443
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:28,139
doing this more regularly to spending
more money on it if that scales creates

444
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:31,459
a potential problem where it's in their
interest again to try to create cost

445
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,139
effective means of gaining access to
systems that might mean compromising

446
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:39,589
existing operating systems major
software distros that might mean as

447
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:43,809
we've seen potentially introducing
systemic vulnerabilities in a commonly

448
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:49,219
used poppers like I don't know a VPN
that's an issue for us as a community

449
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:52,690
understanding how these standards
promulgated and potentially compromised

450
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,759
realizing that these are areas of
interest are major state organizations

451
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:59,769
where we have a lot of insight to the
USA but other states are definitely

452
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,489
doing it without question and
potentially greater scale to

453
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:06,999
understanding how consistent that
differentiation is allowed to start up a

454
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:12,150
picture of what actually happened how
common is the state cute

455
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:17,450
and last man it's really hard to rest
states are seamlessly right Department

456
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,160
of Justice year and a half ago indicted
five members of the Chinese People's

457
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,290
Liberation Army they were connected to
Sony's espionage platforms that came out

458
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:32,320
was like to work right marcia got call
of duty in the restroom break you can

459
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,750
arrest these guys it's difficult it
hinges on a really simple problem the

460
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,430
state assume is legitimate legal actor

461
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:43,490
lips the higher to write will one day
we're going after non-state groups who

462
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,600
are who are a legitimate tracking them
down and getting exposed to sunlight a

463
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,860
problem for them and they want to be
secret hiding now we're talking about

464
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,709
the very institutions that give us the
legal basis to do this we got the

465
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:59,000
sovereignty problem absolutely right
when Microsoft account the Rustock

466
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,890
botnet they had to do it in conjunction
with the DOJ because we're grateful

467
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,720
concerns on their part about what their
liability would be on the part of taking

468
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,570
the step down and grabbing potential
legitimate users they had a lot of

469
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:14,730
Commerce now you know you have a debate
about whether or not there was

470
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:20,340
legitimate actin and would essentially
let me know that they worked with the

471
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,120
State of the State game in the legal
authority in the cover to do this they

472
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,980
worked out what they thought was the
best man for the state's legitimate

473
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,780
after here now the right code now while
they're doing its scale to how we can

474
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,690
pass this as a threat

475
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:41,450
have to change the sort of thinking
about these groups and heard the term

476
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:47,500
framework lately been discussed it came
up to 10 times how do we talk to

477
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,949
congress people to NSC staff and
communicate this distinction and more

478
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:56,129
importantly use this is the basis to
communicate the simple patients today

479
00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:01,390
this is a rudimentary attempt to try to
come up with the systematic framework to

480
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,810
describe the architecture behavior code

481
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:08,150
differential between state and non-state
actors at the intent is a big box were

482
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:12,910
trying to fill with a trading indicators
is gonna change but part of that process

483
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:17,500
is coming up with the language right
this notion of a propagation method and

484
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,890
exploit an appeal of a sort of a
framework check capture

485
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,839
malicious software it's a really
rudimentary model a mental all models

486
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:28,210
are bad but summer useful it's an
attempt to try to capture those

487
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,640
characteristics in a way that doesn't
require us to grow coded somebody who's

488
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,710
not be able to understand it products
right crafting language in trying to

489
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:41,430
develop analytical tools for the
community around those issue so we talk

490
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:50,190
a little bit about samples much data
insights such what we want to do with

491
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,140
this is to expand dramatically

492
00:35:53,140 --> 00:36:00,190
talk about being a box of 14 samples not
enough not enough right and and not sure

493
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,430
I'll genetics

494
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:09,549
sort of consistent tractable re work
over a family of code trace changes and

495
00:36:09,549 --> 00:36:15,299
features and capabilities overtime is
prospering in the next step by step we

496
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:20,950
want to be able to do two things the
first is change feature change Race

497
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,149
Track Changes income families over time

498
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:29,500
lucien of code not a novel issue when I
started it was states take it out of

499
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,029
this well look I found something really
cool its single isolated instance start

500
00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:38,559
to look over time at trends and behavior
and friends and future choices the

501
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,359
second is if we can do that we want to
start to trace diffusion of code between

502
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:51,009
family so when used right it turned into
an was taken different parts into a

503
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:54,660
number of different samples are
purpose-built a lot of it right on the

504
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,230
source code we want to see if those

505
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,340
and to what extent between state and
non-state sample two reasons that's

506
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,320
interesting first let me talk about
Dooku fattest state in doing a bunch of

507
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,300
really cool R&D

508
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,030
trickling down in nineteen actors
actresses sort of low-cost bonanza for

509
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:15,290
them and the second is it might be in
this is a policy implications might be

510
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:20,130
that states are intentionally giving
this relationship between some of the

511
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:24,869
criminal groups operate in Ukraine and
the turtle platform is open to question

512
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:27,700
there's a researcher at harvard who
believes that the russians are using

513
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:32,460
these groups as outsourced research and
development organizations where they

514
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,109
essentially get in exchange for legal
protection for their lives in actor

515
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:41,150
person and any new R&D news before doing
right and it can be changed to six

516
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,880
months not sure yet

517
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,310
part of the problem is a date issue we
haven't seen as samples in a long enough

518
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,390
track right collected somewhere we can
trace those features over time

519
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,640
be able to establish those relationships
an important part of this is an analysis

520
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,900
of the samples over time that's gonna be
pretty garden needs to be an actual

521
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,840
rigorous framework used to say all right
we got this ten thousand samples of this

522
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,880
one family but see twenty samples came
out what changed and trying to

523
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,880
marginalize it struck a code does this
code of this country code us this we've

524
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,230
got the stuff coming in from Miller
samples that we've got some major change

525
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,960
in this junk food safety explains
because you know that's what it does

526
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,710
all right well we see over this span of
time the actual government nor samples

527
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,990
coming in making this as a low-cost
bonanza

528
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,379
so the other implication for this and
the other issue is

529
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,619
because we're promised on restricting
activity and non-state actors the

530
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,660
existing institutional tool to me about
their the Wassenaar a great example

531
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,868
those are tools designed to solve
problems in the traditional realm lost

532
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:53,029
our originally developed to restrict the
sale of dual use items like machine

533
00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:56,609
tools advanced metallurgy components
right met people from building a nuclear

534
00:38:56,609 --> 00:39:02,569
weapon a problem with that is its most
famous on the activities are not secured

535
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:07,049
by commercial it's difficult to apply
something like Wassenaar even with its

536
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:11,299
craft language to a state has no
enforcement mechanism there's no

537
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:15,589
verification mechanism is entirely
voluntary framework so we get up and say

538
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:20,089
yes states are using code in such a way
to serve to proliferate capabilities to

539
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:24,490
non-state proves that creates a more
systemic and security organizations

540
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,919
what's the problem there and we build an
impaired patients to go to a policy

541
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,950
makers say your issue is that you need
to restrain your own behavior you need

542
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:38,759
to restrain behavior her neighbor but we
can't do that is not state actors like

543
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:48,250
process to get together and find
consensus ok so we're trying to come up

544
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,500
with a new way to sleep in a framework
to begin that language in Iraq and the

545
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,539
diplomat and a piece of this is my
family's directors and certain model

546
00:39:56,539 --> 00:40:00,809
their decision-making talk about the
market and it's a it's a little bit of a

547
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:06,260
framework we put on these interactions
between people like preval

548
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:11,730
and brokers and parts of this community
but our market like behaviour

549
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,530
specialization that takes place

550
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:19,250
focus in particular problems and pricing
mechanisms their reputation mechanisms

551
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:24,670
market like features of these
interactions with its differentiate the

552
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:30,350
decision making of a low and criminal
group of high-end organization of a

553
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:35,089
state are they buying differently in a
choose to build around to try to grab

554
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,900
from somebody else to buy something
office market with decision-making

555
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,790
process look like so at the end

556
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:49,390
shutout in his friend we are working to
try to expand as for private funders

557
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,870
academic institutions with really want
to see this home at the university and

558
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:56,880
build it out as not just a research
program but to start to talk about work

559
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,170
on the culture within the social
sciences a few signs of you sort of

560
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:00,860
stuff right

561
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,170
the white community right the
information economics guys and the hard

562
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,680
core I would describe right security
engineering groups there's not enough

563
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,509
communication is good work being done on
both sides were trying to put in

564
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:17,110
conversation with each other so if you
have time if you have access to samples

565
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,210
and data if you have tools that you
think would be interesting for us to use

566
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:26,300
of highly credit card information for
parents to talk to you we are we are

567
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,030
open and willing to engage with want to
hear from the community both in terms of

568
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,470
what works and what doesn't this
framework with stuff is going to be do

569
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,720
we know this is going to retire right
this box is gonna ship the United States

570
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,569
take Odom lucien problem is gonna be a
horse race downlight something's got to

571
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:44,370
get updated every six months and I know
what they don't have access to the tools

572
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:50,370
we can go now to do that consistently
will make this possible overtime on a

573
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:54,690
beta so if you have questions or
comments

574
00:41:54,690 --> 00:42:24,059
hang out so questions

575
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:47,319
so related to state institutions around
the principles we don't have they get

576
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:51,910
into space but taking that idea right
would be another thought here that's

577
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:58,670
that's our conversation when you have
questions please give up to it but if

578
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:10,180
not you see

579
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:20,940
long

580
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:26,220
so obviously attribution is hard her
alot of groups that kind of falling the

581
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:34,129
middle hitter you have like Sony hack
we're definitely not us a quasi you know

582
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:40,859
sponsored groups have non-state actors
who have cyber armies that don't really

583
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:48,930
have the same capabilities of a doctor
and then you have you know you have a

584
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:52,520
guy who worked on Turtle over five years
but his spare time he does crime where

585
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:59,440
you can't unlearn that source code so it
seems like a really difficult to find a

586
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,420
way to signature that kind of stuff so
how's your model kind of a challenge for

587
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:11,599
those cases yes the model we didn't
really focus on attribution we didn't

588
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,839
want to say this sample is specifically
from this dude in russia was just a very

589
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:21,420
basic interest sample of what is now or
what is nowhere but continuing on that

590
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,460
something that we definitely would like
to tackle but we can't necessarily say

591
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,230
all right well we see the same patterns
in the source code

592
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:31,359
these different samples to get better
and again

593
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,319
high-level more rigorous understand we
need to hide these sort of diffusion

594
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:43,590
times with actual real-world of the
transmitted gave her an individual if

595
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,080
you're talking about is a fingerprinting
problem and that's only part of the

596
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,340
existing set an attribution tool but the
discussions we've been having with

597
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:52,970
individuals in this community that
that's easier to spook than we'd like to

598
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:59,819
talk about words times you guys were
compiling languages right it's not it's

599
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,260
not as useful so the answer is it's
going to be hard to overcome that right

600
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,720
there are ways to be a case of guys who
are right and a jumper contractor

601
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,819
somewhere in the coming up on stuff
maybe an intern for fire I don't know

602
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:16,120
right thats indebted to deal with but
the bigger problem isn't anything we're

603
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,970
trying to capture is by looking at the
architecture of the platform as a whole

604
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:23,509
rather than need stylistic fragments in
particular pieces of it we think we can

605
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:27,010
account for that they can speak to
resource decisions operational

606
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:33,329
considerations less than your own
personal

607
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:38,809
question your hands will hang everything
is kicking around hoping to jump-start

608
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:43,670
your brain the time that again you
really would love to talk to you guys

609
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:47,789
about tools and data is something where
there's an opportunity to really pull

610
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:51,150
together a group working on this sort of
stuff and it's not just gonna come out

611
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:56,499
of my department's not just his party so
engaging guy thanks much for coming this

612
00:45:56,499 --> 00:45:56,749
morning
