1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
games and as I stories of those thoughts
several weeks there are some new year's

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,428
results read those using the menus
that's why he talks about it as a given

3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:21,570
in to YouTube alright so the good news
is that there's no need to panic you

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,019
already know that breaks are it's a
money-raising

5
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,060
what may be a nice out today that we
hardly know how to maintain a system of

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,079
like danger beats nine cubans obviously
and we want to do you want to break our

7
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:42,860
assay was like a dozen beats 1024 2048
bits but reduces when it not thousand

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:50,070
cubits when it means it's not what we
believe the day now the question is is

9
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,460
it a million times harder to make a
medias million copies in self regulatory

10
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:01,600
just a hundred times under different
views people united will come in 10

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,200
years I don't know but maybe we need
what we need is a mountain project and

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,619
could be a much wiser and much cuter to
investors money if this isn't a

13
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:17,090
candidate to undo it could be much
better today to four days is that as we

14
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:25,500
know it will not work has been skeptical
about you know disruptive changes

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,570
inserting 9-10 was saying you know you
know about this stuff he was saying that

16
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,059
was skeptical about the ability to
create the nation bombed-out could be

17
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,390
drawn by air and obviously he was wrong
so many people are wrong when it will

18
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:49,560
not be built but the difference is that
we know that it was possible to be there

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,450
how to make bombs and not reassured that
you can be adequate computer at this

20
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:02,570
arrested one that may be big difference
what we know is that its principles to

21
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,789
us in Google Docs but

22
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:09,720
conferences really good to me by people
who know better than me people who study

23
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,300
physics doesn't but

24
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,010
was not really in a good for the
audience that the exit ramp compute

25
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,140
computing in the physics way to start
with you you know the boss rail the

26
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:27,109
phenomenon is very complicated but they
don't bring the computer science way

27
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:34,400
which is similar to ours is a simple is
a fucking beats 101

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,800
qubits drugs or anyone else in time and
discard terrorized by gonna probably

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,530
gonna be negative number as a bit
counterintuitive negative probably did

30
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:54,780
but it makes sense and when you look at
the cubans before our 2012 same time and

31
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,860
then once you look at it stays your 14
ever and as defined by probably should

32
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:07,090
be done here they should and you should
probably be is this context for new team

33
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:15,080
member square and as it's a good
journalist you do more than 22 values to

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,900
do is go to theresa to bite or two GB
device anything you want

35
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,630
making a bagel it can be a computer and
dirty big ideas that when you have like

36
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,870
and it's a studio and possible values
are estate

37
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:39,610
bite you are a bit and 256 possible
values so announcing his dark with only

38
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,980
end Jibbitz you are able to encode due
to the end

39
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,570
different values and if we were to do it
unless your computer you will need to do

40
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:55,130
the end memory is impossible is possible

41
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,299
notion of state when register to reply

42
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,790
assembly and president is much simpler
than the assembly to classical simply

43
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,640
because you just have leader operations
like much of the biggest ones you don't

44
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:16,450
have things like and all it does and
does the computer science way to do it

45
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,728
so I don't expect you to understand I
gave us how it works but just tell you

46
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,810
the principal if you get a book you can
find this

47
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:31,370
very very easily and discussing and on
the computer because you need way too

48
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:40,600
much memory now I am here today is under
this single it basically means like

49
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:47,710
solving problems faster than with
classical on what's interesting is what

50
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:54,750
we got super speed up is making the
impossible possible and just as a

51
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:00,130
bridging bridging RSA and you can find a
list of all the conservatives on his

52
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:10,560
page when this when speed up to and
what's interesting is this problem

53
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,340
billion hidden subgroup problem there
heard about this but it's the kind of

54
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:25,729
problems behind during the RSA and
behind the government has broken just

55
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:30,950
because computers can solve this problem
if that's possible

56
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:36,250
forget about IRC Sec

57
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:46,870
which all are applied Internet becomes
insecure between GPs HDL US I saw though

58
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:54,669
the orbit going everything except what
would cause that don't you don't like

59
00:05:54,669 --> 00:06:02,520
mobile communications that unused
product keys cd keys 3G or 4G the WPA

60
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:11,780
pre-shared key and defuse public anger
but it's not like what would have been

61
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,989
completed as I wouldn't know how it
works but I mean making estimates and

62
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:24,340
technology we have today and I can send
millions of qubits and just be president

63
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:31,950
in Uganda factorization to take months
maybe in 20 years they're gonna weeks or

64
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,560
days but it's not

65
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:43,090
super super fast either the good news is
that another reason is broken door like

66
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,119
a yes

67
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,370
tribal dance on the stuff of functions
as only a boom in which means that it

68
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:57,950
impossible slightly less impossible that
a yes 128 what we use everyday it's a

69
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,780
tough one to be security

70
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,429
downgraded to 64 bit security forces and
the law

71
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:10,030
depending on how the frequency of
washington's of hash function such

72
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:16,840
classics to be done by 6128 and it
doesn't really hard to find conditions

73
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,789
USI something called contemplation
finding but its lower than finding the

74
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,160
beginning is that those are very simple
solution is to double the size of the

75
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,820
building harsh thanks and you known as a
good there is no windows no speed of the

76
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:41,840
dole not even the speed of light at the
end of problems as a doctor journey saw

77
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,780
two random people to think that
computers are doing everything I can to

78
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,739
combat problems solutions hard to find
but is it a very fine the struggles with

79
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,260
solutions are defined how to respond
until I start conferences fiction

80
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,389
problems are scheduling problems like
many video against have been proven and

81
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:11,520
abroad since she was a good idea to the
user's gonna throw them from the coffee

82
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,630
maker coffee

83
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:22,350
Resident Evil trying to do probably
heard about this mosque when and

84
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,639
cryptography some

85
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,009
General Scott Graham Saiful when
resistant to the idea is to find

86
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,659
alternatives to RSA to defend mind

87
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:36,510
herbs but do some functionality like
public encryption public against an

88
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:43,779
interest argument but did not deny not
broken by a computer it's easy to break

89
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:49,420
things as you know it's more difficult
to shreds it's not it's not broken when

90
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:55,099
one is that we're not totally sure that
this games gonna be broken

91
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:07,490
believe that it's not possible but
there's no hard evidence before but not

92
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:14,470
so easy to apply them in many cases and
accounted rodents are hard into oscar

93
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:20,510
has been on average each other the game
you want to be secure for all the key is

94
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:27,899
not just for certain ones and that's why
we're about to create and be based on

95
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:35,220
completeness and usefulness so why do we
talk about but because and its last year

96
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:44,269
so this document when decided it wanted
to know if I should be listed on Flickr

97
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:48,300
feed for commercial intensified and the
questions they want to integrate bottom

98
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,719
line I'm not a lot of speculation and
essays for Linda might be up to

99
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,320
something but you know about adding
bossman preparing the not so distant

100
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,800
future which means you know for
government I think tenuous 25 years but

101
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:18,250
will probably be at the time so I guess
that was published is saying there are

102
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:27,470
some people who owns this amazes was
very very known for their own

103
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,980
good point of view on cryptography
visited both theories about this like

104
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,630
the reasons why is it would be the first
one was there doing this because the gun

105
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,630
break Bussmann improved over and they
want you to use it to break your

106
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:49,790
interaction would be even some of the
people who find a solution that's not

107
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,709
the right one

108
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:59,670
made is that they can break our C so
here's the thing is that they want you

109
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,860
do switch + bonham but not to ECC not
yet the curves she would stick to

110
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:09,550
Arrecife while before 10 20 40 years
before you switch but anyone who would

111
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:17,630
be able to break because he deserves his
eyes he was thinking of government users

112
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:22,150
because it takes ages to make changes
that didn't want to force them to switch

113
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:30,380
to T C but i wanna discussion series on
nitrous right because people gave me

114
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:36,280
different opinions about his resume with
the more secure against computers

115
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:43,630
because there is more bits to break
things off medically the bodies of its

116
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:47,700
meaning that easy would be broken for us
and then they would just be a matter of

117
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:59,770
time you know the difference is the same
maybe russia and China investing in the

118
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:12,370
computer and games just waiting to be
heard about the duality fiasco are this

119
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,720
bad dog Karen G created by NASA
including several commercial brothers

120
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,950
and sons and themselves from these
precise estimate on Karen doesn't answer

121
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:30,890
or maybe just just risk management maybe
not even after all what about you about

122
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,590
us

123
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,230
should we care about possible so I guess
it's just through risk management do you

124
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,940
believe it or not it's not totally
irrational demands I'm not sure up some

125
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:46,180
people say hundreds of some people say
tomorrow

126
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,660
how one insurance price are you ready to
play in terms of performance double

127
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:57,180
deployment in terms of risk because I'm
idealistic

128
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:03,689
someone what's important to know his dad
it's way way more critical for an

129
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:10,480
encryption enforcing it was something I
received today it would be encrypted

130
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,630
would be decrypted a quantum computer is
created what is your sign something

131
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:24,320
today was our is easy to say well it has
to reach you must ensure it is about to

132
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:35,460
be walking and revoke your design their
own computers

133
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:42,860
encryption and then not sure if you want
to change now the best recommendation is

134
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,820
what people from repeating group project
have been doing a project on invaluable

135
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:55,110
noon but by then bursting and other guys
doing blowjob and encrypt and proposing

136
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,910
mcaleese maybe never heard about this is
something you that created she dates

137
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:09,719
back to the late 70 78 or 79 did the
first lady mrs. things behind the part

138
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,100
about it either but also goes back to
the eighties is very well endorses games

139
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,540
and a few dozen different routes for
example has recently what doesn't mean

140
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:29,829
in terms of performance of storage if
used this house based games like to do

141
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,700
crazy things

142
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:40,460
xavier is a bit bigger than our soldiers
it 41 yards and 12 rebounds of keys and

143
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,580
spray slow

144
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:49,010
same difference here is that so many
objections it will be done by someone

145
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:54,920
about performance like an 06 your boat
in some cases tonight's my work hard

146
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:06,240
real-time I heard about the wave the way
its peak when I'm contemplating company

147
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,280
company since 1999 they've been walking
on cloud computing is a private company

148
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:20,360
a good job and their solutions to go
there must be up to something being and

149
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:29,700
became too much into it doesn't do bees
I gotta say not as I do not know the

150
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,690
reasoning is dead do something but is
not a quantum computer is not a

151
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,720
universal quantum computer can do
everything they can do it is something

152
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:46,650
called a meeting which is a version of
simulated annealing which is a kind of

153
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,230
made her sick which is a kind of
technique to solve discrete optimization

154
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:56,730
problem but the most important to know
is that it's gonna break under Chirag

155
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:04,030
reason that soldiers civilians a problem
you need to carry about what he is doing

156
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:09,329
if it was worried about too much and
what they're doing is only partially

157
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,540
related to the problem of building a
scalable universal quantum computer some

158
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,670
of their search my head but not know
never seen so I had a pretty good at 10

159
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:24,430
doing but the question is how useful is
it is used for some problems the news

160
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:30,589
that US couple months me margaret this
is headline on google says when Google's

161
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:36,580
said something people usually go says
its juries hundred million times faster

162
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:44,070
than BC by one in mind going or whatever
and speaker from from Google in six

163
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:49,350
people from Google this computer is
gonna miss you too from the wave is

164
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,550
written million times faster

165
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,359
actually

166
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,500
what they did is that they took a
specific problem able dedicated hardware

167
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,209
for his very specific problem and had
been trucked it against the classical

168
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:08,799
computer using some software running on
a general CPU using algorithm that it

169
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,970
was not till tomorrow on God was not the
optimized and asymptotically

170
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:21,839
very large problems in some cases the
conversion was faster than their 2011

171
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,918
doesn't mean that it's interesting to
read faster and custom computer and some

172
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:36,090
people freedom and display machine guns
and blog they spend is very likely since

173
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:43,428
they were shot at least you manage top
secret level access to important things

174
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:49,640
to do this since his operation Anchorage
data entry ended address should manage

175
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,090
degrees currently in the bus phrases may
be used secure hardware store it

176
00:17:54,090 --> 00:18:00,168
securely usual others bring further
cause the best Britain least and

177
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:09,320
blackmail in people between mia has
large not give thirty sevens do beats

178
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:16,340
gives you but when trained by security
if you see at least 256 bit curves for

179
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:25,439
120 security symmetry ciphers 256 and if
you do everything he write in Europe

180
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:33,520
ended up 1% from what I've seen it's
very difficult to get all this now when

181
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,679
you've done august maybe you can stop
worrying about home computers and data

182
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:45,250
move to something must be done but under
800 series don't be done by the hype
