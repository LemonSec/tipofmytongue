00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,790
a few years ago Kristen did a fantastic
presentation on RFID of all sorts of

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,500
Khan and one of the pieces are there was
an active defense system called guard

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:20,150
money and she is going to talk about
guard money as well as showing that it

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,599
is out in released into the wild so that
anybody can make one of these and it's a

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,470
very interesting because it is in fact
an active defense system so it's great

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:35,680
pleasure that I will introduce Kristen
here to talk about guard money

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:51,680
good morning let me start out by by
giving thanks to a few people got money

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,640
wouldn't exist without certain folks
first of all JP when germany was created

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,140
at a glance up I was a part of JP JP did
all the initial PCB designing a lot of

10
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,680
work on the antennas we learned a lot
about how PCB trace antennas work in

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,060
RFID because of JP it wouldn't be what
it is today without paying huge AP Henry

12
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,869
in the recursion recursion was my
startup and recursion with the vehicle

13
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,299
that allowed guard money to to come
about

14
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:24,580
so you know again got money wouldn't
exist without recursion and in some of

15
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:30,009
the recursion crew here thank you all I
really appreciate it I'm sales force my

16
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:35,710
employer when I was accepted to speaker
Shahrukh Khan I was really blown away by

17
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,229
the level of support that I got from
Salesforce they paid for all of my PCBs

18
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,720
they paid for my parts they paid my
prototypes for me to come here and they

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,360
actually tried really hard to build a
working God money to go into everyone's

20
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,390
right back but we just couldn't do it
because there wasn't enough time so I

21
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,030
i've been completely blown away by you
know the commitment that Salesforce is

22
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,750
shown so thank you Brandon Thank You
Salesforce I should also say we are

23
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,760
hiring on both coasts and various other
places so

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,539
work for a company that values you as a
person as well as a job function please

25
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:15,760
send me an email I talk to a lot of
Engineers about hard money for a few

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,959
years has been the kind of thing that
any time I've met up with anyone who

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,830
knows anything about the low levels of
RFID pick their brain about some of the

28
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,120
problems that have been facing hand so
this this isn't all me a lot of credit

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,720
to a lot of people who've given me I did
for for ways to improve things but last

30
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,470
but by no means least my wife Erin I
know she's watching hi babe little-known

31
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:46,320
fact about me I cannot sold a surface
mount technology for shit I just get my

32
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,750
hands are too big I just a condom so
anytime I try build a new device I get a

33
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,830
pilot PCBs a pilot components and give
her a few days and she's amazing at it

34
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:02,910
she never gets bored of it so thanks for
hey let's get on with it so its

35
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:10,040
political theory about company first off
what is it's what he's got money it's an

36
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,079
active RFID shield what I mean by that

37
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,250
so conventional RFID shields the way
they work as they try to surround the

38
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,910
the tag with metal in such a way that
all of the incident energy is absorbed

39
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:30,060
by that metal and doesn't reach the tag
the problem with it is these things that

40
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,500
they they called Faraday cages then not
actual Faraday cages unless you grounder

41
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,400
and so because none of these shields are
grounded if you hit them with enough

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,830
power you can charge the shield itself
and then the shield becomes effectively

43
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:48,140
and an RAF proxy to the tag that's
inside it so essentially if you hit it

44
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,679
with enough power to saturate the shield
you punch through you read the tag when

45
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,470
he takes a different approach

46
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,940
company absorbs that signal and uses it
it it spits out energy back at the

47
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:05,019
reader so if you put more energy into
guard by any company just start shouting

48
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:10,150
louder it doesn't matter how much energy
you put into a min eventually there's a

49
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,829
there's a failure case that will discuss
but it's in general

50
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:15,500
better

51
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,310
handling stronger signals than any
passive shield that exists

52
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,350
bernie is a lot like an RFID tag it has
a lot of characteristics that make it

53
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,850
very RFID like it also has a lot of
characteristics that can make it very

54
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:36,170
not RFID like you get into that but for
the context of the purpose of this talk

55
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:42,280
when I say RFID contactless or NFC
they're all the same thing I'm working

56
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,609
very very low level in in the ISO 14443
stack so at this level they're always

57
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,210
saying things so you know yes this is
for clipper cards and yes this is for

58
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,810
your I class card to get into your
building and its contactless payment is

59
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:02,540
your passport if it runs a 13.5 six
megahertz it's it's you know God bunnies

60
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,870
target technology so when they say it's
a little different from an RFID tag what

61
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,290
I mean

62
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:15,640
well if you compared me and you can see
that the bunny logo 11 the caffeinated I

63
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,500
is one of my favorite things you can add
money to my fake plastic and I class

64
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,320
they just you know 22 very popular tax
and they're all passively power they all

65
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,599
receive their power from the reader they
have no power sources of their own their

66
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,680
active devices they have chips in them
they may have transistors they switch

67
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,470
they make decisions about how to operate
they communicate via load modulation

68
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,260
what I mean by that is that the reader
is putting out energy and the tag is

69
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,050
deciding how much to consume and if it
consumes more than that the signal of

70
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,020
the reader drops it consumes less the
reader the signal the reader comes up

71
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,020
and you can use that to transfer data
that slowed modulation all of these

72
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,690
devices communicate violate modulation
including guard many things start to get

73
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,620
a little bit different is when you look
at how much memory they have my vote

74
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,680
last week and I class you can get both
of these technologies with up to four

75
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,630
kilobytes of storage gardening has four
bits

76
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,960
that's it for bits of memory half a bite
that's that's enough to do what it does

77
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,020
likewise

78
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,878
that memory is not it is volatile so the
moment the power goes away those four

79
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,560
bits just kinda vanish into the ether
there is no nonvolatile storage on God

80
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:40,409
money anyway there was also no CPU on
God by me anyway no processor at all

81
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:49,889
it's it it is incapable of executing
code of any kind so well

82
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:54,259
operation is to start with an antenna
and you choose the antenna it's it's a

83
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:58,150
fairly standard RFID think it's it's a
inductor and capacitor and you make it

84
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:04,190
resonate and and it's from the antenna
you extract power to regulate now with a

85
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,389
power supply once you've got power
coming out of the power supply you use

86
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:16,819
it to power for counter counter output
is driving a modulator demodulator is

87
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:20,960
ultimately controlled by a limiter and
the limiter then interact back with the

88
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,539
June antenna so you've got this giant
loop if you look at it kind of the top

89
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:31,259
side it's it's power management and at
the bottom side its signal management so

90
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:36,340
it's it's it's it's fairly simple
operation will will will get into the

91
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:42,369
the exact specifics in just a moment
here why are we using a four-bit counter

92
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:48,050
well if you look at the ISO 14443
specifications they use NFC 16

93
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,080
subcarrier so what that means is that
the data isn't directly modulated onto

94
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,960
the 13.5 six megahertz carrier you
modulate a 847 kilohertz subcarrier

95
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:07,539
signal onto that the primary 13 56
carriers so effectively 847 kilohertz is

96
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:13,449
13.5 six megahertz 2/16 it's the
frequency of the carrier divided by 16 F

97
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:20,729
C 16 SEC 16 a critical in all ISO 14443
applications whether its type A or Type

98
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:26,370
II it doesn't matter they all based on
ISO 14443 even things like my class that

99
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,810
it's not wonderful 43 compliant it it
still uses some of the lower layers and

100
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,820
it still uses actually 16 modulation

101
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:42,270
so every 16 is critical and we've got a
four-bit counter counter has 16 possible

102
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,610
states which means that there are 16
things that it can do and if you take

103
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:53,950
that output signal that every 16 cycles
and you feed it into a modulator

104
00:08:53,950 --> 00:09:00,760
modulating a taxi 16 so God bernie is
effectively just clocking out ISO 14443

105
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:11,189
compliant modulation is just spinning
out F C 16 y while the tax communicating

106
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:17,270
via Etsy $16.00 bunnies spitting out F C
16 if you put the two together the

107
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,340
reader can tell them apart and the
simple idea is that a lot of these tags

108
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,520
that the exchanges a cryptographic so if
God but he can induce enough noise that

109
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,660
I flip a single bit equipment sales the
reader gives up the whole thing aborts

110
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,270
and gardening wins if I can be
synchronized the timing of the reader in

111
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,840
the tag maybe I can phase shift it by
four cycles at that point the reader can

112
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,220
communicate with the tag anymore and got
money wins there's any number of

113
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,240
different different failure scenarios
that I could induce into the

114
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,020
communication between reader and tagged
by injecting a c16 that any one of them

115
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,270
would work so I don't necessarily need
to be the loudest device I don't need to

116
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,000
to silence the energy I don't need to
obliterate the signal will have to be as

117
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,100
loud enough to be heard for one bit
somewhere in the transaction that's what

118
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,460
god but he does loud enough to be heard
is good enough

119
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:20,130
that's that's what it comes down to so

120
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:26,410
I was always taught that when you
talking about how something works you

121
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,270
should always start with the schematic
and I'm just gonna kind of ramble on for

122
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,540
a second here about nothing in
particular the actual engineers in the

123
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,050
audience can look at that and wonder
what the hell I'm doing i will walk

124
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,930
through this stage by stage but I did
want to kind of put the whole thing up

125
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,719
just for a moment for people to see
we'll come back to it and in a moment so

126
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,650
let's walk through the various stages so
first love you got the antenna it's it's

127
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,030
nothing particularly special it's a
resonant circuit it's a typical RFID

128
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:01,510
antenna the thing that's strange about
this is that short circuit around L one

129
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:06,500
and the reason for this is because in
Eagle CAD there's no way to mark a while

130
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,250
as having an inductance so we have to do
is put an inductor short it with a wire

131
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:17,070
because the wire actually is the antenna
but gets crazy because now these two

132
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,210
nets shorted together in a way that
they're actually not and the wire kind

133
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,110
of wires like a wire that goes all the
way around the border is kinda corrected

134
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:30,630
just it's a screwy thing about Eagle
electrically its kinda correct but it

135
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,840
still doesn't look great I'm choosing
these things is tricky if you want to

136
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,880
build one example if you were turns
think I saw scope probe on the antenna

137
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,439
and then hit with 13.5 six megahertz
you're not gonna be able to choose

138
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,100
because in this case this this
particular board it requires a fifty to

139
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,500
pick a favorite in her two children
while the import your oscilloscope has

140
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,590
probably got 10 to 15 P coseratz of
capacitance on that show you now

141
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,750
completely screwed up your choosing its
you actually have to build out the

142
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,960
entire device and measure the voltage
that comes out of the power supply the

143
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,690
back end in order to be decoupled enough
that you can reasonably measure the

144
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,050
tuning and it's it's good to use one
board sammich it together and one drives

145
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,359
the other sealed Europe and tennis match
are happy to have a long conversation

146
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,820
with anyone who wants to design RFID
antennas on PCBs I have learned many

147
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,600
heartless

148
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,009
so the next stage is the power supply
and this is where the the party really

149
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:40,000
starts so you can think of this as to
harvest of a full-wave rectifier so the

150
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,490
top you've got a positive phase of the
bottom you've got a negative phase and

151
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,019
the line in the middle you can think of
as a ground so each half if we look at

152
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:56,930
the top half of that c1 c2 d1 d to form
a classic voltage doubler and so in

153
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:03,199
addition to rectifying ac/dc each half
double the voltage and then you've got

154
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,560
to hards so that doubles the voltage
again so with very few components I've

155
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,268
got a voltage quadrupolar even better
than that if you look at the arrangement

156
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:20,589
of Sadie 1 in D to D one has a forward
voltage drop of seven bowls which means

157
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:24,850
that if the signal on my antenna is less
than point seven votes

158
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,569
I'm not gonna get anything out of the
power supply and then you look at D one

159
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:34,550
look at D to detail actually upward bias
is that point to compensate for the

160
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,420
forward voltage drop so overall there is
no forward voltage drop from any of the

161
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,139
diode and you've got a voltage quadruple
so you got a very very efficient power

162
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:48,839
supply very good at getting you know
getting high voltage enough to turn on

163
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:54,139
chips from you know just a few hundred
million volts of impact at the very end

164
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:59,350
of the power supply the LEDs and OLEDs
actually serve as voltage regulators so

165
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,800
if you mention like I said the middle
line is ground top line is positive

166
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,589
bottom line is negative you connect your
logic between the two

167
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:13,699
you've got twice each phase so those two
LEDs in Syria's in this version I'm

168
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:18,060
using red LEDs so there's typically have
a forward voltage about 1.8 volts to

169
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,160
those in serious when she got three
points 6 goals and that's the voltage my

170
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,579
logic runs out if it gets any higher the
LEDs conduct shut up our way and light

171
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:32,258
up so they have a couple of a couple
good purposes both as an alert and as a

172
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:35,260
as a voltage regulator

173
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:41,360
countering mentioned it's really not
special it's any old phobic counter work

174
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,210
I've used 34 in incurred by me and had
no problems as long as it's a binary

175
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:52,000
counter because you 1/16 not divide by
10 the key specifications turn-on

176
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,150
voltage at this particular logic family
turns onto volts you can get logic

177
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,750
families that turn on lower voltage but
they start getting really really really

178
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:06,490
expensive and not that much benefit
there comes a point where you just might

179
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,560
have enough voltage to technically turn
on you don't have enough current to

180
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,369
power the thing you don't have enough
power over also to some extent to which

181
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:23,090
is about the sweet spot on the left the
the clear load in peint wires are all

182
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,560
shorted together and go up to the the
positive rail I have no idea what those

183
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,479
pins do all I know is that the datasheet
said if you don't connect these four

184
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,230
pins the positive rail your counter will
not count so you know I have had

185
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,340
occasions where have burned PCBs because
it didn't read the data sheet for the

186
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,220
counter and it didn't show the right
pins so do check the data sheets on this

187
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,020
also make sure to take a 13.5 six
megahertz block a lot of the lower

188
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:55,490
voltage logic families the speed that
they can operate at decreases as voltage

189
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,610
decreases and so a lot of them you get
down to it you can achieve all levels

190
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,590
and the lone o'clock at five megahertz
so you know things get a little screwy

191
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:10,370
down that the modulator is effectively
just a switch that's all it is it's a

192
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,150
switch this controlled by an electrical
signal socially to MOSFETs back-to-back

193
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,010
they they make him a nice little
packages that you don't have to worry

194
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,120
about pairing the virtual switching
speed and voltage rating crucial

195
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,940
obviously you don't go releasing any
magic smoke you don't wanna be switching

196
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:31,870
slower than the single needs to go the
basic logic is the the e input on pin

197
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:37,950
for that's the enable when they enable
pin goes high winds 1210 shorted

198
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:44,690
together and that's all it does is
actually very handy parts so you take in

199
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,440
one of the top of the coil pin to the
bottom of the coil

200
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,250
and you now have a lot more chill later
it's not complicated

201
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:58,460
the problem with load modulating that
way is if you imagine you've got your

202
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:04,209
counter and the counter counts I and
eventually which is the modulator on the

203
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:09,770
moderator shorts the coil together and
the signal stops the problem is the

204
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,879
single has not stopped so you've got a
counter input clock going to the counter

205
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,900
to the clock will stop taking and it
will never turn off the modulator so

206
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,630
we've got to do is make sure that
there's at least a minimum bid of

207
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,920
voltage present on the coil so that you
can drive the clock in so that you can

208
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,360
actually modulate that's what these two
diodes to effectively they guarantee

209
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,340
that at least the forward voltage drop
of a diode is present on the coil and

210
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:46,320
you're off to the races so bring it all
back together I mean that's you know ten

211
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,960
minutes of electrical failure just
explain the entire device from first

212
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,580
principles it's it's really not a
complicated thing it's it's amazing how

213
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,560
simple things get when you do them in
analog sometimes the the math behind it

214
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:08,960
gets kinda crazy but it's easier when
you don't have to write code ok so demo

215
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,120
time actually have three demos to show
you so let's get cracking

216
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:21,459
first of this is a standard off the
shelf commercial contactless credit card

217
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,310
reader

218
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:30,340
preseason shots you about it to 60 bucks
an expired before you get that idea

219
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,149
contactless credit card was issued to me
by Chase and if you apply one to the

220
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,620
other

221
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:43,399
beads and you can keep making a beat as
long as you like and I happy and to God

222
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:51,090
by what we can do is if I if I sit guard
by me on top of the contactless credit

223
00:18:51,090 --> 00:19:13,459
card and then hold both of them to the
reader

224
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:22,760
energy and you can see quite nicely

225
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:29,470
the next show is with my cell phone is
my cell phone has an NFC reader in it

226
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,789
which as i mentioned is exactly the same
thing but in this case is just a little

227
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:37,260
lower power weathers guys putting out
about putting out about two hundred and

228
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:44,299
fifty million this is putting out about
fifty so if I take my clipper card and a

229
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:48,658
slight bit to the phone

230
00:19:48,659 --> 00:20:00,909
by me and I sit on the trigger guard and
I presented to the phone so again it

231
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:06,200
works at low energy levels as well but
you can see the LEDs are lighting up at

232
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,359
all there isn't enough power to to
actually need that that load regulation

233
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:15,789
just stay off and you'll hear me from
time to time before their eyes

234
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:19,869
the original idea was that the that the
bunny logo with the stupid categorize

235
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:30,019
would have the LEDs in the middle of it
so I just extra caffeine so I tested it

236
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:34,379
with a class tags are tested it with
half a dozen different tags on readers

237
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:42,738
with the exception of the occasional
prototype pledge what I do wanna show

238
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:50,710
you though the final demo is how it
fails and overseas

239
00:20:50,710 --> 00:21:00,059
contactless card oh my god money and it
doesn't read if I offset them a little

240
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:15,500
bit like so little niggling but it read
them all if it's easily one of the big

241
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:21,120
ways in which card but he fails the
antenna on this has to be coincident

242
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,209
with the antenna on this in order to get
these and protection and I'll come back

243
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:32,490
to that now so it's kind of a segue into
some of the improvements that are

244
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:37,039
possible care benefits as I mentioned it
savvy one device is a prototype is proof

245
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:46,610
of concept but it has potential to
improve it well I mention the antenna

246
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,740
geometry if the antenna geometry doesn't
match then you've got a potential

247
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,000
problem and there's some things that we
can do to help improve that and some

248
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,640
clever PSU some clever tricks of the
power supply that that might make things

249
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,049
even better and the counter chair
there's a there's a really ugly but

250
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:10,720
really subtle and really strange problem
with the counter check that I'll come

251
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,850
back to that needs a slightly strange
approach to solve it but it is solvable

252
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,480
and the modulator itself that whether it
works at the moment it could be improved

253
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,899
so I talked about that a little power
supply in love with this power supply it

254
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:32,149
it's kind of awesome one of the things
that I like about it is that if you take

255
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:36,299
a card by me and you take the chips off
there's now nothing consuming power

256
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:42,179
except the LEDs and so you've actually
got a really efficient RFID detector so

257
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:46,630
if I hold it might make contactless card
and have this is a gardening with just a

258
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:53,760
power supply in the LEDs you can see it
starts ok

259
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:10,590
so if I bring the reader close there's
like the eyes lighting up from this far

260
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:18,120
away in fact if I sit Guardian bunny on
a table next to a reader the isolator

261
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:27,909
it's a really efficient possibly works
really well so and then additional

262
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,870
there's this interesting possibilities
to have some fun with the alert on guard

263
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:39,129
money so we'll talk about that a little
so magnetic flux so many as a coil the

264
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:44,570
the trace that goes around the edge of
the PCB is a coil coil is work is if you

265
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,040
look inside on like in this picture you
have lines of magnetic flux coming up

266
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,409
through the middle of the coil and they
run they run around the coil in kind of

267
00:23:53,410 --> 00:24:05,230
a donut shape and if I have two tags
offset like this and I applied magnetic

268
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,520
flux to one of them

269
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,200
the one on the left and the one on the
right won't see the same amount of

270
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,540
floods because you know not all of the
flux lines of being captured by the

271
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,290
antennas in the same way what that means
is the Flex doesn't match between the

272
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:24,040
two devices which means that the
available power doesn't match between

273
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,110
the two devices and you've now got a
mismatch between device a device be and

274
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:37,409
it's possible to power device be but not
device a so it's kind of a pretty

275
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,700
serious weaknesses God but his biggest
problem at the moment

276
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:47,430
fortunately there's there's a series of
fixes that range from easy to all my god

277
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:54,160
wizardry electronics that can address
the basic solution is to use lots of

278
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:00,540
antennas if I'm offset like like like
this if I actually have two antennas one

279
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,620
that's here and one that's here

280
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:09,040
a good set of matching with this flux
you know me better protection so if I

281
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,360
have lots and lots and lots of antennas
the more antennas I have the more

282
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,100
accurately I can match God bunnies
antenna geometry to the tags antenna

283
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:22,189
geometry and maybe stand a better chance
of preventing the read so the crude way

284
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:26,240
to do it is you just copy and paste
multiple copies of God money onto a PCB

285
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:34,040
there's not a lot of components here you
could easily fit 12 maybe 15 guard

286
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,450
bunnies on a single single circuit board
you can see that the space of useful

287
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,110
components here is relatively small and
I could have compress that down a lot

288
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:47,300
more so you can put a lot of complete
guard bunnies on one single device can

289
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,110
accrue though because at that point each
device has its own clock and well

290
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:58,260
universal thing so a better approach
would be to give each antenna its own

291
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,720
power supply combine the power supply is
in serious that we get the highest

292
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,280
voltage we possibly can and empower 1+1
counter chip so that that's not too

293
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,870
difficult we can do that and then the
ultimate would be to manipulate the

294
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:20,689
phase of the antennas themselves so if
you imagine if you consider like that

295
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,670
the coils in these two and I'm hitting
them with a magnetic field if the

296
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:29,920
devices like this they will be perfectly
in chains if the devices are beside each

297
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,480
other they will be perfectly

298
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,570
out of phase and so as they overlap more
or less

299
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:41,000
there's a phase shift from 0 to 180 so
what you need to do in order to combine

300
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,200
all of these antennas is this phase
shift each antenna at the antenna level

301
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,520
and then combine them into one big
antenna that you then use with one power

302
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:56,020
supply and one counter again now that's
a level of wages wizardry that exceeds

303
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,040
me by some significant margin so I'll
talk about it but I am lockerbie

304
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,210
building in anytime soon and then with
all of these you just treated as one big

305
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:10,980
and Tennessee modulate the mall has one
antenna together it's a relatively

306
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,370
simple approach and it should be fairly
effective

307
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:21,350
I mentioned that counter impose so if
you look at the systematic what's up now

308
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:27,199
that the very top rachel is the the
rolled coil voltage and you can see

309
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,740
that's driving the clock inputs on the
counter chair

310
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,640
well the reason for that is because when
the voltage at the coil is very very low

311
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,800
you still want to be able to see their
account the clock ticking typically the

312
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,110
clock being able to take his what limits
card but his ability to turn on a low

313
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:50,020
energy it's it's the size of that that
that oscillation on the coil the problem

314
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,980
is when you start getting very very
close to the reader and voltages are

315
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:58,300
going way up that starts exceeding the
allowable input voltage range for the

316
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,220
chip which point the protection diodes
kick in and they shouldn't away all of

317
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,530
that excess power ground it gives us two
things going on

318
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:11,059
firstly with bleeding power away which
is wasting power shutting it to ground

319
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:15,809
that's good power that we could be using
to generate more modulation but instead

320
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:21,480
we just sent it around so that's that's
not optimal secondly really supposed to

321
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,610
use the protection diodes on logic
inputs like this like they work and you

322
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,979
can and you can get away with it but it
makes things much more sensitive to

323
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:36,460
static have blown up a bunch of these
things with static she says touching the

324
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:43,809
ground at medal podium again and just
it's just generally not a good idea so

325
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:48,350
the way to fix it is not with a
traditional power supply circuit

326
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:53,230
breakers if you take a resistor and a
zener diode the way that that circuit

327
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:57,679
works is once you get above the voltage
of the zener diode Zener conduct shuns

328
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,280
the power ground we don't want to be
shunting away power so how do we do this

329
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,320
this solution is clever impedance
trickery we want low impedance a low

330
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,480
voltage that the signal can just get
straight through because we want the

331
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,990
chip to turn on quickly at high voltage
we want high impedance because we want

332
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,010
to limit how much power is getting to
that

333
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:23,640
we also very picky about up how it's
going to be very efficient so we don't

334
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,320
want it to be shunted so what do you do
this this doesn't really sound like any

335
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:35,840
common power supply approach when you
start doing crazy things are 7805 how

336
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,600
many people have ever seen this
arrangement of a constant voltage

337
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:47,550
regulator so if you use a constant
voltage regulator like this you actually

338
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:52,320
turn it into a constant current
regulator so we can do is if you use a

339
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,000
voltage regulator like this and you turn
into a constant current regulator you

340
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,790
look up the impact current for the chip
that you are using and you regulate to

341
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:06,180
exactly that much current and everything
else is just taking care of the voltage

342
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,950
gets too high well ok I malted regulator
I can deal with that it's it's a really

343
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:16,870
neat trick that I'm I'm really irritated
I didn't think of myself so I mean

344
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,060
obviously you wouldn't use a 7805 cuz
you know it wouldn't really fit well

345
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,440
with the Euro 2012 on the circuit board
so you do some kind of you know I

346
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,780
efficiency LDO regulator there is an odd
thing about picking a voltage if you're

347
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,770
implementing the circuit voltage has to
be high enough that it's going to trip

348
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:38,920
the the input logic thresholds on the
counter but the higher voltage is the

349
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,420
more power is going through that resists
the more power you are wasting just

350
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,750
heating that resist so there's a very
fine balance to be struck you have to be

351
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:50,440
a little more careful with how that
works especially because of the dynamic

352
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,290
range problem of you know very very low
energy versus very very high energy and

353
00:30:54,290 --> 00:31:00,850
you have to work at both the modulator I
mentioned at the moment the way that it

354
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:06,020
works is essentially if the power supply
has too much power dump it through the

355
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:11,810
LEDs is the modulator is on
short-circuit a coil these two things

356
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:17,919
that are kind of independent it's much
easier built that way but what happens

357
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,570
is a high-energy way too much power goes
to the LEDs so if you look just a card

358
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,649
by Nehemiah my high-power reader you can
see what's up close

359
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:35,370
be bright enough to do the one with the
modulator led specifically because they

360
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:39,080
have a hundred 80 degree field of view
the ones that have used in the past with

361
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,689
a 10 degree field of view like this they
are blinding it turns out issues these

362
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,890
guys are actually switching on and off
at 13.5 six megahertz and it turns out

363
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:55,220
that if you drive LEDs that way you can
weigh out of specification and they

364
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,250
don't blow up and that's exactly what's
happening here they're being driven away

365
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,260
out of spec but because they they get
half a phase to recover every time they

366
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:15,720
say yes too much power LEDs is just it's
it's a waste of modulation ultimately

367
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,360
and it's all about the modulation debt
so instead another approach that you

368
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,979
could take allow the council played a
charge endlessly and just go up and up

369
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,710
and up and up and up and voltage now
bear in mind without the LEDs on this

370
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:34,090
power supply here can easily reach 200
balls

371
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,080
we're not talking about small changes
which were going out fairly high

372
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,110
voltages

373
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:41,840
when you charge of these insights cash
you got a good amount of energy stored

374
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,280
there that to charge up and the
modulated turns on you just dump that

375
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:53,490
power into the LEDs the idea being that
once you dump all of her parents the

376
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:57,570
LEDs the power supply needs to charge up
again which means that it pulls power

377
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,970
from the antenna which means that the
voltage on the antenna drops in your now

378
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:08,330
load modulating again so it's kind of
exploiting the back propagation of power

379
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,810
consumption through back to the antenna
which ok it's probably gonna be slightly

380
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:18,149
out of phase but there may not be a bad
thing because maybe sometimes make my

381
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:24,070
job here is to confuse the reader so if
one cycle a generate AFC 15 another

382
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:27,639
slightly generate a C-seventeen I don't
know what the readings gonna do with

383
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,100
that but I'm pretty sure gonna like it
if it a thousand times in quick

384
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,800
succession night I might have a chance
of blocking the reeds

385
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,970
power supply itself I mention that I'm I
quite like the power supply it works

386
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,280
very well it's snowing compensated diet
drops its very high efficiency

387
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,050
multiplier in there that doesn't
actually work out or Forex multiplier

388
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:55,270
because you know efficiency happens but
it's it certainly gives you a lot more

389
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:00,080
voltage out then you put into it it's
it's a it's a good power supply even a

390
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,449
side of the the trickery with a
modulator we could avoid dumping power

391
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:07,160
LEDs a different way just by again
putting a constant current regulator on

392
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,200
them that would actually cost us
anything it's just a couple more

393
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,219
components on the board between the
power supply in the LEDs that would work

394
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,620
fairly well I mentioned we've got a
Forex voltage multiplier we can actually

395
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,799
go higher multiples if we wanted to have
an experiment with it because there

396
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,130
comes a point where the the deficiency
drop so much that you know actually

397
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:32,429
getting any net net gain from going to
hire multipliers I think that's about

398
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:37,120
where I'm out and about on that balance
point but there may be fun to be had

399
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,168
there I don't know and then like way
switch mode power supplies switch mode

400
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:44,969
is notoriously good with taking very
very low voltages and doing useful

401
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:50,489
things with the problem is I'm already
in a switching environment so I've got a

402
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:57,109
13.5 six megahertz signal who knows
maybe I could drive my switcher c16

403
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:01,570
frequencies and i know im I'm not much
of a switchboard engineer so I haven't

404
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,790
really tackle the problem

405
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:09,150
the other thing to bear in mind is that
in RFID you talking about a magnetic

406
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:13,310
field so the field strength drops off as
the inverse cuba's the distance from the

407
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:20,430
reader which means that since power is
the square of voltage and voltage is

408
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:25,390
directly related to the the magnetic
field strength you're available power

409
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:30,170
drops off as the six power distance so
by the time you're going far away you

410
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,990
are on tiny tiny tiny fractions of power
and it doesn't really matter how many

411
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,479
votes you bumped up to

412
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,860
they just aren't enough you just don't
have the energy to do anything no matter

413
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,090
what the voltage actually

414
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:46,890
so like I said that the power supply as
far as I'm aware is reasonably optimal

415
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,879
but I'd love to be proved wrong

416
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,400
alerting options so the moment you have
the the LEDs but you also have a counter

417
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,640
another way to think of a counter is as
a frequency divider so what you could do

418
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,379
is instead of taking a fullback counter
and dividing by sixteen you can attend

419
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:09,370
accountant divide by 1024 that takes you
from 13.5 six megahertz to about 13

420
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:14,220
killer herds and now you're an audio
frequencies so if you look at this

421
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,129
its 10th to 14th at all in the audio
frequency range and you could just why

422
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:23,180
that directly up to appease her sound
what you can even do a little logic

423
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:29,549
equation up here if you want to take you
16 which is a very slow you know at

424
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:35,690
least significant bit changing if you
were to use that to select between two

425
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:39,540
of the other towns and I'm pretty sure
you do that was like three logic gates

426
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:44,140
and then you've got a two tone siren
even so there's there's all kinds of

427
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:49,830
stuff that you can do there's definitely
enough power driver Bluetooth Low Energy

428
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:55,049
chip so you could absolutely put a chip
on that every time card when he wakes up

429
00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:01,150
owner says he is an RFID field you being
read that that would absolutely work and

430
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:05,840
the the great thing is because the power
supply in gardening so flexible if you

431
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,880
don't have enough power to drive the
chip will you do to increase the size of

432
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:15,790
the tank capacitors on the power supply
and well now have enough power it's it's

433
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,960
not hard really is very low energy it's
it's very well suited to this

434
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,150
application is also a lot of user
interface possibilities even a card form

435
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:32,610
factor coin yeah okay so coin is this
this credit card sized device that it it

436
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,550
does funky things with your credit cards
that you probably don't wanna know about

437
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:43,040
but the point is it's it's a normal ISO
standard credit-card sized form factor

438
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,259
device with a baton and the screen and a
battery in a CPU and Abby Lee radio you

439
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,010
can use all of these things on God

440
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,830
so it's absolutely you know lots and
lots and lots of possibilities to put a

441
00:37:54,830 --> 00:38:00,740
screen on and show how many times your
cards have been rare that I could do

442
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:08,839
failure modes how does God many fail
this four main ways that God first and

443
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,000
foremost is the antennas not matching
now we talked about that a little bit

444
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,460
what I don't think is that I don't think
they can ever be a perfect antenna

445
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:22,020
design I think that the problem is too
complex and too many possibilities of of

446
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:29,610
of possibilities of antenna a and
antenna be combining entirely possible

447
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:34,270
that someone could prove me wrong please
do I'm looking for is good enough so

448
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,930
let's let's you know it would be nice to
transcend different antenna design

449
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,000
refinements good enough

450
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,470
way way way too much power into a while
first thing that happens is the LEDs

451
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:51,080
will die fast they are the voltage
limiters so eventually they're just

452
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:57,930
gonna stop working they will probably
fail open so they fell short they fail

453
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,750
open which means that now you've got
nothing limiting the voltage and power

454
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:08,130
supply voltage power supply goes up and
up and up and up getting into the 200

455
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:14,350
voltage range the chips will already be
dead so you know if you keep putting

456
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:21,040
more power into it that voltage voltage
quadruple the chips will die eventually

457
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,860
the power supply caps will die and
that's probably the point at which you

458
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,350
actually see magic smoke being released
when you when you were overcharged at

459
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,980
the surface mount devices they they
sometimes go off like little

460
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:36,810
firecrackers little durable anyway

461
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:45,100
after that long dead at that point the
moment the chip slider not generating a

462
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:50,319
c16 so you've got no functionality you
could protect against this very easily

463
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,160
by adding a high-voltage zener diode
across the the power supply if you just

464
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,870
can't a crowbar that and say you know
what forget to a hundred miles on the

465
00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:03,509
power supply just just pleased but then
that itself can be hit with more power

466
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:07,340
eventually that will die but I think
that's the point at which if you're able

467
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:11,050
to kill your high voltage dina Titus
protecting guard by me when God when he

468
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:15,590
dies and pretty sure the next thing
today is gonna be you are tagged so as

469
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:22,770
long as God many dies before the RFID
tag dies we still had another couple of

470
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:26,410
good attacks that would work digital
signal processing could separate the

471
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:30,020
card by modulation from the tag
modulation they're not the same volumes

472
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,830
you could keep calm and not the same
phase you could kill a man that would

473
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,779
probably work and I mention static
electricity the counter on these is

474
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:46,940
particularly bad so if you wanna
building on money it's a clamshell case

475
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:53,830
probably seen the proxy cards at a very
thick RFID tax money is designed to fit

476
00:40:53,830 --> 00:41:00,450
inside that style of case if you put it
on a flex PCB use all of the the TSSOP

477
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:06,069
parts of the 1.2 millimeters thick it
should fit so you could do that if you

478
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:11,990
wanted to approximate production costs
if you building 10 expect $100 aboard

479
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:17,870
building a thousand to go to answer
about $10 aboard a few building 10,000

480
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:23,450
including assembly building five bucks
aboard a few more than that they get

481
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:27,950
progressively cheaper but have not even
looked into how cheap you could build it

482
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:33,770
if you go real scale production house
will have any kind of problem with any

483
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:38,130
of these parts I'll be uploading a bill
of materials over files you everything

484
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:42,130
you need to get off at house with it and
there's nothing on there that will give

485
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:45,590
anyone a heartache 0603

486
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:50,880
massive components that a teeny tiny
weeny bit massive by comparison site 523

487
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,640
is det need time it's genuine small but
they don't care about them so yeah it's

488
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,660
it's very easy to take it to the house
again made component selection if you

489
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,670
gonna build it the churning caps are
very very critical you gotta use CRG

490
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,610
they give you very good thermal
stability and you've got to be related

491
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,010
to at least a hundred volts

492
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:19,680
caps answer sensitive in theory if the
device is working correctly that

493
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,100
although she never got above 10 goals so
anything higher than that will be fine

494
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:28,180
really any capacitance is fine it's it's
it's not got to do much in terms of

495
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:33,919
storing energy it's mainly just a buffer
to to smooth things out with the diodes

496
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,520
the absolutely key thing with the diet
is the recovery time so if you look at

497
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,300
the time it takes for 13.5 six megahertz
wave

498
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:50,410
charged up for half way which is on the
order of 39 seconds so if your diet has

499
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:56,259
a recovery time of 59 seconds you're
losing half of your available power so

500
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,820
you need us faster recovery time as
possible she catches much of that wave

501
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:04,700
as possible I have messed around with
really low voltage lines that shot keys

502
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,689
they work perfectly fine as well I've as
long as it's a fast recovery diode type

503
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:15,580
issue working well and got money on the
counter and counters finds check with

504
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:21,540
old age and TSSOP is good again
modulator check voltage current ratings

505
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:29,100
and the LEDs are actually there's a
couple of interesting tradeoffs there so

506
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:33,710
we need to do to choose your LEDs is the
first start off with his checking the

507
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:38,960
voltage ratings when it ships that's the
ultimate limit of you know how high

508
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,500
voltage can get and the LEDs have got to
keep it below that so let's say you can

509
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,090
imagine family that's good up to seven
balls that means you can put three and a

510
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:53,690
half maximum led and that will dictate
which colors you can use blue LEDs are

511
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:56,700
about three four faults Raiders about
1.8

512
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:03,189
there's no different colors different
other places these tradeoffs there's two

513
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:06,089
tradeoffs that you have to bear in mind
when choosing forward voltage and

514
00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:11,029
forward current ones you picked your
your your color do you want all its kind

515
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:16,310
of related to for voltage tradeoff if
you have a higher for voltage like the

516
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:23,029
three LEDs the capacity the power supply
can charge up that much further before

517
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:27,920
the LEDs turn on which means that the
high phase of any signal is that much

518
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:34,160
higher that means that government is
effective because it's generating deeper

519
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,540
modulation it's generating a better
signal if you have a low forward voltage

520
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:43,890
it means that the diodes LEDs turn on
sooner so it's more visible it's

521
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:49,779
probably a bit brighter now I chose
these these red LEDs 1.8 volts forward

522
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:54,200
voltage I chose them to be very visible
for demos and as it turns out they

523
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,270
worked fairly well

524
00:44:55,270 --> 00:45:00,509
protection as well so you do have some
flexibility actually have a guard money

525
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:05,520
at home that has pink led eyes it's it's
the cutest thing ever but you you have

526
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,750
to hit it with so much energy to make it
turn on its ridiculous like this this

527
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:18,270
high-powered to compare leader current
current on the LEDs media lights are

528
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:23,400
brighter there's more power going into
it that there's more light coming out if

529
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,180
you lower your for current then God
bernie is again more effective because

530
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:33,140
the diodes will be at the LEDs will be
shunting less power away which means

531
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:38,650
again the voltage raises rises up again
you've got deep modulation but because

532
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,869
you've got less current going through it
sent unless our way so when more power

533
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:46,690
comes in you have less ability to shun
power away and you more vulnerable to

534
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:53,940
high power killing the tackling the
money so

535
00:45:53,940 --> 00:46:00,650
to just kind of wrap up it is everyone
it's it's proven concept it's it's the

536
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:05,170
kind of thing that I don't get to see
whether it could be done and figured

537
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:10,990
that it could be done that's about where
it is it's it works as a proof of

538
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:15,598
concept device it works but in my
opinion that the weaknesses that it has

539
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,140
I couldn't in good conscience start
selling it because it's not good enough

540
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:26,140
it does work it's prove the concept it's
it's a new approach to shielding RFID

541
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,049
that I think needs to be out in the
world but I don't think it's ready

542
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:33,319
fragile commercial sale yet but it is
worthy of bringing to places like this

543
00:46:33,319 --> 00:46:38,810
and people like you and talking about it
and see if we can make it better so yeah

544
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:43,940
lots of work to do lots of help would be
appreciated and then just as a final

545
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:51,119
note taken note of this get home address
some point middle of next week I will be

546
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:57,829
posting on all of the schematics all of
the PCB layout of the gerber files the

547
00:46:57,829 --> 00:47:02,540
bill of materials the placement details

00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:39,170
thank you

551
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:56,440
shark tank this and thought of me so
this is a signal vote this was the shark

552
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:56,859
tank

553
00:47:56,859 --> 00:48:06,569
this is a sheet of RFID shielding foil
sandwiched against a myspace ultralight

554
00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:11,520
attack and the idea is that the foil
will try and block the signal and if it

555
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,960
doesn't the Mifare ultralight is
notoriously bad at playing

556
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,309
anti-collision and so the hope is that
it will stomp on the signal so it's it's

557
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:24,599
kind of similar idea but the problem
with it is you've got an RFID tag right

558
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:29,260
next to a shield so you've got two
defenses that are directly in opposition

559
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:34,260
with each other and then you've solved
the problem of protecting yourself from

560
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:40,079
RFID privacy by introducing another RFID
tag which doesn't really sound like the

561
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,869
right approach to me so I've done a
bunch of testing with this company is

562
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:49,200
actually more effective and signal holds
it provides better protection range if

563
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,098
you move it in the three primary accys
and in terms of distance from the attack

564
00:48:53,099 --> 00:49:00,180
on the reader before it reads bernie is
pretty good against signal but yeah I'm

565
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:04,129
not a fan that the city use case for
this is you have to get two of them and

566
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:08,170
sandwich them either side of your card
where is God bunnies intended you just

567
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:17,119
drop it and yes

568
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:23,539
wavelength doesn't really matter it's
it's more about dealing with em field

569
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:27,579
you know looking at radiated
electromagnetic energy you're looking at

570
00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:33,109
an oscillating magnetic field so it's
it's really the coil dimensions and the

571
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:38,380
capacitance that use it up it's one over
to frequency is one of a toupee route

572
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:55,569
I'll see just standard residents yes so
many doesn't actually care which cited a

573
00:49:55,569 --> 00:50:05,630
target on so if I put God money on top
of the tag and then put the whole mess

574
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:12,160
on the reader doesn't read I can bring
god but he slowly away and it reads

575
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,578
about here and then since I'm here just
to show you the comparison with the

576
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:31,269
single malt exactly the same test

577
00:50:31,269 --> 00:51:32,319
confuse the readers of the motion
control it it just works yes

578
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:38,860
actually created by

579
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:43,810
wasn't created Nhat but hid cells are
very similar products the idea is you

580
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:52,000
have a case where you've got the tag in
and then you've got a metal bat and then

581
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:03,080
click on the top part like this would
work very very well because then you

582
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:17,328
know not least you can guarantee the
antenna placement as well

583
00:52:17,329 --> 00:53:00,959
question the intended use case for it
was that my issue is that the moment

584
00:53:00,959 --> 00:53:04,629
RFID tags can be read without leaving
your wallet that that's not an

585
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:10,869
acceptable use case from so now you've
got the exact same use cases with any

586
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:13,959
other form of payment you have to pull
it out of your wallet give it to someone

587
00:53:13,959 --> 00:53:19,848
and i think im at a time so thank you
everyone
