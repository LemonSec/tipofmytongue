1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,830
thank you so much I love my targets were
the fissures live or alternatively

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:17,529
collecting fisher's geographical
locations that honey pots so if you are

3
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:19,420
primed and ready we will jump right in

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:25,350
so first off a little bit about myself
i'm an application security engineer Sen

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:33,510
down in Austin Texas it's my first UConn
thank you and if you're looking for me

6
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,390
you can find me one bit bucket and
smirking at Atlassian for dinner so this

7
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,120
project for started with a trend that I
was noticing on both my personal and

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:51,078
corporate domains and it was quite a bit
of foundering out you can see that India

9
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,899
mark reports as well as mail being
forced from my domains and even in light

10
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:00,410
of the better defensive frameworks like
Center policy or detail more D Marek it

11
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:06,030
was still doing out so from your answer
to developing some curiosity is some

12
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,299
fraction of the spam was sitting direct
responses as you may have seen the

13
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:14,689
trademark example would be Nigerian
prince who wants to transfer his money

14
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:20,548
over to you in the us- credibility's
curiosity about the identity of these

15
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,619
people and annexed this problem tricky
is that you can look at things like mail

16
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:29,040
headers from these messages that come in
but that doesn t couple of the identity

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,680
of the person

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,700
the identity of the person from their
operations from there from their

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,530
malicious mail server is sending out
spam so much interest in the agency

20
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,830
these people but in aggregate so their
presidents were people send personalized

21
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:55,340
responses and get replies back but it's
hard to gather that data in any sizable

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,430
sample so when about looking at some
good examples of manual correspondence

23
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,640
between sisters and on the left here is
a recent TED talk it was a comedian who

24
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,090
decided to respond to a fishing message

25
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,940
operate here we have a common idea
supplied by people who are corresponding

26
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,780
does anyone know that is behind the
mustache card Nicolas Cage you got it

27
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,280
and it's kind of a 220 pop culture so
you can see in the bottom right there is

28
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,739
actually a book written about
correspondence between people and

29
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,860
scammers so this is all well and good
but I wanted to go a little deeper and i

30
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,730
thought i think is the most vibrant and
eclectic community that deals with

31
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:44,060
things like this for 19 yrs so if you
haven't heard of this group they have

32
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,930
damned if I the act of corresponding
with spammers since you asked for it and

33
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,690
I'm not getting to you what it's time to
be alive this is part called scan

34
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,739
bidding and this isn't just something
that you do this is something something

35
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:00,709
that's been simplified and something
that you can win and the way that you

36
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:04,650
win is by corresponding with these
people and convincing them to identify

37
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,069
themselves by sending a picture of them
balancing things on their heads

38
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:15,108
and of course this this is not a
hard-and-fast rule you can see the man

39
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:20,519
second from the raid they didn't dress
up as some kind of colonial era judge or

40
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,170
something but fear not if you're
unfamiliar with this the community

41
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,980
largely support your entrance into the
sport they have a mentorship program so

42
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,819
check out the website if you don't want
to deal with that they have an ethics

43
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:37,918
you and they deal with common questions
like What if they want to talk to you on

44
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,409
the phone and the extended community
answer is you tell them that you

45
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:46,040
suffered an illness and hearing is
damaged so this kind of give me some

46
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,340
some groundwork savings to cover if I
wanted to make this into an automated

47
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,739
systems I really try to distill it down
to a few key points hehe behaviors

48
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:01,569
automate and any successful instance of
this people

49
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:07,069
responses were their disbelief that
suspended the first person narrative

50
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,089
always in the appeal to the motivations
of the sender and I'm sure all of your

51
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,879
senior fair share of this damn these
centers will talk about religious

52
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,599
motivations monetary motivations
familial strife really anything that you

53
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:23,550
see in a soap opera is fair game for
people to initiate these conversations

54
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,720
from these behaviors and I kinda mission
statement for this project became clear

55
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,349
we're looking to appeal to the ways in
this case we're looking to meet his

56
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:40,229
success is manual correspondents in some
form of system they give some semblance

57
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,210
of the quality that we see in human
responses and from this mission

58
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:51,549
statement was born so I did get the logo
I didn't splurge too much this is from

59
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,409
Fiverr

60
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:57,889
$5 and the prompt a diva graphic
designer was any pot this and technology

61
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:05,020
and this came out within 24 hours so
thank you fiber 44 legitimizing this

62
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:17,219
it was 550 after I read for the record
so primary use case here what we're

63
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,909
gonna do set up a gmail account and it
will receive messages or anything

64
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:26,330
forward then see need to print and mail
is pushed into honey fish which will

65
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,990
craft a unique response and an
accompanying and we took some motivation

66
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,500
from the marketing industry here as many
of you know a lot of marketing emails

67
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,610
will contain a one-by-one pixel image
image such that when you open the mail

68
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:46,090
the market early able to tell when you
read it the reason that we use instead

69
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,318
of an image is because you perform some
rather fingerprinting when we get from

70
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,909
one of our fisher's so if you are a
visual learner let's go to the use case

71
00:05:54,909 --> 00:06:02,240
once more we have a gmail inbox pushing
into honey fish and we have an excited

72
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,520
team of people working in mail but if
you don't have any friends you can set

73
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:12,180
up the mail to just come straight into
the inbox and that's fine do you go from

74
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:18,069
there honey fish works its magic and
crafts up a response to our fisher's

75
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:22,250
messages were sent out and some fraction
of those people in this case the guy

76
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,870
with the mustache will click through an
unofficial record the response thats

77
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:35,370
completing 100 fish so the actual
technologies Dec itself we use the

78
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:41,130
Google Ads API to push into honey fish
and fish itself is a doctor compose

79
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:47,080
system with forming containers we have
an engine X server which accepts the

80
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:54,180
mail pushes and pushes off to a flask
application and then class and send a

81
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:02,110
pic server that both takes forever to
smooth from the outgoing mail to whoever

82
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:08,400
it was that that may land in the first
place and that's record in red is as

83
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,030
soon as someone clicks through it's also
pushed into red is based on

84
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:22,570
still missing something so I told you we
need something that human responses and

85
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:34,349
Olivier answer to this is this man does
anyone who this is I told our response

86
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,930
doesn't count

87
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:42,150
another then Andrei Markov mister Markov
born June 14th 1856 and the Russian

88
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,580
Empire and his team mathematician of the
university of st. Petersburg known

89
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,640
primarily for Markov chains and a couple
of other contributions he changed his

90
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,219
facial here a few times over his
lifetime I tried to capture that you're

91
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,780
on the slide I also titled the images
into a chain that people would notice

92
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:09,349
and spark up chain over what this is
really quick and markup seen as a

93
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,080
sequence of directed graphs which may
sound boring to you but it's actually

94
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,849
pretty exciting so if you supply some
texts which were going to call an input

95
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,960
cord this it's going to choose the
starting point in that text and then

96
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,070
forum directed edges which carrier
weight and that weight is the

97
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,480
probability that we should transition
from their starting point to any other

98
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,880
words starting point so it's somewhat
randomized it's based only on the

99
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,070
current state but it also generates
pretty coherent and unique responses

100
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:44,330
because of that we had edged with a
probability so if you don't believe me

101
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:50,020
here is an example of market seems pop
culture unless we have car cause someone

102
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,900
took every word that Jon Arbuckle is
said and compiled it into a text input

103
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:00,550
corpus and it will generate Garfield
comic strips so Mark Kotsay network

104
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:06,979
similarly someone's create wine reviews
from Wine Spectator dot com as a text

105
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,690
input corpus and these markets change
her 81 reviews and I think you'll agree

106
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,190
with me this one looks pretty good like
a person might write and of course this

107
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,490
doesn't apply only to text it also
applies to things like jazz and I found

108
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,340
a couple

109
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:30,120
master's thesis is people will generate
jazz improvisations with Markov chains

110
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,280
interestingly so this is little doubt
that we're taking here so the next step

111
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,420
would be to find our own input corpus
that sucks all the boxes for us

112
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,939
responses person suspended disbelief and
inhaled a bunch of first if you take

113
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,730
nothing else away the word Corp hora
corpora is the plural of course this

114
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:57,670
free trade the trip to the Big Lebowski
that did not work it was not in first

115
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,250
person and it didn't appeal to the
motivations of fisher talks about

116
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:09,950
Germans and driving and the dude we
tried Project Gutenberg books because

117
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:14,150
those can readily available in text
format but the problem here is the most

118
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,610
of them are from the late 1800's so when
I tried it it was speaking he was

119
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,770
speaking Old English to me let's get
there and then finally there is a

120
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:28,120
website called the text file directory
Dr the DBS days nothing really funny

121
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:35,950
happened there but I had to fill the
spot in part of the slight so it was

122
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:41,930
then that I stumbled upon something
profound the holy grail of input corpora

123
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,489
for this project and that is the
personal finance subreddit

124
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:56,700
to think for a moment this is this is
really perfect its first person these

125
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,950
people have problems and successes
pretty much anything you see in a soap

126
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:05,500
opera I'm inheriting money my parents
are taking me out of the house where I

127
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,850
live I receive $3,000 it's it's really
perfect thx all of our boxes strife

128
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,860
financial burdens successes appeals to
the motivation of the center so it's

129
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,440
really great and with that we went onto
crafting a proof of concept we chose

130
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:35,070
situation five dollar-a-month droplet
block used at XYZ there is a $1 sake I

131
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:41,970
figure when these fissures read that
nothing

132
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:52,410
we registered email address under 56
self and then we created a Google

133
00:11:52,410 --> 00:12:03,560
application and then started to the
address and got pushed up our inbox

134
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:10,709
forest sign up for spam and trial the
first page results there are a lot of

135
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:16,920
nice looking websites is created with
Twitter Bootstrap so good things like

136
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:24,079
Mel B and I tried all of them and after
signing up by David a 72 hour incubation

137
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,519
period and nothing really happened it
signed up for some innocuous newsletters

138
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:39,860
and some others that I got was insulting
responses I wasn't sure the other end so

139
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:46,000
where do they go from here I went back
to my friends 19 I found a guide

140
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,339
published in 2002 the talks about this
query up here I don't know what that

141
00:12:52,339 --> 00:13:00,920
means people have this guestbook setup
