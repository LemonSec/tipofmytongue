1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,549
is everybody going to the party starts
at nine o'clock he too bad CNN and I

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:16,940
think the entrance is going to be on the
terrace level on the sample last I heard

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:25,000
what what changed if you get bad
information I'm sure they're going to

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,010
renounce it next time let's go into the
time over to roger Doiron and he's gonna

5
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:42,329
get started and tell you a little more
about Lt

6
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,950
hi everyone my name is Roger

7
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:53,399
security research scientist the security
architecture of work and I'm here to

8
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,199
talk a little bit about doing on LG
security before I started severely

9
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,940
underestimated the size of the room I
was hoping to be able to point a finger

10
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,990
at things with a laser pointer does not
really possible here so I brought

11
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,600
something even better than a laser
pointer from a mouse

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:27,899
hopefully that will allow me to double
the slides and highly I think it's my

13
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,780
first time I smoked on both as an
attendee as a speaker so i thought i

14
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:40,570
reintroduce myself thank you for joining
boomer recently I spent five years at

15
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:47,559
PG&E security research in New York and
essentially my interest I and my

16
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,060
interest

17
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,729
security of things that are quite
literally obviously because of my

18
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:58,280
previous employer I work on mobile
networks but anything that dog so while

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,479
it may mean to seem like playing with it
and you know seeing what I can find

20
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:07,520
I spoke with speaker earlier on the
wireless talk radio torn I am very

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,489
interested in talking with him because I
just looking at this new technologies

22
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:17,410
Lawrence said something very interesting
just starting but I think there anyways

23
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:23,329
I don't think that's the case with his
audience but often happens to me that

24
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,150
when I say they're working network
security people think that I working

25
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,280
things like certifications and
encryption and things like under a mile

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,670
where I'm actually working under my word
analyzing it and detecting it but that's

27
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:44,268
not like the core of my interests where
mines at least is unlike the lowest

28
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:53,230
layers of the network working physical
layer products please think I'm going to

29
00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:01,280
talk about two days later to call its
control and also completely different

30
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,730
topic would you know being offered a
different talk I'm also interested in

31
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,359
now

32
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,440
the challenges of our networks because
although nowadays everything is back at

33
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:17,020
which we are not even audi has a fully
equipped to its architecture which end

34
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:23,060
up getting a lot of problems

35
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,900
security in my opinion we were not for a
good start I was very young back then

36
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,820
but when the first generation of Milano
words was deployed the analog mobile

37
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,549
networks there was not even support for
encryption so essentially when they've

38
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,950
built mobile networks the security in
mind your honor essentially there was

39
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:53,089
not even support from adding that there
was not even like that shortly after

40
00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:00,610
that claimed the ladies will be
operational in nearly nine years I'm

41
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:06,330
pretty sure all of you guys have somehow

42
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,370
Christian was good but now it's
considered to be an old encryption

43
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,290
scheme I'm pretty sure somebody in the
audience has broken encryption on some

44
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,180
point and the main problem is that
there's no mutual authentication the

45
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,690
network authentication device with the
device has nothing to do the networks

46
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:26,750
are going to do anything against the
Kings to be stationed in 3G better

47
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,700
encryption and authentication for things
got better and healthy eating made the

48
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,200
Christian even stronger and in this
field mutual authentication so in

49
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,900
general it's wrongly assumed that the
NLD confidentiality authentication all

50
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,500
these things are kind of taking care of
and I know people that work in areas

51
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:55,750
on how to stop them from operating but
I'm going to argue to instruct that the

52
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,310
first two items I'm not really that that
bulletproof and I'll be giving details

53
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:08,590
as I go to my talk before I start of a
little bit of background for the ones to

54
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:17,239
me with these my apologies my apologies
because it may be boring but I promise

55
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,680
it's only like a couple of minutes 30
minutes by the way I i cant talk to me

56
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,070
on the short side so we can have time
for discussion at the end but I tends to

57
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,040
talk a lot of the same time I'm assuming
somebody with him when I'm running out

58
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,000
of time but I ended up very early I also
have access things I can talk about that

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,240
I left us it's alright so this kind of
like an overview and I'll t-mobile

60
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,310
Network looks like on your last you have
all the things that connect to the

61
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,200
network and used to be honest my phones
and maybe tablets now there's a lot of

62
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:57,479
things that connect from home appliances
and dads security cameras cars

63
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,860
things like ATMs a lot of different
things

64
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:11,810
regions at all portions their radio
access network which in the case of the

65
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:18,500
thousands of other buildings in the
industry in obese so when I racino begun

66
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,860
trying to go just trying to save space
station but if I say no be referring to

67
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,000
be stationed all devices and then on the
other side you have the core and the

68
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,180
packet core is essentially a bunch of a
note I'm going to go through all the

69
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:39,980
details but I don't want to take care of
what I think sticks they are sending

70
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:46,300
things to shed encryption they set up a
little bit data channel 28 area down so

71
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,700
that they can just control plane and
then at the bottom of the two gateways

72
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:56,770
as for traffic to go out to the internet
or come back into the cellular network

73
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:04,479
and just as a common here so these the
end-to-end connection between the device

74
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,560
and internet connection is keeps being
torn down and brought back it's kind of

75
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,700
like a circle and that's what I was
mentioning earlier that its network and

76
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,880
Amy and it is I will be the ones that
will be handling these secret being up

77
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,920
and down

78
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,590
LG 11 so what happens when I turn on my
phone when you come back from airplane

79
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:33,440
mode so when you come out of the subway
your phone will start doing a process

80
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,370
called the cell is essentially looks for
the primary radiation signal and

81
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:46,550
secondary synchronization signal the SSS
SSSs very hard to say and I wanted finds

82
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,460
them

83
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:52,789
synchronizing the frequency and then it
can go on and decode a child called the

84
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,560
receipts wanted to go get the ch

85
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,950
it depends Horton consideration knows
the pain within the system and then went

86
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,270
into the wrong with the system

87
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:08,270
move on and Dakota messages known as me
and safe from his blog and secondary

88
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,120
information blog and from the alley
learned everything you need to know to

89
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,820
operate in that cell and communicate and
whatnot then there's a process called

90
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:21,920
the random access trusses into used to
like to get resources assigned to the

91
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:35,010
radio layers connection and then you're
in a connected states and whenever I so

92
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:46,530
it can seem like a physical injuries and
a stream of LT on the y axis you have

93
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:52,290
frequency exciting time essentially
think of it as a great and sayings are

94
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,230
sign in different places in this group
as I mentioned earlier the first thing

95
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,930
you have to do is the BBC Channel Aldi
support for multiple then we're gonna

96
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:07,400
have 1.53 510 said that I saw it makes
sense that the first thing you need to

97
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,900
the coda our match at the center of the
spectrum so it's very easy to find a

98
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,699
challenge from their menu and then we
will see some cooler and other

99
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,450
conservation issues and then you century
learning to show you where exactly on

100
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:30,030
this other important things are our map
this again I'm not going to go through

101
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,670
all this thing with this is essentially
what happens behind the curtains when a

102
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,930
phone connects to the network there's a
bunch of handshakes you can see that

103
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,829
runs in the first one day mentioned in
this life seriously that's the first

104
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,540
mention that you do with the networks
and tension between the phone and TV

105
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,189
station and then you start talking with
notes

106
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:59,510
640 the talks with the gateways to set
up the connection and eventually at the

107
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,230
end things are set up and you can start
communicating what's important here is

108
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:09,990
that from all these things obviously all
the things that I can see where it's

109
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,430
going to be the core of what do we see
here and what can we do with these

110
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,229
things and as you can see some of these
things not just between the base station

111
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:35,530
there are things that are just some
ideas that I used to work the first way

112
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,709
is the IMEI number using Google Talk
just a thought I would drop in here it's

113
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:44,130
kind of like the serial number of this
phone is in the unique identifier for

114
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:50,220
your phone then inside your phone
simcard and that's what you thought with

115
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,900
a network to connect one not the same
card contains a secret key and a secure

116
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,939
a vehicle in Z it's a 15 digit number
and it's kind of like the Secretary on

117
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,020
the scene there should never be sure you
should always stays secret and then once

118
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,540
you connect and network assigned to you
a temporary and that the one that you

119
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,310
used to you know and then finally the
your phone number so I always think of

120
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,020
it of the interfaces in car and my phone
number

121
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,170
identified myself that's definitely not
my phone number but if somebody tells me

122
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,709
later or something

123
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:42,780
alright so that's so now I'm going to
show you a little bit of potential

124
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:49,839
experts on you know they're being held
LTE networks operate just a summary of

125
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:56,330
things are going to cover first show you
how you can see things from the base

126
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:01,290
station and you can learn a lot from the
network from that then I'll keep the

127
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,130
motivation of the core reason behind the
word I've been doing and now talk about

128
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,689
in the cultures of stingrays how to
match between these ideas I just

129
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:17,180
mentioned how I can break your phone or
your SIM card temporary break your phone

130
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:22,719
and then a new trick on how to locate
devices and how to actually follow them

131
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,310
around as long as I'm alright so if you
remember I told you that when the phone

132
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,569
turns on or like comes from airplane
mode it starts listening for first in

133
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,090
the cold

134
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:40,530
PSS channel and the SSS and then he goes
to the BBC age which is not the center

135
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:45,930
of the spectrum so I really easy for me
to just go there and recorded and you

136
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,620
can learn things from the PCH in the
first back at them you package you don't

137
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,790
learn and you learn useful things are
not that interesting you run the

138
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,839
bandwidth of the system and the
continuation of the cyclic prefix

139
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,130
something that I'm not even going to try
to explain it but it's essentially a

140
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:08,100
very likely to correct things for
equalization and and I called for a

141
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,130
multipath anyways not interesting but
then if you keep looking at these

142
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,140
messages when he learned a bandwidth of
the system you can now go to look for

143
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,030
other interesting said messages I'm
going to show the same one and two

144
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:26,920
messages but this up to 8 12345678 and
lasting from the network that are very

145
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:34,490
interesting in the first 11 message you
learn what is greater than its running

146
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:40,680
that our the MCC number to 310 that
indicates that our here in the USA and

147
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,270
the other one that I'm hiding the agency
is it tells you that our belongs to you

148
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:52,480
can tell from Verizon Sprint AT&T from
anybody you also learn the style I V

149
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,130
there some resources online that they
have big Alexa ladies and the recording

150
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:07,530
is a very interesting thing that I it's
kind of like to set up a rope Delta a

151
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:12,680
delta in terms of power that season be
stationed with Dad Delta more power and

152
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,239
the one is connected to it will tend to
think so it's kind of like giving you

153
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,570
like the continuation of how much power
should be tracked you know the most

154
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:30,350
devices you also learn things like the
consideration of all the control plane

155
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,200
tends to run the microchannel Beijing
operation using user traffic you learn a

156
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,470
lot of things and then you can go on
exploit for for example I I worked a lot

157
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,870
on now and Jenny LTE and essentially jam
Harley the run of access channel you can

158
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,810
block an entire cell with baby very low
power but for that you need to know what

159
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,670
the random access channel is but I mean
it's told you in the clear so not really

160
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:58,040
a big challenge so essentially and these
messages are necessary the phone when it

161
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,760
turns on needs to figure out how to
operate on the network

162
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,069
perhaps some of these things are not
weakness or you could just learn the

163
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,800
minimum to set up a connection make sure
that is encrypted and NSTAR you know

164
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,189
ruining the rest but I mean on the other
hand like it's an attacker wanted to

165
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,400
learn to sing that could use a
legitimate devised and like it

166
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,790
work and then somehow they can extract
information from the basement but you

167
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,060
can learn things are they selling
automotive power to set up your OB

168
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,219
station and other cool trick is that you
can learn to high-priority frequencies

169
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,570
so there's some frequencies that are
considered high priority so if your

170
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,000
phone is a base station on that
frequency it's going to just like right

171
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,690
away and so if you set up your own
decision with a frequency your chances

172
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,620
are you'll get a lot of devices
connecting to your to learn that in the

173
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,380
clear you learn a lot operator who owns
that tower in my case I was very happy

174
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,220
with my previous employer but it is
granted employer from want to do

175
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:01,470
something nasty to just hours from that
operator operator you learn that all the

176
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,890
mapping from the ceiling channels and
the page entitled operations you learn a

177
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:10,630
lot of things that I sent in the clear
so now let's see how we can exploit

178
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:16,490
these things so first of all what I
showed you earlier what happens in the

179
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,430
background when your phone connects to
the network this is what you see between

180
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:23,599
the phone and the base station on how
you guys can see these you can see it

181
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,050
well but essentially I'm going to go
through the whole thing but with my

182
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,630
mouse here whenever you see something
like the shade that's a blank and why'd

183
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:37,270
you steal you and these problems and
during these are the messages and every

184
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,770
column like it's it's on the top is not
only important whatever economies but

185
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,300
essentially these other messages that I
can sniff in between the phone and the

186
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,990
base station and the weekend is run by
sistema handshake

187
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,220
resource control handshake then a bunch
of logistics authenticated whatever an

188
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,580
idea in your traffic is encrypted and
protected so I can have their key point

189
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,460
here is that there's a bunch of things
before you actually the authentication

190
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:10,130
encryption that I send a clear
protective so I can I can I can I guess

191
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,500
I can pretend to be stationed in my car
that had him with a

192
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,589
allies and as many other things that are
saying the clear there's a measurement

193
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:22,149
reports of the phone sends periodically
on the list of towers its season their

194
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,900
power they received from the towers are
sending a clear and you can potentially

195
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,800
use them to you know pinpoint the
location recent you can see the seller's

196
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:39,280
it sees that went to discuss actually
notice that sometimes you can trigger

197
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,960
for me to send a message and encrypted
that tells you the GPS coordinates of us

198
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,640
all kind of bad hand over radio messages
paging messages a ton of things are

199
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,320
representing the clear so essentially
these main takeaway want you guys to you

200
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,419
know i mean message I want to try to be
there although the wrong assumption that

201
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:05,110
LT's more secure than GSM and 3G which
it is ideal for false assumption that

202
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:11,530
you cannot setup but regardless of fault
indication and like fancy Krypton

203
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:17,560
whatever any of your phones that can
talk ot will exchange a substantial

204
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:24,770
number of messages with any way station
and I'll TV station Kroger not that

205
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,510
advertises itself with the right
information and that right information

206
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,420
is what I just showed you how to sneak
in the clear from just taking passive

207
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:38,730
captures so let's see how we can exploit
this some of the things that you can use

208
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,309
the bottom you have my personal

209
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:48,999
i use a usb 210 like people have arisen
see what the budget policies are you

210
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:53,350
have the budget or what I'm using I also
it's good to have that GPS thing for you

211
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,649
as a pinnacle need to have the clock
very accurate if you're doing time her

212
00:18:56,649 --> 00:19:03,219
ulti I think it's like 30 something many
samples per second and I usable into an

213
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:12,970
open source implementation of a few
years ago it was not that many but now

214
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,629
this few of them and they are very very
good might make the most open Ltd is an

215
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:29,639
end-to-end additionally you can actually
have a Skype call from your and there's

216
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:33,789
another one that I like a lot I think
you have the potential for like teaching

217
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:38,549
these kind of things because it's based
on the radio companion as opposed to fly

218
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:44,269
coating everything you're covering this
nice image processing system open air

219
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:48,809
interfaces industry construction design
is very very good and then one that I'm

220
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:55,700
very excited SRS Lt because this one now
has a vision of Aug sites you can start

221
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,269
doing testing methods against the base
station I just don't have a way station

222
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:05,279
I can try things legally sell and i felt
betrayed use unless I get one myself but

223
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,400
I'm excited

224
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:17,610
and obviously some experiments used
should value must be part of a case just

225
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:28,050
to comply with regulations recently jobs
century had to restart my desert from

226
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,129
scratch so many other captured showing
here I've been working with these

227
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:37,550
companies within the past few days a
tool to capture traffic I'll do you

228
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:43,940
think of it as the on steroids allows
you to capture the physical layer and

229
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:51,430
like an oscillator and soul essentially
thank you so much

230
00:20:51,430 --> 00:21:00,080
here options for things like a pickup
truck done to me but you can use it to

231
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,679
like cities analyzing traffic why she
has an LTR still never guided tour if

232
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,890
anybody has this come talk to me you
have to like write your own filters so

233
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,730
you can like brothers to pick up

234
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:19,930
script used only the cold one message at
a time which is a very useful and then

235
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:24,850
there's a little consortium foundational
it was that you can use for our culture

236
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:34,310
to mention is that again this did you
guys are running the country's but it's

237
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:41,270
essentially a tool that he'll study
which is supposed to be a secret from

238
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,060
your phone this is used

239
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:50,450
law enforcement somethings to attract
people they're looking like concerns

240
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:56,850
about privacy I personally and that's my
personal opinion but whatever but

241
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:07,100
essentially all I want to say is that
you can have your Realty essentially a

242
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:12,490
way to know who you are if it has never
seen you so if you have just bought a

243
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,430
phone you turn on for the first time

244
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,550
doesn't know who you are and there's no
teams established yet so you have the

245
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:25,710
same so although it should be kept
secret is always at least once in the

246
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,000
clear so you want to clear when the base
station claims that he claims that he

247
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,820
has never seen you but it's kind of like
intuitive to understand that this is

248
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,909
going to this is going to happen before
you authenticate with you know who you

249
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:39,270
are

250
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:44,460
authenticate so essentially the message
of handshaking which the base station

251
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:52,120
legally or like to change that I should
send you for authentication trucks on so

252
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,850
you can spot open for example that's how
I did you modify the code and you have

253
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,980
it as a little Broadway station people
were attached to you they will tell you

254
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,000
that requires he just like to do it in
such a way that they send you the names

255
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,820
in the new just reject so they just want
to go back to a roller derby station and

256
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,909
then I V DS

257
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:30,870
century it's essentially what happened
way though these I'm capturing the

258
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:35,500
attached request message to a clean the
reversing the device so in that message

259
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:45,420
in the clear you can see the demise of
uncovering the secrets to learning but

260
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:50,510
that's what happened and then the whole
reason is because since the attached

261
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,510
request message is a plane message
without without without any security

262
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:04,629
encryption or integrated with other
things like tracking users on this later

263
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,880
it's always interesting to match between
like say you wanna see where a person

264
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,600
you have this phone number what a person
is so you always when I met my between

265
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,590
the phone number and the teams and then
there's been other work on the son of

266
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:23,560
this before but since beating messages
are sent in the clear if i send a text

267
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,310
message to a friend and we think the
same area if I see a paging message I

268
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:32,760
know that my friend somewhere in the
area so what you can do nothing between

269
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,020
the phone number and the team's he is a
former colleague of mine had tricked

270
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,510
sending more storm text messages the
trigger anything on the member of you

271
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,260
see the paging you see the phone getting
the message but then the message your

272
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,150
phone or something along the ridge from
like someone and then it just discovered

273
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,760
so therefore never break your triggering
this thing on the network so you can

274
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:59,170
continue to messages within two minutes
ms James is getting the messages and

275
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,500
then within the EU

276
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,020
usually when you set up a railway
station the phone twice first with a

277
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:10,129
team they are you can do it in such a
way that Chrysler the team's A&M is a

278
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,680
couple of other cool tricks on a lot to
talk about

279
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:18,970
from a paper that was very recently
released just another capture as I said

280
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,400
to beijing messages are sent in the
clear

281
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:27,840
paging messages should have essentially
whenever there's an incoming connection

282
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,139
for your phone say a cold X and the data
flow and your phone is in idle mode the

283
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,720
network knows where you are roughly so I
know how the tracking area I'll be there

284
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,800
in the sea but I always leave the
example i working example there were no

285
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:51,220
you're somewhere but not exactly where
you r celebrate our in every sense a

286
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:59,020
paging message saying here and then my
phone and hear these messages are saying

287
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,570
the clear so that's how I can see also
the person is actually here and I can

288
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:10,760
start by being between the phone number
and all right before I continue I want

289
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,490
to talk a lot of people that was
recently so it turns out that there's a

290
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:22,470
group clean and other places in Helsinki
and others that are working in very

291
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:29,150
similar things and they got a pepper
accepted and yes even if he's going to

292
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:34,780
India says I should go see attention
because there's a lot of overlapping

293
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:40,910
with the things I like to present so I
thought I might as well acknowledged so

294
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:48,430
when i SAT there people there were three
prints online so I want to share when I

295
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:53,600
say they are the first ones ever release
any multi-protocol exploits

296
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,590
they have a trick to this location and
like triggering like silent teachings by

297
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:07,010
doing so would you use what somebody's
message on the screen you see that a

298
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,450
person is typing

299
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,890
growth that's happening and your phone
is being paged and they have another

300
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:20,230
trick where they send so I for some type
of Facebook message that goes to show

301
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,330
you are not even aware that you're
getting the message alert on the phone

302
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:29,730
so there's no way to like silently did
your phone then like to try this team I

303
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,700
i'm familiar with the world of you
following them since 2010 and these

304
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:39,350
things make sure why the people were day
but essentially if they are in the same

305
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:43,730
areas you standing me Tonys and
somebody's calling me and I'm on GSM

306
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,570
the Interceptor Beijing message for my
phone and reply to it they can answer

307
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,220
the call

308
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,470
receive a text message that of me but
just work with just him and they say

309
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,549
that they have a washout guilty they
sector either hearing me on super insane

310
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:01,340
that very excited they say that the
community is going to emerge with

311
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,879
application at some point alright so I'm
talking about that I'm going to show you

312
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,030
a cool thing that I found so it turns
out this week and block or break your

313
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:19,020
phone or your or your single temporary
though so essentially when you try to

314
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,590
connect they showed you earlier this
message that they were tries to connect

315
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,139
you to your raga station so

316
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:32,530
it's a real be stationed at this point
and then at this point you will not be

317
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:36,420
able to pass the test you will never be
able to do a man in the middle of the

318
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:41,070
connection so for them to catch in my
case what I was doing and I just sent an

319
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,710
adult reject but it turns out during the
attached reject or in the tracking area

320
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:50,180
did reject message there's a cost code
reason why you're rejecting and you can

321
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:56,100
tell things and the fallout is like so
it's like a little bit like I think I

322
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,590
trick so the phone tries to connect to
your robie station and you actually

323
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:09,149
because you're not allowed to connect to
your operator anymore

324
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:15,430
ok sure and then the phone stops trying
to connect to a network so essentially

325
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:26,160
the phone is plugged it doesn't like the
ones I knew that it was not like a like

326
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:31,840
us breaking up the phone and I you seem
to be open I'll teeth as a function that

327
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,470
does not be for you and then I just a
little bit but I essentially just

328
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:40,770
different causes a reason code that you
can play with but there's one on the

329
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,560
phone it's your turn the phone you're
not allowed to connect to to MCC MNC

330
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,540
called network

331
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,990
ok and doesn't try to connect anymore

332
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,940
result is that the phone and the same
are unblocked

333
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,650
only temporary but their blog there is
no way the phone won't connect to a

334
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:04,620
network but deceive you reboot your
phone or if you toggle airplane mode

335
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:10,510
that the phone works again be tricky
with likes a machine to machine Internet

336
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,960
of Things do you have a bunch of the
basis somewhere in the field and USB

337
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,940
blog all of them like that then

338
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,190
no problem because you cannot just go
there like send technician to all of

339
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:27,980
them are like to toggle airplane mode I
spoke with apparently there's a time in

340
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:34,100
the network is called 230 245 the time
of your phone has been told no you're

341
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,689
not allowed to connect to a network
anymore after this time expires you are

342
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:45,130
allowed again to try the time 24 to 48
hours or so it's a long so if this new

343
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,560
least 100 mile to use in the field I
mean it's not clear what you can do

344
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:54,669
maybe you can probably not because it's
not going to do a network technician to

345
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:59,610
like you know just wait 48 hours until
your system is online again I guess

346
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:13,429
would be bad but whatever happens in the
fall but the next triggers actually even

347
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:22,660
more interesting story to tell the phone
that actually the phone is only allowed

348
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:31,830
to conduct a GSM network and you replied
to the OK from that moment on your phone

349
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:39,149
will only talk system and I'm pretty
sure what happens with GSM like then you

350
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:43,780
can you can like brute force encryption
breezy remote table is likely terabytes

351
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,000
you can just look at the session key and
cloning SIM card and then essentially

352
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,480
you can listen to calls free text
messages you can form a long list of

353
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,120
things so I think that this is even
scarier than the previous one so you can

354
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,110
accentuate you instruct the phone to go
down to Jason European authenticated

355
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:08,330
telephone just go to the super insecure
and i won the fight like the right

356
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:15,600
happens and then finally talked about
another thing that I played with

357
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:23,769
tracking devices I mentioned earlier
about using paging messages and other

358
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:28,840
tricks to pinpoint the location of the
device these are also have a pretty good

359
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:34,199
way to do so for more background but
will be very quick so I'm going to be

360
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,820
talking about these vehicles are indiaia
it stands for radio network temporary

361
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,559
cease-fire that I don't know what it's
used for us but I do know that it's

362
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,399
sending to clear in every single message
no matter what it is always in the head

363
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:57,879
of your messages always sending a clear
device a phone with being a cell in the

364
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,549
sense that if you know that your phone
in the cell where you are now it's our

365
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:06,889
indiaia one that doesn't mean there
could be another phone with AT&T and

366
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:14,019
some of the self so I just it's just for
one individual cell i've seen changing

367
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:18,899
rather infrequently although it's
supposed to change sometimes and I

368
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:22,250
haven't seen anything sexual behavior
for these fade away from any operators

369
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,789
like mostly all the things I'm
presenting or not will you tired

370
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:28,639
whenever is like a century like optical
coatings are defining the and the

371
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:34,549
protocols and disease assigned to the
phone at the first handshake at the

372
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:39,789
running backs this procedure I mentioned
earlier called random access responds

373
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:46,360
and that is where our assigned you may
be asked you a captured this message as

374
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,178
I mentioned earlier way before us
indications are you saying the clear and

375
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:55,789
you can see that when I tried to get a
sign in the tier then so when I was

376
00:33:55,789 --> 00:34:00,139
working with these I was always trying
to recapture in a place with a lot of

377
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:03,949
people it's very very hard to
distinguish your phones traffic from the

378
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:09,399
rest I was trying with like teens it
seems like a long numbers like 15 digit

379
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:11,929
and then when they realize

380
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:18,139
started using I realized I started using
that to like no one was my my device you

381
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,220
could you know you can call early
capture based on the value of something

382
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:33,290
and it's always an entire you know the
details are given for a given person

383
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:36,829
then you will see you will have to trust
me because it might be encrypted but you

384
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:45,139
will see every single message uplink and
downlink person so I mean it's not a

385
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:52,190
huge deal but I can so it's doing them
the mapping between your phone number of

386
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:57,490
teams and I truly like an exam mentioned
earlier and then I can know for how long

387
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:04,558
some of you guys stay here from ABC as
long as I know that you're here you're

388
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:10,329
not home and I cannot override or
something and i think is that you can

389
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:17,200
estimate the uplink and downlink traffic
load so assuming that control plane

390
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,598
traffic is much less than the traffic
because you cannot distinguish between

391
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,849
them you can be made to know what is
being said this could be potentially

392
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:33,200
interesting indicator of an LTE base at
home at work or dislike hotspot the

393
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,359
right talks with because then you can
tell what's the hot spot maybe you want

394
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:45,380
to try to general something that I found
the worst kind of like my most

395
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,670
interesting discovery regarding these
are indeed I think

396
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:57,960
I spoke with the GOP and I'm actually
I'm sending this for them shortly and

397
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,710
I'm actively involved in fixing all
these things are getting them and they

398
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,510
told me that this should not happen
anyway I did something a few times I

399
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,710
thought it was interesting to share with
you guys so here we have to have one

400
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,470
device that is going to be heading over
between oneself from one tower tonight

401
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:21,270
our you can see here the columnist IV is
going to sell a 360 and then it's going

402
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:37,569
to have to sell a 50 alright and then
the way it works is that the reports

403
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:42,640
saying I see these towers and I see that
we received our and then based on these

404
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,250
measurements that does not work decide
whether you should stay put or maybe

405
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,609
hand over to another tower as I
mentioned these messages are sent in the

406
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,619
clear and then you could use them to
pinpoint location but in this case is

407
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:59,990
not important but anyways these messages
and here I cash example of a cultural

408
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:06,279
alright so in this case this message

409
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,099
triggers and I would like we should get
these guys to hand over power so then

410
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:15,780
still on so sixty I received this
message that I seen the clear although

411
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,579
it should be sent encrypted

412
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:27,720
instructing the phone ok you have now to
move to another tower so obviously our

413
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,390
is going to connect but the most
interesting thing that I found is that

414
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:37,950
the network is giving the phone new
identity by the way you our job on

415
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:45,368
standby user equipment it's the way you
are assured of anybody's quick here

416
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:54,940
doing hex translation but 2012 wait for
it and essentially what's happening is

417
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:59,410
and how are you telling me what's going
to be on the next cell so I want to

418
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,589
follow you in our earlier know where
you're going to know what's going to be

419
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:11,049
the next follow you on one cell to
another one said it was interesting it

420
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:14,670
gets tricky then because then you lose
their run of access to Syria you can see

421
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:21,030
here with other cell and the right
message you get a signed some other

422
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:28,040
rental so this probably because it's
locally with with the tower but then

423
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,540
once you finish the connection this
message

424
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,900
cold there are seeking reconsideration
then the network does general but like

425
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:48,540
the member you actually have to use it
and then I just continue to work with as

426
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:53,980
much as I caught the standard of public
documents posted on the internet there

427
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:59,180
like nine hundred pages long age 19
October but I did my best and I just

428
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:04,009
learned things like is indeed a unique
identifier used only at the physical

429
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:08,780
layer after you establish a connection

430
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,220
the one that you're giving the beginning
these temporary becomes the actual when

431
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:19,299
are you going to be using and enjoying
end over end I was explicitly telling

432
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:25,220
you what's going to be ready at the next
caller but there's no specific

433
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:31,000
guidelines on how to refresh their
indiaia couldn't find anything that

434
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,960
tells you should refresh as much as
possible and also I think I found his

435
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,569
dad and pressure must be like an hour
isn't generated but especially when

436
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:45,079
whenever there's a new user entering at
our the sale signs it the last rnds I'm

437
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:51,609
plus one which makes your search ads
that message with a new way then did you

438
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:54,240
know that it's going to be from the last
rnds saying

439
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,500
it's going to be just a few more because
it just sounds sequential so I mean

440
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:04,260
there's some potential solutions you
could you should refresh indiaia each

441
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,990
time the phone goes between either
unconnected essentially should refresh

442
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:13,540
it as much as you can because especially
when the phone in either mode and go

443
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:19,160
back to connect it does arrive and gets
an R&D I the problem is that then it

444
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,430
just like switches back to the one you
had before so it will be good to like

445
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,970
you know refreshing as much as possible
randomized it when you assign one nurse

446
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:35,319
and the last one point one and the fact
that indicate the following saw in the

447
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,610
message should be kind of investigators
I don't think it maybe there's a reason

448
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:49,560
for that but that's what allows us to
track you refreshed frequently this

449
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,390
paper last year actually know very well
what are the answers it's a very cool

450
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:57,600
paper I really recommend that the
building a system to the ulti analytics

451
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,210
based on software radio and it's
recalling the code or I think

452
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:09,080
essentially a very small section I'm not
sure they were aware of the potential of

453
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,759
that section of the paper but they came
up with this thing they also realize

454
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,000
that the easiest way to track user is
using MPI and they would have liked

455
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,600
measurement and track the traffic and
they want to but they know is that

456
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,640
something you don't change what they
make physical measurements using

457
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,770
multiple antennas and so they see where
the signal comes from what intensity of

458
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:37,380
the scene like dead driver signature for
the following and then even if the NCAA

459
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:42,480
10 jurors then they see anywhere near
the Hutchinson before embracing

460
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,690
signature so they can tell it's the same

461
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,680
user and they are getting right i think
im ninety-something percent of the time

462
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:59,140
so even if a baby might be able to the
fifties but even if these guys came up

463
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:05,680
with a way to continue tracking and i'm
looking very very interesting and I

464
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,649
recently discuss these things we've
suggested they told me at this message

465
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:15,770
is expressly told you the idea Nextel
should be an encrypted which would make

466
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:22,580
things more difficult but you could
steal you know monitor traffic from I

467
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,270
just installed after all the report of
the user you can see in the key you know

468
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,960
what sells its seeing and you know what
sells it seemed the most power so you

469
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,740
know what are the cells that it's likely
going to hand over you can you could

470
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,359
keep an eye on those and then used to
trigger just explain to keep tracking

471
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,660
device but I'm going to have ongoing
discussions with them and will

472
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:47,100
investigate these and see what can be
done and just to rub I just have some

473
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,950
final thoughts on how late earlier but
hopefully those questions and the things

474
00:42:51,950 --> 00:43:00,890
we talked about very active since 2009
but most cause things until now have

475
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:05,410
been only cuz it was you know available
open sores and what are people doing

476
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:10,589
cool stuff especially was open source
unavailable but now and then I mean

477
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:16,380
things but this was a very interesting
paper on how to locate people in DSM

478
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,530
using the paging messages has a few
years ago

479
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:26,370
castaneda broke the crypto for GSM
remember because I had just started

480
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:32,069
working in the field of security and I
saw talking about a dozen ways you can

481
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:35,890
like a connection there was a cool
project and black hot Carmen Sandiego

482
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:40,910
where they were many connections and and
and

483
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:46,620
but now with the recent availability of
the expected now to be a lot of people

484
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,290
working on

485
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:52,250
that's why wasn't I dot super surprised
that somebody was talking about these

486
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:56,240
things and they realize that people
expect a surge in these areas a lot of

487
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,080
open source I encourage you guys to play
with it and like doing with you know the

488
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:06,060
right mindset break things but kind of
like the aim is to like 6 a.m. and I

489
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,600
think it could be a very interesting
topic if there's any grass when are here

490
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,270
the tools are open source and you can
play an interesting things and the more

491
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,550
we work in this area the more you know
the more secure networks will be so

492
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:24,870
having said that this is all my house I
get out early early unless I can talk a

493
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:42,910
little things i'm happy to take
questions yes

494
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:53,339
so you mean the question is if I can
guarantee I so I can pretend to be the

495
00:44:53,339 --> 00:45:01,759
next hour I'm going to technically yes
so there's ways in which you can

496
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,549
telephone you should go to the store and
then you pretend we are doing just like

497
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:09,509
how do you receive the connection so you
could potentially something like that

498
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:16,369
the problem is that then there will be
two towers at about the same place with

499
00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:20,920
the same I V with the same everything so
who is also may be re- exactly what will

500
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:41,690
happen but yeah you can experiment with
ya

501
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:49,680
tried changing the NTIA of my eyes to in
connection because you cannot really

502
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,649
because these are things that happen to
be the man so unless you are gonna break

503
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:58,410
into the vehicle and you can do all
things that only outside of my area of

504
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:04,470
expertise kind of OJ tying things and
doing things that something we could try

505
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:11,839
but I haven't tried it because it's not
something you can do from the userspace

506
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,470
simple if you're obviously really
concerned about this what would happen

507
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:21,129
if you just you know put your phone in
airplane every couple of hours or took

508
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:25,080
the New York City Subway on the ground
outside of outside of out of reception

509
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:31,400
what will happen you know what will
happen to the phone would attach again

510
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,960
with a net worth of the different yeah
like it's likely that it will happen

511
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,880
like that yet so that could be a trick I
am personally and is like my personal

512
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,590
opinion and I'm not too concerned about
people following me a tracking with

513
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:50,750
mandii because after all I'm nobody's
12345 go ahead but but yeah if you are

514
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:55,110
really concerned about that you could
like total between modem back on that

515
00:46:55,110 --> 00:47:01,590
and you would probably thanks by the way
are you going to be online I see they

516
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:11,770
will and I'm going to some kind of like
a report and proceedings so yeah I do

517
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:14,850
you need the GPS party were kid to do
LTE

518
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:26,700
collection the GPS part of your kid no
but I would suggest that if you don't

519
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:31,819
have it you do some things that are
narrow band till all the things I say

520
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,700
the broadcast information from the base
stations that's easily sending the

521
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,870
central South Korea so you want to
consider here started like 1.5 or 3 a.m.

522
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:44,150
because then the number of samples per
second the media's much lower it should

523
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,990
be able to take it much easier

524
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:55,910
ok no computer for the board just tried
to play with a lower bandwidth

525
00:47:55,910 --> 00:48:01,730
consideration way to work if you set up
a base station we've been with 1.5 your

526
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:06,200
phone to connect with just less
bandwidth is less room for user data

527
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:17,009
throughput is going to be much lower but
I so you mentioned that as a device's

528
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:23,130
towers the losing tower provides aren ti
for the gaming tower what happens if

529
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:28,540
there's a collision on R&D eyes are
beginning terrell how does the losing

530
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:35,220
Darren oh yeah that's a good question so
obviously but the reason why they can

531
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,779
announce what's going to be on da the
next two hours because those who may

532
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:44,840
stations are like talking in the
background they cornered work for this

533
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,010
you can put it in my slides but
sometimes is an awesome design

534
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:51,670
industries like connection between base
stations themselves without talking with

535
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:55,210
the corner were on his way to base
stations that are adjacent to each other

536
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:59,190
they can like talk in the background ok
I'm about to send your guide is the new

537
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,810
R&D I etcetera etcetera

538
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:04,900
so now there's no risk of having a
collision but yeah that's a good

539
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:11,180
question that lingers Asian that happens
on the back all is that a symmetric or

540
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:16,160
asymmetric in the sense that you know
many stations are joining a tower at one

541
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,660
time so there's a chance that the losing
terror would get a communication that

542
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:25,009
and ideas available beginning tower yeah
and then a new advice during the games

543
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:31,609
are a lot of devices in one hour then
I'm going to hand over to the next hour

544
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:35,700
and they are all doing it at the same
time obviously there will be a race

545
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:41,279
condition so that they could be the
chances that you end up having the same

546
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:48,770
and ES cells are not zero although not
on thinking about it for all overly the

547
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:56,079
network kind of like sends a message for
you to switch away and then let him go

548
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,880
ahead until it's done with the other
ones so I have a good answer the

549
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,280
question is it will be a very very
extreme race condition very very

550
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,780
unlikely to happen but I mean is there
any benefits of forcing two devices to

551
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,369
having conflicting colliding

552
00:50:12,369 --> 00:50:21,859
ID's and probably seem to get confused
today to be stationed in many devices or

553
00:50:21,859 --> 00:50:27,339
like the same idea but I don't know what
happened as i said i I cannot claim that

554
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:30,430
the probability of that happening is you
know but at the same time i can claim

555
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:31,859
that it's very unlikely to happen

556
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:41,259
make it a lot of the handshake messages
in clear and I'm is this was wondering

557
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:45,339
if there's rationale behind not
selecting an encryption scheme before

558
00:50:45,339 --> 00:50:50,490
the hand that's a good question so once
again with a network and you set up the

559
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:54,229
encryption everything does proceed to
keep encryptions being used for the

560
00:50:54,230 --> 00:51:00,010
contraband messages so many of them are
encrypted from my conversations I'm just

561
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:06,990
amazed this message that I excelled at
one should be encrypted

562
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:13,189
implementation issues I'm not sure but
yeah in general one i can assume they're

563
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:19,880
warning me all the time but I couldn't
just let me know

564
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:28,250
so there's the ones you're connected a
lot of the things that you said in terms

565
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:33,950
of my country are encrypted just add
some others are not

566
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:38,250
okay thank you very much
