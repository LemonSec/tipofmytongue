1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,050
and only

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:01:18,408
ok around talk that one cannot be safely
through mutual funds

3
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:54,409
but but also tech for a while but then
realized that humans are also machines

4
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:59,929
and show she's very interested in the
role and how you how you manipulate and

5
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:14,480
program the human-machine in the system
so it without any further ado

6
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:32,019
there is nobody so hi welcome to our
talk users are people to usability for

7
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:36,730
hackers 101 I'm just Andrews just to say
hi or both of the organization simply

8
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,459
secure which is focused on usability for
open source tools for encryption and I

9
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,099
have also been an organizer of hackers
on planet earth conference and event on

10
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:49,129
the radio show off the hook but today
unless you're a hacker had more here's

11
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:53,390
my usability huts and I want to make the
case that when you decide to develop a

12
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,608
new piece of open source software who
was doing that some points open source

13
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,680
software yesterday ok cool heads who
thinks they might like to do that at

14
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,840
some point

15
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:15,110
couple ppl ok good thing we need to meet
some of those I was not a slide

16
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,930
going over there

17
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:33,230
not anymore we made such we made a lot
of slides ya know we don't need a GUI

18
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:39,750
why we need to go we will just work like
an outline

19
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:49,650
that's cool I can start with this one
without having side there so as I said

20
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,300
tonight would like to make the case you
that when you develop a new piece of

21
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,140
open source software particularly an
application for security you want to

22
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,660
begin by understanding the needs of the
people who use the software software

23
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,150
doesn't in the hackers infect
communities are not completely in the

24
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,300
dark about the impact of human factors
right like we think about social

25
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,980
engineering we think about shoulder
surfing within about passwords on post

26
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,120
it stuck to the monitor right so all of
those involved the social factors so we

27
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,489
need these are doing little to
translation between social engineering

28
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:22,400
and human factors those end up being
kind of the same thing but they're not

29
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,060
entirely or log onto each other because
only thinking of human factors as attack

30
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,460
vectors basically thinking about social
engineering that will not ensure that

31
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,359
your software gets used properly or
necessarily at all you have to consider

32
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,120
whether the security tools for
developing match the social systems are

33
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,289
operating in and this would be
particularly useful

34
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:53,240
envision envision a container with a lid
is locked by a padlock a combination

35
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,759
lock and it says on it

36
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,710
code to lock with a narrow and the code
to open the lock yes right so we have a

37
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:09,419
door and the things to tell us the
password on the monitor scenario White

38
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:30,399
Russians God o'donnell's are you want to
get off so I just said when you have

39
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,580
something for some reason the password
next to the thing that they're trying to

40
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,859
unlock with the case indicated or what
might be happening is there are a number

41
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,409
of people who need access to the door
and they need to do so infrequent

42
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:48,089
memorizing the password is not
necessarily all that useful ignoring the

43
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:51,939
reason it did you get a post-it note
next to the door or a password written

44
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:55,930
next to the door is because human
factors have not been taken into account

45
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,580
users will be simply do whatever they
need to do in order to get their work

46
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:08,188
done and that may mean circumventing
your system in someone now envision

47
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:16,559
slide of Glenn Greenwald scratching his
head and with the day 2013 above and the

48
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:23,939
the caption encryption Peter aka pain in
the ass raped so that's there we go and

49
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:28,529
now we can you give me a little bland
let me try and get it up

50
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:34,219
ok so the reason we're saying this is
you know what may be at stake in your

51
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:35,390
usability and maybe

52
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,969
you say the next whistleblowers ability
to speak out or the safety of a

53
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,010
journalist in vietnam or conceivably
somebody looking to leave an abusive

54
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,270
relationship you need to use a security
tool to protect themselves against it is

55
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,280
very close to them so you may remember
that Glenn Greenwald initially ignored

56
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,919
requests that he talked to using
encrypted mail because he figured it was

57
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,410
too hard right now in hindsight this
might likely to silly decisions that was

58
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,020
kind of one of the biggest stories in
recent years but greenwald like all of

59
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,570
us was working in a complex system of
daily demands it one that you should not

60
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,170
underestimate it may be a social system
our computer system but it is still a

61
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,700
complex system so he was working under
the cultural pressures of journalism

62
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,240
with tight deadlines and he's so it's
the last thing about what he was going

63
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,690
through he'd probably been approached by
any number of nutjobs were like I have

64
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:27,440
such a big league for you people
whatever but he doesn't he's not gonna

65
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,600
listen to them so you don't have
balancing all of these hearings that he

66
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,620
is personal cost benefit analysis was
initially it wasn't worth taking the

67
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,210
time to learn to which frankly is really
freaking hard to use right like if

68
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:45,700
you've tried to use CD or DVD tools in
an email it's kind of a minor thing is

69
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,099
you know he didn't have an incentive for
other sources other sources were not

70
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,430
exactly clamoring to get him to exchange
keys with him so what usability and

71
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,470
design teacher is the importance of
respecting these complex social systems

72
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:04,450
in which people are using your software
and user research is not a laboratory

73
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,159
science ok that's one of the key things
here we normally think of science we

74
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,880
think like you know you take it eleven
you weed out all the noise and things

75
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,290
like that but if you try to weird out
we're looking to weed out we're looking

76
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,170
at factors as noise or outliers will
actually lose the data that you're

77
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,030
looking for

78
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,859
so we're gonna make a case for why you
should be doing social or human factors

79
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,900
research envision if you will

80
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:39,809
next so how many got to dr. dependent on
stage right next slide right so it's a

81
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:43,309
procedure like I said we work primarily
with open source encryption tools and

82
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:47,099
one of the big problems that we see with
his open source encryption tools is the

83
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,130
way they get user feedback and so one of
the problems is actually when they get

84
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,140
user feedback they tend to shoot first
ask questions later they like about the

85
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,140
software now tell us what you think best
practices in human factors say go talk

86
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,180
to users first figure out what they need
and then develop something I would

87
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,770
really like those of you who haven't
developed tools yet to think about that

88
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,350
glass the user's first the second thing
that a lot of open source tools are

89
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,150
doing that is problematic is the main
channels for feedback so mailing lists

90
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:19,750
like the one that asked people to sign
up for IRC and get up there all highly

91
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,339
technical systems require a huge amount
of personal investment part of the user

92
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:28,260
you have to look through some sort of
Germany stuff and then you're gonna get

93
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,029
the message all the time and you also
have to figure out the culture of like

94
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,290
you know you're gonna speak up and say I
need help with some people will be like

95
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,270
RTFM and that's you know not
particularly welcoming and not great for

96
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:49,160
end users who may be less confident
their abilities so like I said also

97
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,400
require you to add a lot of tools and
also a lot of a lot of RTFM calls and

98
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,430
these high barriers to entry make it so
you repeatedly hear from like particular

99
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,199
people mostly that one guy who is home
brewed your software to run you know in

100
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,160
CyanogenMod on his respirator pie and
now he has all of the needs because he

101
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,420
is you know he's done the special number
thing you already know you don't want to

102
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,150
help that guy he's causing his own
problems right so do yourself a favor

103
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,640
and go find other ways to listen to
feedback gonna talk a little bit about

104
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:24,209
how you can do that ok

105
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:30,410
ok so what is the solution to this
hacker problem that you all have humans

106
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,199
they are hard one answer is
human-centered design what is human

107
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:40,170
centered design human-centered design is
basically a way to develop empathy and

108
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,649
insight into actual real human beings
something to remember

109
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:49,029
yes you all are real human beings but
you are not typical human beings unless

110
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:52,740
you are building a tool for people who
look exactly like you and operate

111
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,910
exactly like you how many of you have
had the experience where you build

112
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,589
something and you had a fine time using
it but someone else had a hard time

113
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:00,759
using it

114
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:05,759
yeah exactly human-centered design and
research is all about helping you get

115
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,429
through that get over that problem

116
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:13,439
find a way to develop empathy designed
for users needs and actually evaluate

117
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:18,610
your tool with them in place this is
something that any hacker can do

118
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:25,420
ok so sup 101 lesson 101 whenever you're
trying to deal with a new culture or in

119
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,868
new environments is not to take your
assumptions your knowledge to it and

120
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:34,990
expect them to adapt to you but instead
to adapt to your understanding of the

121
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:40,149
new culture including of their
terminology so one term in a bit of

122
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:45,089
terminology that you're familiar with is
user interfaces a user interface is the

123
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:49,059
stuff that you put on a screen that a
person interacts with it can be a

124
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:52,610
command-line theoretically although not
recommended if you're looking for people

125
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,779
other than yourself to use it can be a
GUI it can have buttons that can have

126
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:58,639
pictures

127
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,339
anything that the user sees or interact
with it is possible to critique the

128
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:08,610
interface but it is important to note
that the interface alone is not the most

129
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,360
important element in usability so if you
are talking to someone who deals with

130
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,610
usability ordeals a design remember
interface is not what's important strike

131
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,130
the word interface from your core
vocabulary and instead focus on

132
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:28,510
on user experience right so user
experience is more than just the

133
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,470
interface so here I am sort of
suggesting some possible stops on the

134
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,140
tour user interface when you're looking
for tour and getting it installed on

135
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:41,080
your phone could ensue could include the
new user flow and installing the first

136
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,840
time could include searching in a
browser finding

137
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,260
com which is actually about science
fiction looking in the Google Play Store

138
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,830
finding multiple things at the same name
making sense of a whole ton of

139
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,420
permissions requests realizing that you
have a piece missing basically telling

140
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,270
you to go back to the Google Play Store
and install a different app that you

141
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,770
didn't know you also needed getting a
security warning you to understand tells

142
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,579
you that tourism safe and going to
another website not to critique tour but

143
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,790
the wonderful thing is that the tour
team has gone ok in addition to this is

144
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,730
also a number of technical problems in
the background that are causing new user

145
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,300
drop off and a devoted a lot of time to
understanding where they're just using

146
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,579
massive numbers of potential new users
other parts of the user experience later

147
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,160
on the flow include lagging
troubleshooting suspending asking for

148
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,680
help

149
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,079
sharing customizing thinking and
uninstalling so this is like these are

150
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,490
all behaviors and experiences they're
not just the things that you can click

151
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,880
on the addition to the the dichotomy
between just a plane interface and the

152
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,870
actual holistic experience that your
users have with your sake we can talk

153
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,220
about usability and so what is usability

154
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,730
think you forgot that we've got to
computers going so usability is well

155
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:59,410
let's look at this fall 00 hate its
high-quality car right nice parts

156
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:06,709
reliable very very safe will get you
where you need to go it is usable is it

157
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,860
really something that brings you joy is
it gonna be something that brings you

158
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,990
joy like this does this is another high
quality European car this is the

159
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,810
difference between usability which
doesn't allow you to get the job done

160
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,680
and I

161
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,029
and design which is something that
brings you joy 1 terminology that one

162
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:33,170
bit of terminology that members of the
the computer science community are

163
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,329
familiar with is elegance you can have a
piece of code that is functional and

164
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,660
that sort of the parallel to usability
but is your code elegant is an elegant

165
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:51,329
solution that is what we talk about when
something is well designed that we can

166
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,779
tell you about the study of user
experience beyond these sort of simple

167
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:59,020
terms the thing that I want you to walk
away from is that the study of user

168
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,230
experience and design the human-centered
mess of work is a large very well

169
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,630
developed field that has all sorts of
techniques and approaches and things

170
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:13,339
that people use every day to make the
user experience of software better now

171
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,620
we don't necessarily expect you to be
able to dive right in and do these

172
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,459
things however because you know
unparalleled I like to draw you know we

173
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:26,390
don't expect user experience designers
to do quick to implement crypto

174
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,959
protocols so it's not necessarily fair
to ask cryptographer zand technologists

175
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,459
to do usability and design right off the
bat so we're here to help you figure out

176
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:42,000
a scrappy path to do that ok so
human-centered design usability and

177
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,589
design for hackers this is the ideal
flow if you have a tool that you are

178
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,850
have not written yet but you plan to
write these are the steps that you

179
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,230
should ideally go through in order to
make sure that you're truly meets the

180
00:15:54,230 --> 00:16:00,300
needs of your users however you are
probably are in a slightly different

181
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,790
situation you know you're you're not
very well-equipped to start from scratch

182
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,130
you have a tool that you've already been
working on for you know maybe ten years

183
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,970
twenty years five years however long you
can establish codebase you have limited

184
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,100
amount of time

185
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,110
I'm you don't necessarily have easy
access to your users your users may be

186
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,290
in China or wherever they happen to be
you might not speak their language

187
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:28,449
necessarily you are not aux professional
by treating you don't necessarily know

188
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:32,889
what questions to ask and also an
interesting challenge that this

189
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:36,459
community has that many of the big tech
companies don't have is that you care

190
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:41,339
about the privacy of our users hopefully
so unlike a big tech company you can't

191
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,449
just track their every move when they're
interacting with your web interface and

192
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:48,479
mine it for data and interesting
insights because you want to make sure

193
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,519
that you are collecting a minimum of
information about your users because you

194
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,740
know that that is a value that is
something that they value in your actual

195
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,819
ok what can you actually do this is what
we're here to actually tell you about

196
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:08,158
today this is a process that you can use
to day with your software to try and

197
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:12,120
improve your total gain insight into how
to make it better and actually help your

198
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:20,479
real users ok so getting to know your
users and their genes the first thing

199
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,159
you need to do is define the population
you're trying to reach and this needs to

200
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:28,179
be a detailed definition that goes
beyond just demographics because secure

201
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:31,880
is only secure in reference to a threat
model as we know right

202
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,460
usable is only usable similarly in
reference to a particular user in

203
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,130
specific circumstances and its
importance or think about the difference

204
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,240
between threat models use cases and
software features is also slightly

205
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,419
different things so threat models are
prioritized sets of threats that

206
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:51,940
particular user faces most people in the
community know that while use cases are

207
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,870
ways in which particular users would
like to address the needs they have in

208
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,928
the real world and that may include but
are not limited to threats or maybe like

209
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:03,990
I need to take care of my child you know
on a day-to-day basis but then also you

210
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,330
know

211
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:10,030
activists and then protect myself police
features are not really either of those

212
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:14,970
heaters are set of functionality that
when combined address those use cases so

213
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,440
thats to think of Moses

214
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,090
report abuse cases are a part that can
help use cases and features address

215
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:25,020
these cases the city of identified you
like your security tool to support gay

216
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:33,280
activists in Russia Russia because of
the exporting of hatred are at high risk

217
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,690
of physical attack not to mention at
risk of losing their jobs because people

218
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:43,650
were shouting them or being arrested so
that's the right one use case might be

219
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:48,690
the ability to notify people when they
are arrested so they want to do that in

220
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,690
a way that the police will notice right
then I noticed that the police announced

221
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,570
that the phone with her phone in some
way

222
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:58,350
know that this is not the feature itself
this is actually the use case and the

223
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,159
features might meet this use case in one
of a couple of different ways so for

224
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,940
example maybe you think you can meet
this need with a panic button like the

225
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,420
one shown over on the right that's
developed by Amnesty International sir

226
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,460
panic button up and that button will
alert the contacts friends their

227
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,230
whereabouts given the use case might be
that they're targeted by a thug in the

228
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,140
middle there or police officer who might
not only take their phone and used to

229
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,670
target their friends but also Mike
physically attacked them while doing so

230
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,080
the future should be designed
specifically for that Yusuke so you're

231
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,120
not gonna looking for like a tiny button
that's very deep in a bunch of menus

232
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,879
that possible bunch of are you sure are
you absolutely sure that you want to

233
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,260
save yourself from the situation so they
need to be able to get fast with one

234
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,710
hand and then defend themselves with the
other hand right so and it also possibly

235
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:50,430
should also hide the Apple is going
further in addition to use cases you

236
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,570
want to get a sense of the world that
users live in and the systems that

237
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,970
they're interacting with I highly
recommend reading this book or if you

238
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,520
feel like you can't read something that
is the compendium of all research on how

239
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,780
technological innovation propagates you
can read cliff's notes which is called

240
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,340
the tipping point he basically stole
that from this book so a little bit more

241
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,139
readable but I actually recommend this
one has a lot of really good sites in it

242
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,790
so questions from this

243
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,700
are expected at first and who adopt
later not everybody's going to adopt

244
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,690
right away right but not every Twitter
right away you know you have your early

245
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,590
doctors and you later doctors one of the
ways people pick things up is by

246
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,439
observing other people how will people
observe your initial users using that

247
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,100
tool so they decided something that they
can use their needs a fundamental

248
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,350
conflict between your tool and local
cultural norms this is a massive

249
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,990
challenge for us in open source
encryption tools because most people in

250
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,360
the open source community think that a
lot of the sharing that we do like our

251
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,240
GPS coordinates and our friend network
and things like that are a bad idea but

252
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,620
unfortunately that forces left the barn
right like you know the cultural norm

253
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,219
now is sure absolutely everything
including a picture of your credit card

254
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,100
on social media right so how are you
going to design given that that is the

255
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,250
system you're working in and you can't
necessarily make an immediate change do

256
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,440
it how easy enjoyable helping helpful
and satisfying is it compared to tools

257
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,750
they normally use remember that for
example each new setup screen at the

258
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:24,850
likelihood that they will stop
installing your tool ok so once you have

259
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,879
gotten to know your users you don't want
to take the two of them right away part

260
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,180
of developing usability expertise is
learning yourself to think through the

261
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,200
tall your tool in through the lens of
somebody else's use case and not just

262
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,500
the uses that you want to put the tool
to so experts use our way to do this

263
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,640
that consists of somebody skilled in
user experience experience thinking

264
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,070
going through common expected workflows
for the two like setting up for the

265
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,800
first time and trying to put themselves
in the shoes of the user makes sense to

266
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,550
do this before you put in front of the
user because otherwise there just might

267
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,760
panic and be like this test was terrible
I'm never gonna touch this is very scary

268
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,920
it's very important to have somebody who
did not write the to look at it so you

269
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,970
may write the tool but you know signed a
designer a researcher for some fun in

270
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:15,030
person has done a lot of work with user
experience to take a look at all so one

271
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,200
way that you can go through an expert
view

272
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,899
is using heuristics very easy to find
these are the groups Yahoo

273
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:28,969
usability heuristics these are basically
guidelines and use them by walking

274
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,529
through the workflow the task that the
users who identified are likely to want

275
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:37,279
to do and then check that each of these
guidelines is met at each step there are

276
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:39,960
sort of like Greater and Lesser

277
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,120
some of them have fewer points that you
have to go through but this is sort of

278
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,268
the gold standard in a lot of ways so
for example thinking through number nine

279
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:53,130
giving error feedback to users error
logs are very useful for you right you

280
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,630
know when you when something crashes you
can go through and find out exactly

281
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:00,710
where in the stack happens but an
application doesn't really meet you at

282
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,940
nine for the use case of an activist
cause they're not gonna be able to go

283
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,419
through the entire error log while
they're they're trying to fend off the

284
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:11,880
police right so you know they need
something that comes up faster obviously

285
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,850
some sort of quick era words in this all
sort of my cell number six recognition

286
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,779
vs recall somebody has to go digging
through an application to find out what

287
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:22,950
went wrong but also really doesn't meet
the need for like finding out something

288
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:29,289
quickly so that puts a lot of burden on
the memories the user recognition memory

289
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:33,269
so consider if you're going to virtual
that you've already built what does your

290
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:37,700
software currently do to help users
recover from errors

291
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:45,320
ok so step one was understand your users
that too or at least talk to them try

292
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,700
and get a sense of who your users really
are beyond you step 2 was an expert if

293
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,149
you have someone who is not you who has
not built the tool who have lee has more

294
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:59,139
experience the new doing usability
thinking and designed they can look at

295
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:04,490
the tool in a systematic way to identify
sort of low-hanging fruit problems

296
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:11,440
step three is interview really users now
by real users it's important to me and

297
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,720
again those people that you identified
in step 1 as your target users you can't

298
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,730
just go to your buddy Jim and be like
hey Jim I know that you love encryption

299
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,370
as much as I do

300
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,870
tell me what you think of my tools like
it's really great except can you make

301
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:30,239
more advanced features because users
only smart more advanced features guess

302
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,590
what

303
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,020
average users really don't they want a
better initially used case experience

304
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:40,120
they want even finding help ensure they
run into trouble things like that so

305
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,300
what you do is you get real people and
you sit down and you talk about them and

306
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,850
one thing that this would do is it will
give you insights into who users are and

307
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,199
what their real needs are and it will
also help you understand how the

308
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:00,530
software works for them now that a
number one tip so so one question I have

309
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:06,280
real quick how do you find users well
one way is how do you find friends so

310
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,840
anytime you meet new people you can be
like hey by the way I know this is kind

311
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,240
of lame but would you be willing to look
at this with me for five minutes you can

312
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,090
go to a coffee shop and be like have a
little free coffee for people who will

313
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,540
look at my software you can do it as I
once did when I was working in a big

314
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:28,070
tech company and go to the company store
and hang out in interview people who

315
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,189
happen to walk in

316
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,870
funny anecdote I accidentally used a
member of a black eyed peas in a user

317
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,889
study once doing that just sort of crap
only walking rapidly walking into

318
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:43,670
someplace and trying to ask them about
what they thought about myself now one

319
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:51,150
pro tip here is when you are talking to
users the whole point is to listen i

320
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,360
must say this again because you're gonna
hear it and you're gonna say yes of

321
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,860
course I do that but really I mean it
the whole point is to listen to the user

322
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:05,620
do not educate them do not try and teach
them do not they already know just just

323
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,219
click here in here in here in here and
then you're good because the whole point

324
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:14,320
of the exercise is to see where they run
into trouble at put some duct tape on

325
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,290
your mouth if you have to actually watch
and see what they do see what challenges

326
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:24,990
they have this above all else listening
and watching to a human being who has

327
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,780
never used your software before using it
will teach you more about the usability

328
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,690
and design

329
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:34,940
of your user experience than anything
else we can tell you I'm just realizing

330
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,000
this is where I should have put my slide
of the kitten in a doll house because

331
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,649
the thing that I've really enjoyed that
user testing is basically like what are

332
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:44,239
you doing baby guinea pigs you take them
to put them in the doghouse and they

333
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,899
just rackets and that's the fun of user
testing has gotten into sort of like the

334
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,639
kittens in the doghouse you're like oh I
thought that was a window but I guess it

335
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:58,100
or you gotta learn to enjoy watching
things break right like that's a lot of

336
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,850
fun so what we're just doing interviews
and you're not actually walking through

337
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:08,350
the interface so you want to make sure
that your answer if you're asking

338
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:12,459
questions in an open-ended way to say
how do you often do I encounter blocked

339
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,529
websites you assuming that people do
encounter block websites but when asked

340
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:20,639
them in more open way so for example do
you think your blog from getting to what

341
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:25,549
some websites asking a very general way
you can ask open questions like talk to

342
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:28,259
us about how you interact with
technology in the course of your average

343
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:31,809
day like that may not be the question
for every study but if you really

344
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:34,740
looking for some sort of general stuff
in a way to break the ice like that

345
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:40,500
might be a little bit better than sort
of going to you encrypt right you heard

346
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,690
about that and amusing terrorists use it
so or fuel for example another good

347
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,990
open-ended question what are your
concerns about who sees your information

348
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,159
online jargon jargon must leave your
questions

349
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,639
believe it or not this includes words
like HTTP right like so once again don't

350
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:02,340
say things like HP like it a lot of
things we take for granted

351
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,840
URL like I wish people knew the word URL
because it's really fundamental to

352
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,740
understanding and didn't get it

353
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:14,080
censorship don't see censorship if
you're talking to anybody from China if

354
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,928
they buy into the system in China was
talking to a guy from South China are we

355
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:21,000
gonna party like I work on tools that
help a sister ship literally walked

356
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,890
across the room didn't want to be seen

357
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,910
with me so you know consider what it is
that what are the words that people

358
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,800
would use themselves understand their
surroundings and what things they can't

359
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,629
say you can't think about you know
another key thing is asking personal

360
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,950
questions at the end not the beginning
you can introduce stereotype threat if

361
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,120
you are somebody like what their
ethnicity or gender is the beginning

362
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,919
they may go like oh I'm being judged for
that purpose and it makes people very

363
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,420
nervous or asking about their income
also just set up a block ask those kind

364
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,600
of questions to ask them off like you
might need to know you know to meet a

365
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,389
certain user requirement like how many
people are particular geographic area

366
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:02,910
ok so after you've done interviews what
do you do next

367
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,830
user stories among other things so you
want to build a model of users and their

368
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,270
needs and there's some very high a sort
of detailed ways to do it no detailed

369
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:15,560
ways user stories or less detailed way
this is a great example Twitter feed cat

370
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,750
user stories as a cat I want to have to
lay out so they could have something to

371
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:26,110
tap small items offer as Annex I want to
why so I can see right so that's like

372
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,389
the sort of most fundamental unit of
like a story that you can tell about

373
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,520
what your user once a picture you know
can help you really sort of identified

374
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,120
with this person I can't believe I found
this picture this is the absolute best

375
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,620
picture for that's why did not
originally go together a more detailed

376
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:45,270
way of doing us is coming up with
personas now talk a little bit about

377
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:50,040
Christmas just briefly then the whole
point of developing a model you know

378
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,180
it's really hard to remember who your
users are while you're going through the

379
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,870
software development and design process
so the idea of a user model is something

380
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,020
that you can put up on your whiteboard
that you can you know hang up in your

381
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,970
office somewhere like oh right I need to
remember Jim Jim really like to knock

382
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,560
stuff off tables I need to design for
gym and also Kate etcetera that's the

383
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,800
idea of a user model sort of a shorthand
to help you remember your Username so

384
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,180
you can put something like that like
literally take this kitten putting up a

385
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,710
wall too great picture so as soon as a
little bit more details and help you

386
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,410
remember things once again this also is
useful if you know you can't go back to

387
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,920
use multiple times so you're going to
tibet once and you meet people there you

388
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,750
come up with a more detailed description

389
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:36,380
of what their needs are and so then you
can go back to the person you can be

390
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,110
like ok right D mostly use mobile tools
they're worried about this thing with

391
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,870
police probable whatever the person is
that I'm describing here I hope that you

392
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:50,169
are all under the table header these are
all open source file free to use and so

393
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:54,400
please this is this is part of a project
we did to my previous employer to

394
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,830
develop for some of those first trilogy
BTQ communities but then more generally

395
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:03,750
for journalists and human rights workers
and other people who may have security

396
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:08,340
concerns also better choices to choose a
major case that we think about a lot of

397
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,439
thinking about security let's dive a
little bit deeper this is a really

398
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:18,370
detailed almost a little bit deeper into
what percentage are not right so those

399
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,909
are not actual people write the sort of
an amalgam of various people for both

400
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:26,000
privacy reasons and for the sake of
really meeting a bunch of needs they're

401
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,390
not stereotypes so don't go in and you
know don't apply stereotypes that idea

402
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,440
that none of the like oh my grandma
can't do this this is the grandma

403
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,030
persona no not detailed enough like I
was really good actually

404
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,680
their task based they're not just
demographics are you thinking about

405
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,330
things that are actually people are
actually doing so these ones here

406
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:51,149
actually can see them doing this right
so this is one batch of the information

407
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,640
you'd see in these personas and this is
the demographic stuff so if you were

408
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,100
only doing qualitative study or about
things that you can sort of measuring

409
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:03,240
count you end up like this one guy is it
2009 to college students about gay

410
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,890
they're going to use mobile social media
status but they don't change the privacy

411
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,980
settings one wants to communicate to
community needs to find a community

412
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,820
right there are relatively similar needs
but if you do a more detailed

413
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:21,030
qualitative analysis of these two
personas that we've built a two part of

414
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:25,550
the person is that we in the deck that I
have you find they're very different so

415
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:31,120
the first cases the use case once again
and again in russia he generally has the

416
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,030
need to be known because he needs to
organize community and be trusted by his

417
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,770
community is some

418
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:40,730
who can sort of like make sure that
actions happen and they're effective so

419
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:46,120
he blogs under a pseudonym his petition
online groups but he's out in his real

420
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,239
identity is revealed then you know thugs
me find him the police make arrest him

421
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,610
so he needs to have it this is really
interesting quandary for the specific

422
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,800
case of he needs to remain anonymous but
also be well-known so how can your tool

423
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,800
support a person who does that second
one this comes from a guy who worked on

424
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:08,000
his persona with us you actually helps
get fundamentalist get gay teens out of

425
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,680
very fundamentalist Christian Bob Jones
University where if they're found out at

426
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,300
school they're likely to be kicked out
of their family and kicked out of school

427
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:21,639
and they literally have no place to go
and so whereas the other guy is more

428
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,850
likely to face physical threats joseph
has more likely to just sort of lose

429
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:31,689
everything he has and just end up
homeless and threats he faces a much

430
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:36,700
more intimate his family like many
families in that community have a lot of

431
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,590
any software on your computer into the
following their kids that way she's not

432
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,679
from not been out and about for a while
so he doesn't know terms like

433
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,480
trans-gender he may not even know the
term straight so he doesn't know what

434
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,900
he's looking for how do you support
somebody has your up support somebody

435
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,480
who doesn't even know what they're
looking for you so yes these are two

436
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,180
very different cases and it's important
to sort of make up personas that are

437
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,770
really separate based on needs that
maybe even in conflict with each other

438
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:10,350
particular point in time so ok so I
mentioned you know that these user

439
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:15,370
models whether their personas user
stories or some other type of model are

440
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,918
useful to keep up on your whiteboard to
constantly be asking yourself am i

441
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:22,649
meeting jim's need am i meeting Mary's
mean am i meeting fucked in months needs

442
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:26,940
another way that you can sort of have
constant reminders of whether you're

443
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,139
meeting your users needs is by making
sure that you have a good way for users

444
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:37,759
to give you feedback by the way pro tip
get how does not count as a good way to

445
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,030
get user feedback you need once again to
have a mechanism a path a channel to get

446
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,980
feedback from people who are your target
users so if you're trying to users are

447
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:53,510
all hackers just like you said you'd get
use whatever you know crazy esoteric IRC

448
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,240
you know very into your you're looking
to use but if you want real people to

449
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,259
help you you need to have maybe a
mailing list or an email address or a

450
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:09,670
forum on your website or even better a
place within your interface where users

451
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:15,020
can submit feedback and you know making
sure that you have this feedback coming

452
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,390
in the you actually have a live human
being who is going through and

453
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:23,460
monitoring it and looking at it there
are tools out there that will help you

454
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,020
cluster feedback that will help you sort
of aggregate the information that you're

455
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:32,410
getting from your users can help you
track for example top 10 user complaints

456
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:35,359
what our top 10 user complaints this
month

457
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,910
you know because it's really easy to get
lost in the weeds say oh I heard from

458
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:44,310
you know this one person they really
care a lot about this one issue how many

459
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,380
people are complaining about it is it
one person whose company about it very

460
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,600
loudly on all of the different forums or
is it really actually a variety of

461
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,710
people it's just another way to sort of
get the pulse of what your users

462
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:02,180
experiences like using your software and
finally with all of these signals with

463
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,410
all this information about your users
with all of the new ability that you

464
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:11,250
have to try and improve your software
you gotta hurry this is not a one-off

465
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:16,820
process you can't just sort of have it
be one-and-done where did my user study

466
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,190
and I made sure that I get feedback and
I i looked at my feedback for a month

467
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:24,680
and therefore our software is good
because just as your software evolves so

468
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,839
do the needs of your users and you need
to continuously be thinking about using

469
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,940
your user experience and continuously
thinking about the usability of your

470
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,860
tool in order to make it continuously
relevant for the people that you wanted

471
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,530
to be used by and one thing I want to
know

472
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,570
going back to the fusion of innovations
one thing to say that you should do is

473
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,380
going looking to see whether your tools
being repurposed in some ways so Scott

474
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,110
pointed out to me that the amnesty
International panic button that we found

475
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,870
earlier is actually being used by
midwestern families for their kids they

476
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:57,650
just did this app and then basically if
somebody like snatches them off the

477
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,030
street they can just press that button
on their families through so they that

478
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,680
is a different use cases in this worth
going back and forth going ok so now we

479
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,560
know we have this other user base what
is it that they needed how can we

480
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,520
support them as well

481
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,940
ok so we told ourselves we've got you
know sort of war stories and lessons in

482
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:21,250
general but we told ourselves that we
were going to cut to our conclusions if

483
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,940
we were 10 minutes away to make sure
that we have plenty of time to talk to

484
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:28,850
you all and answer your questions and
have a good conversation so I'm going to

485
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,529
skip through some very tantalizing
pictures to get to the conclusions but

486
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,310
if you don't have many questions yes
that that is a pony if you don't have

487
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:40,920
any questions we can certainly come back
to this war stories and Dustin I would

488
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,080
be happy to talk to you about them after
it as well

489
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:57,610
ok so in conclusion and I'm like this
you can read you don't need me to tell

490
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,270
you it says on the side

491
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:05,860
users are hard you almost have you were
not trained to think about users you are

492
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,220
not trained to think about the user
experience remember not interface the

493
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,700
user experience of the software that you
are building and this stuff is heart

494
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,270
we've tried to outline a process here
that is scrappy and that we think anyone

495
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:23,030
can do but it takes real work and this
is something that you have to think of

496
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:27,750
developing expertise in just like you
have worked so hard to develop expertise

497
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,480
in all of the

498
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,260
other areas of your professional life so
if you want help that's kind of what we

499
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:34,770
do

500
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,670
simply secures designed as an
organization to help people working in

501
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,700
the open source community particularly
on security and privacy tools to help

502
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,490
you make your tools more usable and
useful for real people we currently have

503
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:52,000
a program available through the open
Technology Fund where you can actually

504
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,380
get free professional help for your
tools you know right now it's a little

505
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,160
bit limited focus on the stuff that the
open Technology Fund works fine but

506
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,290
please get in touch if you want help we
can have a 10 minute discussion where we

507
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:15,810
can like talk her into a mini expert
review yeah yeah we are a non-profit and

508
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:21,060
so did it simply secure are
tax-deductible we're trying to expand

509
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,910
our reach and trying to to make what we
do available to all people so we're

510
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:30,180
resource but there are lots of other
good resources online here are a few and

511
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:36,710
we are now ready to take your questions
and comments

512
00:39:36,710 --> 00:40:09,260
Allen cooper's the inmates are running
the asylum of the book recommendation

513
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:30,620
friends don't let friends and everyone
is what do we do with the elite version

514
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:37,660
of course with three not ease so what do
you do with it when people who are

515
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:43,790
building the tools don't seem to care
about their users well on one level exit

516
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,740
its open-source fork the project and
make it better

517
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,799
like you know if you care about the tool
and the people who are the owners of it

518
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,950
or not you know being responsive like
you can submit patches you can do seven

519
00:40:54,950 --> 00:41:00,569
that's the open-source answer the other
answer is collect user stories if you

520
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,600
can find a couple of this is more than
anything the most convincing way to get

521
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,000
people to care about users take it you
can find someone who's willing to let

522
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,530
you video them using the product using
the tool go through and try and use it

523
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:20,330
for the first time the developers will
be pulling their hair out and you have

524
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,610
to say well actually no guess what

525
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:27,230
nine-tenths of people that I talk to
have this problem so yeah I mean if you

526
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:31,350
are building a tool just for you and
your friends well I don't know that we

527
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:34,900
can really counter that but if they have
any modicum of interest in having anyone

528
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,120
other than them and their friends use it
a little bit of

529
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,089
sort of pain inflicted on them showing
them just how difficult it is for real

530
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:47,200
humans to use it can be very effective I
should say also technology that we did

531
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,319
have and I wanted to counter thing I
said earlier that's mostly because

532
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,190
they're losing funding and so that's the
reason I wanted to not because they're

533
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,050
bad but because there are three
different projects involved there and

534
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:00,540
all of them are sort of the risk but we
had an animal developer meet in June at

535
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,240
Freedom Festival which is coming up
again in March last year he met with a

536
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,580
bunch of people from the least I'm from
South American places like that and got

537
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:13,730
to hear their stories and he came away
going I have had more useful user

538
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,320
feedback in the past five days that I
haven't had five years on our mailing

539
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,800
list so sometimes really just meeting
people are not necessarily talking about

540
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,110
the software software needs just like
going and getting to know them can

541
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,480
really be motivating like actually
getting to know the journalists or

542
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:33,970
whoever like getting invested in their
costs

543
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:40,939
just

544
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,560
hypothesis excessive sleepiness is not
the issue the issue is not enough UX

545
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,670
people involved in security tools that
is what another thing that we're trying

546
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:54,090
to do as an organization so if you know
you X people who are interested in this

547
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:59,609
space or you have a young UX cousin or
whatever like it you wanna like converts

548
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:00,410
to the cause

549
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:03,080
let us know we've got a program that
we're trying to start up to like get

550
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,150
them involved

551
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:08,619
pay them actual dollars to work on these
projects build their expertise we have

552
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:19,640
more professional UX people make it a
whole of little yes that's an

553
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,000
interesting challenge that the usability
for novices versus the usability for

554
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,050
experts problem that is a real challenge
it's something that a lot of us in the

555
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:32,670
tech community experienced frustration
with the big tech companies products

556
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:37,609
because there's this trend in many cases
to sort of pear you know hideaway or

557
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:43,540
even remove the advanced functionality
in favor of making the novice experience

558
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:48,869
smooth and seamless I think the answer
is that it's a really know your users

559
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:52,869
kind of problem so you need to know who
your users are you need to have a sense

560
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:58,230
of what you know how important is it to
the tool that the novice experience be

561
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:02,960
seamless imperfect vs how important is
it for the actual users that we care

562
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,320
about to have it be more advanced I
think that the the ultimate answer is

563
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:12,760
make the advanced stuff available at
readily available but maybe not make

564
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,480
sure that it doesn't get in the way of
the novices if that answers your

565
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,130
question it's a heart problem

566
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:37,490
community and the internet freedoms
community in the Internet freedom

567
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:41,319
community that works on awareness
particularly for folks who are under

568
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:47,759
threat in repressive regimes things like
that I think that it is a hard problem

569
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:52,430
it's not something that we particularly
are focused on I think that the idea of

570
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:58,740
it you know sort of our approach is make
the tools better and make it so anyone

571
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,339
can use the tools and then you don't
have to be an expert to use the tools

572
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:06,000
and then you can recommend it to your
cousin and the evangelism can happen

573
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,309
more organically within the social
communities that are takes us to stake

574
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:14,380
out actually two particular
organizations that do this work yet

575
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,359
we've got a minute short textile
technology is the one that first comes

576
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,869
to mind they're quite good news is also
doing training with a handful of

577
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:25,359
organizations level up is a curriculum
helping trainers understand what adult

578
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:44,330
learners need to use level dash up dot
dots easy

579
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:55,830
don't fix the user's fix the tools that
our approach and I believe we are at a

580
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,620
time so I think our Yahoo
