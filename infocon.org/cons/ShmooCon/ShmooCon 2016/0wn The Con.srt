1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,849
there's a lot of lag do you need to that
can help now I ask Mike Weir good you

2
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:19,980
ready now I welcome tonic on this is the
11th year that we've done this talk we

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,930
didn't do the first year i think is
weird you freaked out trying to actually

4
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:29,710
run the card to talk about the gun I
would always use different slides right

5
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:37,649
now we have a new graph of its people so
called you grab the way you work at the

6
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,430
pentagon in the seventies didn't you

7
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:47,289
yes that's a pretty much yet so we've
been doing this for eleven years now and

8
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,370
it was a little bit different

9
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,480
is we kind of went over some of the
material we normally cover in the

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,239
opening this year but we still want to
cover a fair bit of it the same type of

11
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,608
stuff here in Nakhon with more details
of the hard numbers around finances

12
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:05,409
around attendees routes emissions and
that kind of thing and part of this is

13
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:10,180
for you all hear a part of this is also
for people in the future that may want

14
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,740
to run their own events and you know
what I like how much is it safe to

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,380
Roadrunner conference what I really
expect from submissions all that kind of

16
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,798
thing so that other people can take what
we've done in and do even better so but

17
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,130
I think as we've already covered some of
this in in the opening will bomb through

18
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,479
a few pieces material here a little
faster normally don't take a lot of

19
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,579
questions during this part but if you do
have questions I think will entertain

20
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:42,939
them as we go so questions ok so
organizational structure is not a

21
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:47,309
non-profit mostly those nonprofits are a
giant pain in the ass anyone here

22
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,979
involved and Industry Ministry nonprofit
is this something you enjoy doing now

23
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,119
head shakes yeah okay we are you may be
a little different on every minute of it

24
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,390
in my pocket I think

25
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,869
so we run it as an LLC support proper
authorization we don't try to make any

26
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,040
money on it and it works out pretty well
it keeps things simpler from a tax

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,750
perspective we don't have to have any
meetings and minutes and that kind of

28
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,170
thing

29
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,489
LLC requirements to exist are pretty
lights he paid a state every once in

30
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,060
awhile you filed your forms and it's a
piece of cake I would encourage anyone

31
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,550
can start your own company just go
online pay somebody a hundred bucks plus

32
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,340
whatever filing fees and have them do it
because it's amazingly fast in some

33
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,830
states instantaneous now write some
states actually have electronic filing

34
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,450
for the LOC and you're also you can be
legal

35
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,170
like as soon as you hit submit I think
in maryland they still actually have to

36
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,829
have someone physically take the piece
of paper down to the Statehouse in

37
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:53,180
Baltimore because 1880 almost everything
we do is done via email and phone calls

38
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,370
I know a lot of other conference
organizers have IRC channels and and all

39
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,540
kinds of different communication
mechanisms we still basically just use

40
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,350
email and found we don't have regular
you know monthly stand-up meetings

41
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,130
writing like that it's it's pretty
casual pretty informal other rate of

42
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,500
said phone calls and emails obviously
increases dramatically as we get closer

43
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,660
to the con but we don't need a lot of
pomp and circumstance around

44
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,269
communications we run much mailing list
that deal with these two different

45
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,049
sectors so you know we've got labs we've
got a V

46
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,790
sponsors Press request a like kind of
thing and that's all just mail aliases

47
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,010
nothing more complicated I would press
paying us and they say hey how do I get

48
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,399
to breastfeed say go to this web page
it's kind of information email to the

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,370
press requests and we take it from there

50
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,090
you know the simple things like that not
complicated at all other web forms

51
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,570
nothing to work with so then we will
start writing this on Monday but a large

52
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,880
part where we start doing on monday is
the stuff that Todd runs for us which

53
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,859
has gotten a lot of feedback and kind of
distilling it and I we analyze that with

54
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,440
the real planning starts in earnest
usually in the end of summer time once

55
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,790
we've had a chance to not do this for a
while and remember what we would do it

56
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:11,858
staff jumping on in this are you sure
I'm so I just started talking which is

57
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:12,750
kinda my nature

58
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:21,418
ok let me go back there about 80
volunteers give or take it its

59
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,969
volunteers kind of loosely defined with
volunteers here wearing the blue shirts

60
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,270
and staffers also people are kinda
household do stuff the bags and roll

61
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,758
t-shirts do we have that in to talk
about that in here

62
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:40,750
bag stuffing and shirt t-shirt rolling I
got food so you know when you come to

63
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,740
registration registration was that right

64
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:50,849
like that was not always crazy fast I
was trying to like talk to people about

65
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:53,849
what to do with your bad you know like
walk backwards as I was talking to

66
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:58,530
people could before walking through the
line so goddamn quickly and the reason

67
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,479
as fast as an awful lot of preparation
goes into making registration possible

68
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,550
so there's two big free conference
events that we have and we actually host

69
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:14,780
Opera House each year versus t-shirt
rolling so you know it's a giant pain

70
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,880
the ass addicted or laundry to find one
pair of socks or whatever you're looking

71
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,760
for

72
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,830
imagine a box it's full of teachers at
all look identical except a little tag

73
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,580
that has different sizes right we
learned that lesson early so we sorted

74
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,930
by size we roll up it will be some paper
and with Roma box so that we can sort of

75
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,490
into those wire racks we come down to
the conference it takes awhile takes a

76
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,750
few hours ago through a couple thousand
shirts sorted by size do all the rolling

77
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,090
at the same time will sick people on
upgrading computers and you know

78
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,869
configuring the livestream stopping
getting all that going so little money

79
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,210
work party happens usually the weekend
before the con and then Wednesday before

80
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:57,479
the con is when she gets serious because
leading up to that point our houses and

81
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,250
garages being filled with boxes right to
the bags come on pallets and get a free

82
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,060
delivery and sometimes a freight
delivery driver doesn't want to navigate

83
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,960
our driveway so then the fred goes back
to the warehouse to get freight company

84
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,138
with different truck and any shows up in
his trucks lifted is broken and then he

85
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:12,800
has to go back

86
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:20,430
eventually the goddamn bag show up so
the houses I mean it's getting four we

87
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,879
actually have a new puppy it's a corgi
it's about the size of a loaf of bread

88
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:29,000
and and imagine life as a corgi in the
Potter household in the three weeks

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,720
leading up with your universe is defined
by everything that's a foot taller

90
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,479
shorter University Purdue University
getting smaller every day

91
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,270
boxes that revision exist anymore like
it are interested in the room of what

92
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,008
was done at like eight seconds when I
was like oh wait it's nothing to do it

93
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:51,690
there's no space that dr. itself so the
Wednesday before the con in the morning

94
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,050
we staged all the bags and all the way
and everything gets stuffed into the

95
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,819
damn bags and and then starting the
afternoon realize that one person

96
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,690
hospitals here which i think was yeah
let's hear it for minimal hospital

97
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,659
visits to the bag stuffing yeah that's
true we did one person to go there first

98
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:17,449
and they were like we hope we will dial
911 for you and they did absolutely to

99
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:24,080
dial 911 on his behalf so so we ended up
restarting the afternoon and we finished

100
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,590
about midnight so take about eight hours
to stop this wagon all the bags that was

101
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,799
like 35 40 people all standard house and
huge production lines every piece of

102
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,349
paper has to be collated and shoved into
the program and then the program's get

103
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:42,120
put in a box and then the bags have to
get open and all stuck it stopped in by

104
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,199
people working assembly line in the
basket put back into boxes that had to

105
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,650
be taped up to the doctor bags get
bigger it is having its weird it also

106
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,669
feels like it's gonna fall off so I am
very like a gimbal right now just

107
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:59,258
straight ahead so it at the end of it
you know it's eight hours a series

108
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:04,690
manual labor and gets loaded into a 26
foot box truck and then the next morning

109
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,229
we get up and we take all the non-bank
rapids in the house and loaded in and

110
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:11,289
then we get our storage unit and we take
all the extra stuff that was in storage

111
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:15,090
like the racks and the old t-shirt and a
lot of computers and power supplies and

112
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,270
jam that into a 26 which rock and I
swear to God there might have been about

113
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:25,508
for cubic feet to spare this year so we
had a comment box and and there was

114
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:29,849
almost no room to spare so please God by
the old t-shirts that her in

115
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:34,140
registration it's super important to us
that we don't take those homes year so

116
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,578
we will have bags of crack next year so
one thing we do is we acquire like you

117
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:43,539
know fifty water bottles here and a
hundred no pets they're a bunch of bands

118
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,610
and stuff like that all this week on
branded stuff that we just doesn't give

119
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,850
you order to get water exactly how much
you need every year so we started doing

120
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,620
bags of crap a result little bags of
crap for 15 bucks and big bags grab for

121
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,079
ten or something like that and it's all
just a flag and this year we decided we

122
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:02,209
didn't quite have enough junk to do that
next year we will see the bags of crap

123
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,829
will be back again next year so much to
do with staff but I think it's more

124
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:09,399
interesting than the fact that we had
different departments so shockingly

125
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:14,459
there's different departments and the
Potters children oh yeah and to be clear

126
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:23,099
this is a family and ever my kids R kids
their mind when they're bad so are our

127
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,970
kids do a lot of work to help out the
move a lot of boxes a lot of boxes they

128
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,970
do not like that and then they help with
babysitting the laser so we have this

129
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,500
industrial laser cutter that were used
to make the badges and sits in the

130
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,890
garage and is one thing you're not
supposed to do with laser which is like

131
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:42,610
leave it unattended between that and the
puppy like bad things will happen right

132
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:48,819
and so they sent out there and they play
minecraft her game they're playing and

133
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:53,500
then every 45 minutes or so and they
take the stuff out and put a new sheet

134
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,819
included all out vacuum it up whatever
he has to get done but every eight or

135
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:00,930
nine seats at the state take the whole
thing down and clean the optics and do

136
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,029
that nigga don't know how to do that and
they spent two weekends ago like between

137
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:10,290
22 and probably 24 hours between two
days just sitting in the garage and it's

138
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:17,599
not heated so that poison out there is
little pieces little for little pieces

139
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,150
you got that attach the wheels

140
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:29,689
my oldest son Darren punched all 9,000
of those out by hand

141
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:35,310
morning around your neck or
five-year-old punch the holes and most

142
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:40,619
of those yeah he really enjoys punching
holes in those little plastic cards it

143
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,350
was pretty pretty amusing Sao ko in just
his reference like you too manly punch

144
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,550
those because a manual bad cutter to
punch those holes cost lake and I was

145
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:56,849
like 80 bucks the automatic machine to
do that costly to Grand cuz I have no

146
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,170
idea I assume it's because you're
entering the round like a die cut

147
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,490
machine at that point and so it becomes
very different to do it automated

148
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,180
fashion but the badge printer itself
costs like 1400 bucks and I'm like ok I

149
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,689
like an automated baggage cutter thing
to like they'll be to grant extra white

150
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,820
I will just get them anyone else trying
to get to do it and so that's that's

151
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,300
what we did so those things work out
great and so it turns out that

152
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,069
foreigners are not working on a box is
not that expensive to have one and it

153
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:28,210
takes about 40 seconds a badge to print
those things so I mean it's a while but

154
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:32,440
you can put in lots of a hundred and
fifty-two shot as he just threw it over

155
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,430
the course of a couple days we have we
get them done sir

156
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,290
also over the badge machine for the
Badgers either dye sub so it's basically

157
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,880
got pieces of film exactly the same size
as the badge and it's got cYM K and

158
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,170
overlay coat so it's got four panels per
fic five panels per and every side takes

159
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:01,010
five panels so the individual died I
roles are 300 sets of panels and since

160
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:07,620
we've been a double-sided 250 cards per
thing to say nothing goes wrong and that

161
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,280
equate I think it's 55 bucks a role for
those things those 55 bucks per hundred

162
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,730
and fifty badges plus the badges
themselves are actually pretty damn

163
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:23,160
cheap the what's interesting is actually
we have their badge role died film is

164
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:29,130
Arpit enabled because they don't want
you using counterfeit badges I still

165
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:33,660
need except it doesn't actually identify
what kind of died film it just says it

166
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,420
was manufactured by the company but you
can specify the driver like it's never

167
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,740
gonna die film it would be like no it's
not I can't tell what's going on abort

168
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,850
abort abort and what you can't figure
this shit out like you are fading here

169
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,620
so i cant like steel dis and and make my
own film or something but you can't say

170
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,990
oh by the way it cya mkay instead of
just caterers anyone really random

171
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,130
Radboud really pissed off every dollar
spent all the money in the art video and

172
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,860
I still have to tell it like what it is

173
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:09,970
sharks are no that was our the the the
the lads badges then press badges are

174
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,410
laminate badges like you would give her
a concert or something like that and you

175
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,870
can get a holographic dye cotton stamped
on those it was interesting because

176
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,430
about a year and a half ago it's a
company called access events and clases

177
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:27,949
or something that a las vegas are super
responsive I send an article last minute

178
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,870
and I take it that should made and sent
to us and it's it's fantastic but they

179
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:37,480
sent us an advisory security advisory
and they said hey one of our holographic

180
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,930
shipments was lost in transit and we can
we don't know what happened and so we

181
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,370
have to believe that their potential
people out there counter their badges so

182
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,730
you know here's the old pattern and then
here's the new pattern that we've had in

183
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,900
reserve for the when this happens and
we're gonna shift and actually have my

184
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:00,390
key management in place for their
holograms and like can you come advise

185
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:06,880
some of these companies like us at some
goods a really well with advisory that's

186
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,589
amazing in all they do is make little
you know $0.30 for convention so gold

187
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:18,380
star for access passes in Las Vegas
anyway or not at all

188
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:28,720
jack will be back next year and the next
two years so next year is 17 for those

189
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,050
that know if you subtract 1/4 the means
his inauguration here which makes having

190
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:38,560
events and EC kind of complicated so we
signed up for next year we are the dates

191
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,099
will now

192
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:46,970
ok so we've got that locked out its
harder like that it was one of the big

193
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,430
things we found early on is how did
indeed see every four years it's kind of

194
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,130
complicated because inauguration happens
and it pushes everything out to the side

195
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,710
and everybody kind of gets crushed up
against it and things get really tight

196
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,960
for the few weeks running operation so
we were lucky we got here next year and

197
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,130
then and then the year after dates to
float a little bit year-to-year police

198
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,050
were pretty well walked around and
looking for the next couple of years

199
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:18,660
see ap stats acceptance rate Leah said
3000 222 talks coming in you know we end

200
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,620
up with quite so you know we're not
making more space here so you only have

201
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,130
thirty-some-odd slots to fill the rate
was pretty low we did have evolved US

202
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,710
emissions you know again

203
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,850
dubiously dubious methods to try to
figure out male and female submissions

204
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:41,960
but as best we can tell we had 39 female
and and 263 male authors on the talks

205
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:47,090
and that was by far the largest number
of female physicians we've had you'll

206
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:53,660
know it's still not anywhere near like
half but it is an improvement and he was

207
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,219
pointed out earlier due to some folks we
don't really actively solicit you know

208
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,390
to have email submissions are solutions
for one demographic group or another and

209
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,890
so this is kind of I think it is a
baseline like this is the state of the

210
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,970
industry right now I think or other
organizations have made a concerted

211
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,530
effort to push hard in that space and
they had better numbers but this is our

212
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:18,420
experience right now without pushing one
another

213
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,349
you can see that talks to more than one
track people you know I think once we

214
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:28,160
took our break it people would get
confuse like I broke this thing and and

215
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,100
there's nothing called break it and so
they were just Christmas tree like I can

216
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,140
sit anywhere that doesn't mean nevermind
so we did see the breaker tracks would

217
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,620
really what would have conventionally
been an offensive talking to break a

218
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,329
track they would get confused about
where to land it so so far

219
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:50,920
yeah the chart it's just a picture

220
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,829
charts and graphs charts and graphs
letterman fans here

221
00:16:55,829 --> 00:17:01,579
retired before you were born I think so
we did was our largest addition year

222
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:06,230
it's interesting because I think other
conferences have had a kind of continual

223
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,510
increase in talks admissions and we had
to drop for a few years I'm not entirely

224
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,919
sure why but this year at that all
turned around so we'll see but it's a

225
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:28,720
lot of talks so how to hack the
selection so first of all directions

226
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,600
whenever this at the beginning and you
know this is just important in your

227
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,449
professional career in general like you
should understand how to read there are

228
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,149
so many reading comprehension fails for
this conference it is on fucking

229
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:46,500
believable like honestly so we'll send a
message like hey vendor welcomes UConn

230
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,779
here's your bar codes or whatever
information we need very clearly do you

231
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:55,830
need network do you need power do you
need whatever ok please and before we

232
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,449
send you our codes you must send us
payment cuz we're not going to do

233
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,130
anything before we get payment from you

234
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:17,529
ok ok ten fifteen days later I'm gonna
they're awesome it was last year was

235
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:22,980
like that I think we win really hardcore
hard line on it two years ago

236
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,500
all repeat the question is for amateurs

237
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:37,650
I like to take the you can infer the
question for my answer I like that he

238
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:43,280
asked if you ask for GM's

239
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:51,399
what about actually iacocca left that
place went to shit so he did what did

240
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,500
you ask sir

241
00:18:53,500 --> 00:19:10,520
the question yes that's what he asked
for those that are on my ideas how he

242
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,290
talks got disqualified this year for not
following directions there was really

243
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,820
only like in the units in years past
being kind of soft in about two years

244
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,740
ago we took a pretty hard line in a
clear gonna take a hard line and people

245
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,070
have been much better about the
corrections but to go back to the

246
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:31,389
previous story before you interrupted me
the consulate get vendors you right back

247
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,820
after recent in this email couple of
emails outlined process and i dont have

248
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,470
my bar codes yet like what we don't have
your money so we made a pretty clean and

249
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,030
beginning we r barcodes and then two
days later be like I don't see a logo on

250
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,490
the website well you haven't given us
your logo yet

251
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:52,300
like you know that that's a predicate
for us to do anything with it and it's

252
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,720
interesting because I'm workin
organizations that have pretty strong

253
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,830
branding marketing departments who get
really grumpy when their vendors or

254
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,659
other people take their logo and put it
somewhere without their permission or

255
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,500
using the logo that's not the right logo
for that for him like a print logo and

256
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,970
use it on the web you're not allowed to
do that so we don't just go to people's

257
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,820
websites and grab their logos and
putting on our site like until you send

258
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:17,110
us like this is the logo to use we open
up your logo we have had a few vendors

259
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,300
real shock like why don't you just use
our logo from the website well because

260
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,320
for every one person that thinks that's
ok there's fifty that thinks it's a

261
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,030
really stupid idea so we outline is very
clearly and invariably Heidi Nelson

262
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:35,889
swear I can't understand it every year
this happens so follow directions please

263
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:42,759
its important what that was my imitation
of you by the way

264
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:51,570
notice you're desperate actually break
yeah it's one of those like thinking

265
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:58,599
everyone so keep I guess we're gonna
keep ya explain your ideas so we don't

266
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:07,489
have a complicated see if you responded
to see if he wants so I mean anyone

267
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:11,489
interested in academic conference like
where you write a paper right and like

268
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:15,409
it's it's complicated like that that's
complicated I'll say so many academic

269
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:19,749
conferences complicated right like we
asked for an annotated outline that

270
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:22,249
means like an outline with a couple
sentences associated with these

271
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:25,919
high-level it that's all annotated
outline means and we will get everything

272
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:33,209
in between a call barring napkin kind of
outline that like white 1 I'm gonna do

273
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:39,569
an internal point to something else .
see you did it using automatic number in

274
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:44,609
like that's impressive to something like
eighteen power points that I made on

275
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:47,439
this topic like no that's not the thing
either

276
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,219
you know it's a middle ground and but
you have to consider concisely explain

277
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:55,799
your idea like to a person who is
unfamiliar with your project your

278
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:01,279
concept or idea please explain it it's
not hard but that's why few years ago

279
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,989
the feedback was well it's still not
clear what you want so there's examples

280
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:10,139
right and and for those with examples
helpful ok I mean those are really

281
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:15,439
almost exactly what we want right i mean
to resubmit are examples back to us but

282
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,549
it's pretty close to what we want also
please note there's only one season

283
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:25,009
shook on it with no matter what you
doing if it's correspondence with us if

284
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:28,909
it's a request for some nature if it's
sending email and you put the CD in the

285
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:33,409
domain it won't even get to us but like
people come grab your tickets are

286
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:35,909
talking about why they're so badass and
they should come to the conference in

287
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:39,900
the small conference Ron know what

288
00:22:39,900 --> 00:23:29,929
yeah you did ya the best thing that I
thought

289
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:49,879
said the best thing I saw this year that
way for a story I like I what was the

290
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:57,309
best thing she saw this year now you
can't even talk about it wasn't me like

291
00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:07,769
we were saying earlier I can't even talk
some often gets admitted to multiple

292
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:11,409
tracks which is which is mostly fine we
can kind of mostly figure it out but

293
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:17,659
this one is talking he said to us if not
to the track names I have there because

294
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:23,259
one of those is no longer in existence
of sorry but you know selected for this

295
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:26,789
track here is horrible change the topic
I am selected for this track I will

296
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:31,369
focus on these things on my subject and
I thought you know not selected first of

297
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,369
all and second of all I just thought it
was brilliant because he did the work

298
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:38,029
for us and we don't have to come back to
him and say ok we're gonna put you in

299
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:43,429
this track but you know here's are you
going to change things so fit yeah we

300
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:46,190
have had people there were like hey we
think this talk is better fit for this

301
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,869
record is fraction of the time they're
OK with and sometimes I get a little

302
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:54,168
grumpy and including likewise people
like they don't think it's a better one

303
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:57,940
track mind shorten up sometimes it's a
little difficult thing for them to hear

304
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,529
like I don't think this is 15-20 minutes
where the content and so that's a

305
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:05,789
conversation we tend to approach for a
delicately but we had done that in the

306
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:07,139
past as well

307
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:13,508
sales model so the card the card the
thing that actually sell the tickets is

308
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:17,470
actually largely unchanged the last
three or four years right is that

309
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,309
correct

310
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,720
the most part yeah this is Minh City few
tweaks and and and bug fixes but for the

311
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,600
most part the card itself when you get
to reg dot com dot org

312
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,658
the actual that's the thing that sells
tickets that does ok apart leading up to

313
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:36,190
it this year that's what kind of song
and we went over that opening but the

314
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,700
long story short is we we put up an
intermediate site that was

315
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,590
not honor main CMS called landing much
more contoured and landing was a name

316
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:50,070
for extra large running engine X and
basically nothing else and its 3,400

317
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:57,389
regressive second I didn't even break a
sweat suit does sales so because of the

318
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,789
heck up in round one with the CDN we
sold out in two minutes

319
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:06,440
2.58 seconds which is a fair bit longer
like eight hundred percent longer than

320
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,740
years past but that was almost wholly to
the CDN because the second round we sold

321
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,750
900 tickets in under nine seconds so
presumably the first round of the cDNA

322
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:24,710
got in the way I think we would have
done better if people ask me all I think

323
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,649
these are a bunch of you know again lots
or whatever we track IPOs which

324
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:33,370
addresses we track how many email
addresses birds in one round vs both in

325
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,418
that kind of thing and and by name we
know a number of people that purchased

326
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:41,620
in both rounds of these are people that
we know and that's bill Allison gym and

327
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:58,399
whatever so sir

328
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,570
what are your thoughts on that matter ok
it's been a service before and I think

329
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:17,439
that we go to the next and I said yes to
an open source in the car and everything

330
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,130
you know I think initially there were
concerns around people learning what

331
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:28,280
we're doing it right he gave it because
people do i mean we've talked about how

332
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,500
people try to give it like people
burning the freakin reverse proxies and

333
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,870
all kinds of stuff so I think we're
still trying to think through that part

334
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,610
of it like if there's anything that we
would be worried about that would allow

335
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:43,959
people to gain weight advantage
especially from about construction

336
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,760
perspectives so we have worked with
other events did kind of you know give

337
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,560
them are what we've learned in our
pointers and that kind of thing so that

338
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:57,260
they can write similar systems any other
events have helped us to to be clear

339
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:03,280
yeah well I used to start you know the
best crypto the other writing coming

340
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,020
analyzed like you know fully but this is
one of those situations like yet maybe

341
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,639
maybe there are loopholes but then the
daily we have other jobs and things we

342
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,770
need to do and so keeping some of those
clothes hold makes it so we don't have

343
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,210
to constantly plug a hole punch holes
that people find out about and deal with

344
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:21,860
it honestly like beyond the server
crashing my biggest fear the day of

345
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:26,030
ticket sales is that somebody figure
something out and reserves like 50% the

346
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,990
tickets my biggest know what's your
biggest fear that we're gonna forget to

347
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:33,799
run ticket so we're not gonna forget

348
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,539
the morning I wake up and I feel like
I'm going to barf and I realize I'm not

349
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:43,369
pregnant that's the day as ticket sales
so because of that happens when you get

350
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:49,439
around like this is unfair but they give
it to the other half the people except

351
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,649
for that one person and then we have a
small around the next time you know how

352
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:57,479
do you manage that and that's going to
be kind of a shit storm if and when it

353
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,399
ever ever happens and so every year that
we had that flailing around like we used

354
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:07,629
to just have a script automatically
launch ticket sales at noon right and

355
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:11,639
then with the server was getting
hammered and the server processes are

356
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:15,758
bouncing up and down and run SSH you
were like hitting keys and ten minutes

357
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,340
later the keystrokes are showing up a
box down the box isn't anywhere near us

358
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:25,039
and like ticket sales just went live and
suddenly people like getting errors and

359
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,950
like what I got a ticket and then more
errors and hope here's another ticket

360
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,450
things are getting written to disk and
like half an hour later he managed to

361
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:37,659
shut everything down and then we got
these log files like seriously who got a

362
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:40,960
ticket you know people like I got to
this stage and I should have got to take

363
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,350
it was but you know I didn't get to hear
and whenever and it was a pain in the

364
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:49,559
ass reconstruct my mail is days of work
to make that happen an interesting side

365
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,619
note of that year

366
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:55,499
participate in those moods cluster year
that was it was a banner experience for

367
00:29:55,499 --> 00:30:03,799
everybody I wrote personally what I did
you know how I know I will tell you the

368
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:07,379
story of how I know I wrote everybody
personally because we had like 500 600

369
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:13,279
emails in the database from this
flopping around the system and I had a

370
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:19,940
right everybody and it was kind of like
a social so we did it but it came from

371
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,480
my computer here's how I

372
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:30,790
so we wrote an email that I think was
sufficiently vague to basically if you

373
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,668
got a ticket you would tell us he got a
ticket to take you would say oh sorry

374
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:36,559
thanks I'll try again later

375
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,580
most people on your honor seem to have
done the right thing but in order to

376
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,659
send it in mass I want to send it from
my Mac and I went to go use Automator to

377
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:54,280
do it and just because he used well I'm
sorry we rode my goddamn address book

378
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,500
anymore so in Automator in order to send
an email

379
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,980
placing an imaginary like I want to do
this

380
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,760
thousand times and it go and so to send
email I could have just written goddamn

381
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,790
shells and use Automator and ascended
bunch of emails you have to enter in

382
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:17,110
people's addresses in your address book
because I had to grab a contact address

383
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:21,820
book so I added all the addresses from
the database in my address book and that

384
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:26,299
send all those emails and not only that
but bailed out pops a window up for

385
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:32,830
every single one of those only 500
mailed my screen and send out all the

386
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:38,570
right it's all done and I forgot about
it and then I realized that I have five

387
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:44,330
hundred people in my address book down
there and they're saying to iCloud so

388
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:50,100
whenever a new phone and was like wait a
second I'm getting your contact list of

389
00:31:50,100 --> 00:32:05,090
the car legally start your car and like
if I can't I cannot dial in my contact

390
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:12,360
list it's absolutely impossible anyway
when I'm just so we know just how you

391
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,520
get an idea how hard the different
servers get ahead landing was talking

392
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,759
about 3,500

393
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:22,499
request the second at the peak the last
10 seconds or the worst we go forward

394
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:29,169
2000 across the second up to thirty five
hundred thousand 3500 in the in the

395
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:34,509
couple minutes leading up to it we saw
happening request so that's that's an

396
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:37,659
outgoing amount of web request

397
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:44,589
okay and then hits detects during the
first 20 seconds around one was about

398
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:50,219
$3,500 3300 falls off once people stop
their script from like hammering on the

399
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:54,529
frickin landing then they go over 26 and
that processes is pretty straightforward

400
00:32:54,529 --> 00:33:09,629
so I know what he was doing so we've ok
so the more about 2,000 people write

401
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:13,139
this is what we shoot for this is our
normal amount of attendance you know

402
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:17,008
people that don't show up to one year
that was no baka legs you know we had a

403
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:21,069
fair number of people not show up we
still had over 80% of the conference

404
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:29,759
show up in two feet of snow so people
couldn't make it that you're so that was

405
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:38,099
47 people roundabout they could come
down so 2037 have checked in so far as I

406
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:52,119
was due 2037 2052 says Paul Ryan thats
why we enjoy your financial policy so

407
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:58,689
much people on the live stream have no
idea what's going on I don't know Paul

408
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,450
Ryan attended

409
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:06,930
got diane feinstein here do we bring
them together across the aisle issue con

410
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:13,440
we don't have either of those two
viewable by the way why do we say the

411
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,850
same size you know this is kind of
thoughts P and yeah we talked about it

412
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:23,980
it's it's good for you is good for us if
secondhand sales we are in control of

413
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,340
people do with their tickets you know
like I said if we could not even know

414
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,580
who you r anybody they could that be
fine by us but we can cause we have to

415
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,630
get credit cards for people but we don't
really control what people do their

416
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:38,880
tickets and some people like well
there's gotta be a lot of speculators

417
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,170
someone stuff on eBay and historically
every year there's some but there's not

418
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,420
a lot and honestly there's a lot of
community pressure on people to not sell

419
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:51,420
their tickets for a profit you know it
at best they say you know i'll settle

420
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,050
for whatever you want baby doll
everything around 50 I'll just don't

421
00:34:54,050 --> 00:35:00,230
write more often than not the tickets
are sold on eBay have claws and other

422
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,510
than that we get a lot of tickets that
we see moving at face value you know

423
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,210
there doesn't seem to be a lot of
respect and and certainly that's not

424
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,810
something we take an active role in the
community at large as police that

425
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,960
heavily and whenever we see somebody on
Twitter saying like all so much you can

426
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,650
take it higher is better I'm amazed
about ten or twelve people being white

427
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:28,020
asshole god bless the Internet like this
with 11 on that one so some of these may

428
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,880
have been repeat listings so far you
seem that they were all you know you

429
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:42,590
need it was 29 total listings yeah which
is a pretty small number of tickets to

430
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,580
move across as a secondary market now
that said there are other secondary

431
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,450
markets

432
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:54,890
I loved this one on Facebook opposed
everything so it makes it was trying to

433
00:35:54,890 --> 00:36:01,660
sell one for $129 then you have the
wrong place so you wanna go to this

434
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:11,129
weekend boxing match weekend we could
all throw down our processing always a

435
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:20,700
big corn I don't think this is real
there's no no no it hurt anyone would

436
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,720
anyway

437
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:31,660
alright so do the hard numbers numbers
come with the caveat that these are back

438
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:36,890
of the neck and method I did you know an
hour ago yes so roughly defined as that

439
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:42,279
cold in this year $4,000 to give you a
sense of what it takes to run this on

440
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,480
the input that's why we have the ticket
sales number and sponsorship this is

441
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,280
maybe ten percent bigger five percent
last year

442
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,540
yes so it's not much from ticket sales
perspective and sponsorship return to

443
00:36:54,540 --> 00:37:05,259
dial up a bit in last year so anyway
yeah it's largely the same right like we

444
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,940
haven't changed the calculus here again
we're not trying to make money was going

445
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,650
to cover cover are not so what does that
mean to the hotel space so far very put

446
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:22,290
a hundred twenty grand to the hotel once
the party gets calculated party may be

447
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:27,240
thrown another twenty or thirty thousand
dollars about 90 K for this why I

448
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,810
between the bags and programs programs
nice this year and they were they were

449
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:45,560
they go around thinking here but she
didn't lay out the program was I think

450
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,380
he was even last year was cheaper than
last year because we have some printers

451
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,690
who suggested we dial down the sides by
3% so we could do to up on their their

452
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:01,060
paper instead of one and it saved us 20
cash that's why is the form factor that

453
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:05,890
it is as good as I could cut to a time
and so we get we use it going in

454
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:10,560
Columbia Maryland will call them out by
Dave they're also great and our last

455
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,849
minute bombs like the program on Friday
can have it done by next 10 years our

456
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:19,770
signage on Monday we need that by
Wednesday to do all decided to do these

457
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,329
signs all that kind of stuff pretty
environmentally friendly great

458
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:27,430
turnaround deal with my dad really lousy
graphics art skills I do most of the

459
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:32,279
work cited page and the lanyards in the
balls and all that good stuff and I did

460
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,109
a program covering that kind of thing so
when it fired from my current job out

461
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:44,150
I'll be applied as a graphic designer
level one but it's expensive right like

462
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:48,000
all the programs are not cheap and and I
think we've had to be like you really

463
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,109
need programs and then the day I think
you still need help you still need

464
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:54,560
something something physical but it
doesn't need to be anything outrageous

465
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,910
and we try to keep it you know for a
fact that's manageable the bag materials

466
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:03,690
and consumables like the acrylic and
avoid all kind of some costs associated

467
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,359
with it

468
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:09,049
we've got a bunch of new switches this
year about four core Cisco switches and

469
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:16,390
a bunch of pretty low that's because
we're no longer doing them ourselves so

470
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:23,098
there's no labor just just art soul
there's actually a lot of labor costs

471
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:33,980
but there's no money as they do not
apply in the event for family and

472
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:39,200
eventing pastor this culture lumbering
so I grew up in a limo company Family

473
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,790
Guy damn penny machine orders because
even when I was 14 or 15 it was

474
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:52,800
considered a hazardous occupation I can
work their family and then one day so I

475
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,640
worked there and I got made into the
table from the vending machine and so I

476
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:01,779
would show up at the bank once a week
and just file change on the table and

477
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,450
say hey can you give me dollar bills for
this and there's a small town so they

478
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:08,710
were nice and did it one day I was
working the way in the back of lumber

479
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:15,490
yard and radio and said hey David its my
brother he was working as the guys like

480
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:20,509
that guy from New York State labors here
is just coming to do a quick inspections

481
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:26,319
I want you clean up everything down
there and come up to the office like

482
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,839
Roger that is like home

483
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:37,719
like the back way you want me to walk is
a creek is like God don't go back to the

484
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:43,210
office without the bag filled up the
road a walk like a pile back to my house

485
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:48,799
would like covered in mud mckree monthly
what the hell I got from New York State

486
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:56,549
showed up so I break my son's in the
same thing of Maryland rolls out the

487
00:40:56,549 --> 00:41:08,690
back window the neighbors have a plan to
their long lost you know we did by our

488
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:13,259
labs vendors been great about bringing
sandwiches in stopping course which is

489
00:41:13,259 --> 00:41:16,239
four years but we know we got to live
another good graces and do we had at

490
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,059
some point get her own stuff so we
actually made an investment this year

491
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:23,319
earlier to infrastructures all managed
switches at the edge you can push reel

492
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:28,170
and rod whatever it and it works pretty
well you guys had a good experience

493
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:32,559
thumbs up to the last spoke so glad we
made that investment other areas across

494
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:33,569
the board

495
00:41:33,569 --> 00:41:37,869
credit card fees and insurance went up a
lot like I was honored this year you'd

496
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:43,969
be really cheap now it's just kind of
keep making mistakes we must get out so

497
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:47,690
I was to have two million dollars a
coverage on top of her g general

498
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:53,780
liability and other production companies
got but the retelling like Philadelphia

499
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,090
underwrite sit and do so if you're
looking to run it at Philadelphia's

500
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:01,180
pretty flexible like we describe what we
do you like they're not gonna write this

501
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,930
shit I think it's to grant to get two
million the coverage so if you hurt

502
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,149
yourself just make sure you do two
million dollars or lessen damage to your

503
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,100
cell phone will be fine

504
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:16,940
estimated taxes doesn't come crawl over
a so it's almost $380,000 around the con

505
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:21,980
so not achieve Connor run right that
said I feel like we do a reasonable

506
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:30,330
professional job right

507
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:48,540
1950 show their guys that was so you
know really are i mean i think im going

508
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:52,220
ever since you know it all started this
fun little experiment you know years ago

509
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:57,359
use those responsible for the first
first mortgages house to pay the fucking

510
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:03,150
bill man who was not screwing around and
we want to be like we can put on to call

511
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:07,650
names something as high quality black
cat for a 10th brace right and while

512
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,800
this doesn't quite how to brush equality
blackout certainly discouraged room with

513
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,170
all that work in vendor floor and
everything going on I still think it 450

514
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:21,020
bucks it's a pretty good expensive
expenditure your money consider you also

515
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,220
get a party tonight we're potentially
under $50 liquors

516
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,259
so please guys Jones

517
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,530
sales accepted that's where your two
million dollar cost is delivered I did

518
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:42,390
get hooked up to $2 machine that's
that's so excited dialysis machine like

519
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:49,120
that so that's your kidney right what's
a pig liver called death I guess

520
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:56,880
yet ready so the Badgers waves are
consumable so we are laser cutter now

521
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,120
and we basically recoup their costs on
it by using in the last two years time

522
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,020
I'm laser is expensive part of it is
that consumables associated with it so

523
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,650
the filter so we got this indoor filter
they can run so there's no external

524
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:13,550
venting of gases into my neighbor's yard
and the first part is mechanical filter

525
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:18,390
so I can air filter on a car except it's
about a cubic foot and a half and it's a

526
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:25,720
big cost 500 bucks her feel turks so to
help write seriously to help that along

527
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,509
actually take air conditioning filters
and laid on top

528
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:32,740
those are like a buck 50 in Balt and
those things I just ripped out and pop

529
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,759
in really quick

530
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,060
salt or two about 15 or 20 to replace
the big one which actually had to do

531
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,400
once this year and then underneath that
is activated carbon activated charcoal

532
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,760
about the same size two giant bags of
that so that you can run this thing

533
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:52,140
inside is activated charcoal need to get
changed out about every 1,000 hours of

534
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:57,200
service or quote when it starts to smell
bad

535
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,000
like what that really means is volatile
chemicals are in the air and you smell

536
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,110
the harm you know esters and ketones in
jet things like this

537
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:11,940
free hydrogen molecules and hurts like
hell but you know i guess i guess its

538
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,900
time all you have in stock I'll wait a
week like it's cool I just won't die

539
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:26,760
slowly yes sir

540
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:32,720
a gold star he's asking if the fire
extinguisher we have is designed to not

541
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,200
damage the optic so we have to fire
extinguishers than one is that is

542
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,640
there's a problem fire extinguisher the
other one is my god is a real problem

543
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,450
fire extinguisher so the first one
that's designed not to damage optics is

544
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:48,140
a co2 fire extinguisher so co2 fire
extinguishers are cheap and away too

545
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:58,279
much fun to discharge write about
something that you think about out so

546
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,230
that's the way I like if something goes
a little rock use that to try to get the

547
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:06,760
fire out and get the material out of the
laser that we have a normal ABC fire

548
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,970
extinguisher that will prob screw up the
objects but will prevent the house

549
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:13,890
burning down so we're both of those
directly next to the waves are just in

550
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:21,920
case things go sideways in recent her
children kids here's how to use it

551
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:30,200
manageable size they're stronger good
strong kids they are doing so well spent

552
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,240
$1000 on gaffer's tape this year so

553
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:41,490
knows I think eight feet of gaffer tape
stuff's expensive likes not screen but

554
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:47,740
you don't we have to put the gaffer tape
now in a little device that you locals

555
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:54,189
against a top of their frickin cord and
he just lays it down flat it is amazing

556
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,560
it's a lot of fun and much like a co2
extinguisher it's really expensive what

557
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:08,369
you have too much fun with it but the
gas gun now they won't let me I had to

558
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:14,440
be briefed on it past the briefing we
also feed the volunteers how does a

559
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,100
great job of people to deliver food yes
calling people to deliver food so we

560
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:25,060
have fifty people outside a lot of a lot
of muffins like so we just call and BBQ

561
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:32,170
or whatever man there's limits Casco can
provide money left over this year maybe

562
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:35,740
for it to $40,000 but that I think will
be pushing it we were pretty close to

563
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:39,529
the bone this year which is nice in a
few years but we had some pretty high

564
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:44,380
but they kept on testing at the vendors
anything on the dams life that's why I

565
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,710
was blank

566
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:54,600
we're gonna have an argument I didn't
know that was really fighting but she's

567
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:01,580
actually bad about what to wear 25
sponsors including the sponsors real ABS

568
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:06,569
so as boxers show up with gear and
usually an engineer to help out so

569
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:13,210
thanks a lot of sponsors and we actually
did dial down general sponsorships you

570
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,550
the reason why this number is only to
less than last year's has regained more

571
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:20,930
labs which is a good thing but there are
different buckets anyway so generous

572
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:25,310
sponsorship has been dialed back of it
back by five but we picked up my legs

573
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:34,509
Brian sponsorship yeah very strange
reserved for small start-ups and things

574
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:38,110
like that we've had companies have been
proud sponsors for a while that try to

575
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:41,560
come back this year has brought here for
years as bronze and you gotta gotta move

576
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,850
move out because we try to keep it open
for companies are really up in common

577
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:49,490
and and you know keep it is very
expenses right very expensive he still

578
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:53,560
get a table and it's a big deal so we
don't want companies abusing that so

579
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:58,049
we've been pretty serious about it we
also have a silver and silver no table

580
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:01,140
options because there are some companies
that unsurprisingly just want to get

581
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:05,310
tickets to the conference and put their
logo up into really want to table and so

582
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:09,950
that's been Marley popular spot we
thought it was going to be told what I

583
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:15,609
offered and sold out in record time so I
guess it was a popular popular and

584
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:22,240
needed to be yeah we had a fair number
of sponsorship acceptances request there

585
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,660
tonight including one that came out like
three days before the car like are there

586
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,339
any last-minute sponsorship
opportunities like what the hell with

587
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:35,180
that even be going to print yeah like
thanks for your money by that's a

588
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:42,339
sponsorship level ok but we do try to
you know provide reasonable value for

589
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:50,430
the money I think that these sponsors do
tend to get out of this we are here

590
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:59,589
alright so I think the sponsors we do
encourage them to do something a little

591
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:03,800
bit different this is not a trade show
some skin sponsors get all confused by

592
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:09,820
that first foot by foot popup thing 16
but why the be someone exactly three

593
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:15,050
inches away from you so no like it like
that and some sponsors have still tried

594
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:18,779
to put up there a foot by foot thing

595
00:50:18,779 --> 00:50:25,169
looking at someone right now he refused
to make eye contact with me but I i

596
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:29,759
think we have a pretty good relations
with our sponsors and and and at the end

597
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:34,579
of the day I think we've we've got a
good middle ground to have positive

598
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:39,809
engagement with them so we're always
open to feedback from the sponsors and

599
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:44,640
in general are open to feedback in any
way shape or form I will say we don't

600
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,749
tend to engage on social media very much
you know it's not something that you

601
00:50:49,749 --> 00:50:53,158
know run the con you know that the
country's modern we spend a little bit

602
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:58,159
of time to get around that but for the
for the large part we don't answer

603
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:02,249
questions on their the best way to get
over this is 43 mail email feedback and

604
00:51:02,249 --> 00:51:06,718
forgot or we try to have a more formal
feedback thing for a while branson put

605
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:11,299
together is awesome feedback system and
everybody goes like Halle Berry ways do

606
00:51:11,299 --> 00:51:14,009
feedback would be cool if I could
provide feedback on talks and whatever

607
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:20,049
brands and spent many many many hours
making this work and whatever number of

608
00:51:20,049 --> 00:51:24,880
people that would be back to that system
was negligible like really not satisfied

609
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,659
for Branson super smart dude with a lot
effort in it it's just not it doesn't

610
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:32,739
feel good when you know doesn't work out
so I appreciate all the effort you put

611
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:36,759
into it but we've gone back to old
school like just email feedback Todd

612
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:41,549
curator go through it all and again like
and we try to respond it's funny cuz

613
00:51:41,549 --> 00:51:46,369
even during like the talks are the
ticket sales process like people uncork

614
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:49,869
it on us an email and I will send back
like five minutes

615
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:53,789
our response and point-by-point works
for it and people like wow thats I

616
00:51:53,789 --> 00:51:56,359
hadn't thought about that I can
appreciate you taking the time whatever

617
00:51:56,359 --> 00:51:59,729
and nine times out of ten people back
down in tears happy to have

618
00:51:59,729 --> 00:52:03,739
conversations I think the one thing to
take away for us some feedback like as a

619
00:52:03,739 --> 00:52:04,829
two-way street

620
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:07,439
tell us what's good what's bad it
doesn't work we'll have a conversation

621
00:52:07,439 --> 00:52:10,769
with you and we'll try to make it better
so I've been told to stop and people

622
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:15,549
looking at us said anything else to add
do I guess
