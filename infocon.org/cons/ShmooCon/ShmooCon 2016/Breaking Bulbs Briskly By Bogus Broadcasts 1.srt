1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,370
alright are we ready everyone I think
we're ready

2
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:22,900
alright everybody we're ready to start
ed are you guys ready

3
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:30,630
alright so welcome to shrink on 2016
we're going to start the toxin I first

4
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:43,780
one is breaking bulbs briskly by bogus
broadcasts news regarding bogus

5
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:53,410
broadcast allow us the opportunity to
appreciate it my name's Joe nine then

6
00:00:53,410 --> 00:01:02,379
today with some tools work against the
wave networks as well as discuss

7
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:06,899
exploiting Wireless automation systems
in order to break your ass and balls in

8
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,650
a rather quick manner so what you see
there in the in the animation is just

9
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,320
the hardware components that go along
with the software and tools that will be

10
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:28,609
talking later in particular some one
suffered find radios z-wave devices was

11
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,630
just a basic information about the
Weyburn those that might not be familiar

12
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,750
it is a proprietary low rate wireless
network protocols operates in the 900

13
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,049
megahertz spectrum even if you're not
familiar with the protocol they probably

14
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:44,110
come across devices every day

15
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,640
realize it there are several hundred
companies out there that neither

16
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,600
manufacture or sell the wave capable
smart devices in the bread and butter

17
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,070
for this protocol right now is really
the

18
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:04,750
home automation and security systems
with over 35 million devices sold as you

19
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,970
it has a fairly large market share

20
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,720
ranging from simple as smart plugs and
light bulbs will be more complicated

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,840
devices like door locks environmental
sensors like smoke detectors are sensors

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:25,330
and an even more physically robust
devices like a water leak detection and

23
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:33,580
energy meters then he has been security
research on a similar wireless protocols

24
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,110
for quite a while now when I started
working for him not to long ago he said

25
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:49,570
Joe wants to go do some research on the
security of this proprietary protocol a

26
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,799
good security researcher the first thing
I do is I start looking for what's

27
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,820
already out there nobody really wants to
recreate the wheel that takes way too

28
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:03,010
much time however since the protocol is
proprietary requires signing an NDA in

29
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,359
order get your hands on this site for
development in there wasn't very much

30
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,650
out there so first there's a open source
project called open z-wave provide

31
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,049
suffer libraries for interacting with
z-wave USB stick this is great if you

32
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:24,610
want to develop your own automation
software but doesn't really allow you to

33
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,549
operate outside the bounds of the
protocol which is really what a lot of

34
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:38,230
security research is about so I decided
to just force that was presented the

35
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,970
black hat 2013 seemed really promising
other than the closed source nature of

36
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:50,450
the custom firmware and software for
this presentation they talked about

37
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,410
using this Texas Instruments transceiver
in order to

38
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:02,450
exploit a.m. implementation law in the
key exchange program one particular

39
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:09,230
z-wave door lock in order to reset the
private key unauthorized access to the

40
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,760
door and be able to control the door
lock

41
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,659
really promising however when we were
unable to replicate the functionality of

42
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,320
the stool which was awesome

43
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,900
asking questions of the developer taking
down of course instead of trying to

44
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:29,060
figure out how to force the school to
work for my needs to move on and I don't

45
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,070
know maybe radio again presented black
hat so this isn't really a z-wave tool

46
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:41,180
it's more of a framework allows you to
build your own wireless sniffer and

47
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,170
injector on top of his list AP radio
framework uses the well-known Stevie

48
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:54,060
packet packet manipulation many of us in
this audience are familiar with and then

49
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,320
it also uses the capabilities to control
sufferance and radios radio which is a

50
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:06,090
much more specialized even better this
presentation the guys into a basic

51
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:13,799
support protocol in order to demonstrate
a packet replay attack while there's not

52
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,960
really a robust set of z-wave
exploitation tools on par with a killer

53
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,090
bee framework for me for those that are
familiar with that there is at least the

54
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:33,270
foundation allowed me to start playing
with prices and today he wanted to make

55
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:39,060
available a tool that collectively I
call the heat wave it is built on top of

56
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:47,540
radio with extended support for the
protocol so the state radio for their

57
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,200
presentation the basics implementation
of the protocol that has three command

58
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,320
classes which are groups of device
functionality extended that to my total

59
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:04,150
of 33 I'm so we can do more stuff with
easy way of includes three stand-alone

60
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,969
tools the first one is called easiest
under a yes it's named after a bee stung

61
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,780
work on the killer bee framework again
from this number does not work discovery

62
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:21,909
and enumeration next we have easy recon
which integrates individual devices on a

63
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,720
network in order to solicit information
to see less that they're just happens to

64
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,940
me information that would really be
useful for security researcher who's

65
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,660
trying to figure out if there's actually
any security in the UAE was of course my

66
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:41,500
job at the time and environment we have
easy fingerprint which exploits

67
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,920
differences in transceiver design in
order to distinguish between different

68
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:52,860
generations within the target device
does this by manipulating the physical

69
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:01,260
layer preamble in such a way that the
older generation transmissions and

70
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,260
respond

71
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,820
whereas the newer generation model was
not able to see her eyes with the

72
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,360
physical layer frame and therefore can
respond that allows us to determine what

73
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,140
generation module arguing with so when
limitation to bring up at this point is

74
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,460
if the target devices using encryption
tools not able to get the current state

75
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,640
or the configuration settings of the
target of eyes everything listen there's

76
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,710
is the fair game

77
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,450
encryption and because we had a really
spirited discussion with a particular

78
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,969
device manufacturer just last week

79
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:47,070
security within the protocol does
support AES 128 awesome completely left

80
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,310
to the individual device manufacturers
in order to use it in each of their

81
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:55,630
devices security researchers wanted to
find out how

82
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:05,520
repurchase 33 popular z-wave devices
available today on the market with only

83
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,659
nine of them actually I'm supporting
corruption that out of those 9505 them

84
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,280
were door locks hope that all door locks
would all wirelessly controlled or

85
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,700
licensed use some action they're not
really lost it all meant for the other

86
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,710
four devices were some of the newest
devices currently available in the

87
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,710
consumer market note about those four
however is that the three of them used

88
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,679
often security and what I mean by that
is you see a picture thereof of one of

89
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:41,039
the devices so the user manual
instruction in the use of the user the

90
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,760
device in a non secure mode and then
buried towards the end of the user

91
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,610
manual is a little snippet this is a
secure mode of this device added to your

92
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,680
network in this way the way we are told
you who reads that far in the device

93
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,469
manager especially have already added
it's your network in working so the

94
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,200
story here is that a yes the protocol
supports encryption many of the devices

95
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,530
currently available

96
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:14,380
don't and the ones that do not always
used by default

97
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:26,339
demonstration of the tool

98
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:38,980
what we have here is to a carafe ones
are defined radios transmit one is used

99
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,079
for or received because they're they're
not duplex of course you didn't change

100
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:46,339
without with whatever other software
defined radio you want to as long as

101
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:51,240
it's compatible with with you radio
chosen because they're fairly cheap

102
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,139
compared to something like a star P

103
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:59,259
over here I have small z-wave network
with just a couple devices for

104
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:04,670
demonstration and then over here is the
lamp install out of my room just for you

105
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,800
guys and it is connected to another
z-wave I stand here that you can really

106
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:19,508
see because of the shower so for time
sake I'm going to skip the the network

107
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:24,220
discovery portion because it really is
just passive scanning until traffic is

108
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:30,160
observed and a unique network
identifiers found the home I D 40 wave

109
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,959
and resume skip ahead to the network
enumeration a small network up here

110
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,170
already uneasy stellar using the the
whole idea that we assume that we found

111
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:48,469
their passive scanning so what's going
on right now is we are sending out

112
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,079
broadcast messages that solicit
compulsory acknowledgments from all the

113
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:57,899
devices on the network that are within
range of the suffered by radio so

114
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,410
windows devices acknowledged that
message they're making their presence

115
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,319
known and you see them pop up on the
screen their second year thats Tamil

116
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:13,439
finished with a report

117
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:23,460
so the stand found 50 devices on the
network now that we have the new devices

118
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,010
on the network

119
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:33,090
go ahead interrogate one of them do is a
device that's not configured with

120
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:38,190
encryption at the moment now that the
note I D from the previous can as akin

121
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:44,100
to the the IP address on the local
network for this protocol can device

122
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,470
number three or interrogated by summer
three what's going on right now as I'm

123
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:53,100
sending out a host of messages
requesting specific information from no

124
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,660
source authentication in the z-wave
protocol is not used the devices will

125
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,800
happily oblige and send that information
back to me and then the tools going to

126
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,660
convert it into a human-readable format
as you can see there on the screen

127
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,959
I'm so the device that we just and you
can see is a narrow text marks which six

128
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,060
below that you can see all the the
software and firmware version

129
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,099
information

130
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,580
followed by a list of all the
functionality of this device and then

131
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,880
there are the bottom you see the the
basic status of the device which is

132
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,140
currently off the continuous scanning
the configuration settings for that

133
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,270
takes more time we have for this this
presentation but I think you get the

134
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:36,199
idea so now just in case you're curious
and two to make a particular manufacture

135
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,790
a little bit we're going to interrogate
a device that is currently set up with

136
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,430
encryption right now you can see the
difference again it's gonna send the

137
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:52,500
same stream of requests for this device
asking for a specific information and

138
00:12:52,500 --> 00:13:00,890
you can see that that this device we
still get the information that the

139
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:06,069
manufacture we see that it say in a text
I range and five same with the

140
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,660
some information for this software
version firmware versions and

141
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,329
capabilities down the bottom of the
basic status is unknown because there's

142
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,370
encryption we can't figure out if this
devices running on whatever understated

143
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:24,010
his escape the configuration stand again
it's so gifted but in this case it would

144
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:29,240
show that it was unknown because it's so
you might be asking yourself at this

145
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,570
point no we're more than halfway into
this presentation will what the hell

146
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,220
does this have to do with breaking balls
briskly I'm sure that's what a lot of

147
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:45,550
you came here for so naturally the easy
way of Dorset is geared more towards

148
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:51,420
reconnaissance however the messages used
to control or controlled devices is very

149
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,000
similar to the messages used just to
interrogate the devices are actually

150
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,780
really easy to control these devices
with suffered radios so naturally once

151
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:08,339
you have the ability to wirelessly
control advised the next question is

152
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,580
where can I break something and that's
what we set out to do we want to see

153
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,640
having access to a wireless automation
system how quickly can we break out

154
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:25,770
something like industrial source
involved in residential CFLs as he

155
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:31,439
brings back and went kinda zoom out
we've been looking at the way of kind of

156
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,780
soda straw z-wave as you probably know
is not the only wireless smart energy

157
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:43,209
protocol out there we have a ton of
solutions all them competing and

158
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:49,010
security is is a hot mess to use
something my wife would say so wifi in

159
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:54,970
2001 to 2004 gigahertz band these
protocols are fairly well understood and

160
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:02,270
there are tolls in like Cali Lenox first
blessing Bluetooth ZigBee you have an

161
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,760
outdated version of killer be in Cali

162
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:11,150
criticized gigahertz like like z-wave
Insteon and neutron and these others

163
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,850
that 900 megahertz really helps

164
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:20,230
the range of these devices and so this
is help Seaways take the majority market

165
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:26,100
share for the wireless market and so
what we really want to help contribute

166
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,579
to is the tool sets and in the attack
thinking for these are subject her

167
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:37,810
articles so for what we did here was a
case study these these power switches

168
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,810
are connected to something no one no one
just has them in our house for no reason

169
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,609
they're gonna be used for Christmas
lights and so for the case study here we

170
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:53,959
look at Horace involves in the home
there in a hotel rooms but more

171
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:59,819
interesting are the overhead lights in
in warehouses factories office buildings

172
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:03,790
as smart energy keeps getting plugged
there's been a lot of push on how to

173
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,290
automate this stuff and so even if it's
not a wireless system it's a wired

174
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,319
system that's not secure and we can get
into it we went to figure out how

175
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:20,479
quickly can damage something in the real
world from the network so how do you

176
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,209
break a fluorescent lamp you turn it off
and you turn it on really quickly but

177
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:29,729
it's not as simple as turning on and off
ten times a second and it'll be dead

178
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:35,779
it's actually a little bit tricky so
I'll talk about there is a publication

179
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:40,120
in the Journal of industrial technology
back in 2011 and what they did is they

180
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:46,720
took 35 compaq's less involved and they
cycled them to second power 98 seconds

181
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,550
powered off and they did this over and
over again until they sailed and what

182
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:56,529
they report is a talk about 7,300 cycles
and so if you look at that time from an

183
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:00,380
attack point of view how quickly can
break them that's about twenty that's

184
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,280
pretty good but there are two issues
with that one it couldn't be done with

185
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,709
his single night and that was kind of
our goal and there's also a wide range

186
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:14,760
so what happens when you brake inflation
bulb every once in a while it won't fail

187
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,230
catastrophically it'll just

188
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,809
and that damn limits the current doesn't
have the thermal stress

189
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:24,990
in order to survive for a long time and
that's how you get that long tail of

190
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,860
sixty hours so that the research
question looking for it is how do I

191
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,360
optimizes how quickly is it possible to
breakthroughs involves both the compact

192
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,979
fluorescents in the home and if you have
an industrial control system is

193
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:43,139
compromised how fast we break the
industrial lights the first thing we do

194
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:49,229
research we gotta replicate the results
so we we took eight goals can justify

195
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:56,259
their site had a pocket that we have
evolved and we ran until they failed and

196
00:17:56,259 --> 00:18:01,059
the distribution looks really good
compared to the journal very consistent

197
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:05,600
on the left of these slides you've got a
box plot of the

198
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,949
the distro and then on the on the right
we had a very consistent they were

199
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:17,759
telling the truth so we won't see ok so
how quickly so this is for the compact

200
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,590
fluorescent no one has looked at the
industrial items as far as we can tell

201
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:25,649
how fast it goes well the overhead
lights in industrial settings are not

202
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:29,959
meant to be toggled on and I every time
you go in another room like the complex

203
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:36,440
or essence so that the mean time to
failure is is actually less than six

204
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,820
hours or so so what we do and we broke
those and we tried different patterns

205
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:48,639
and so we tried having each of the cycle
so instead of two seconds on eight

206
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:54,389
seconds off we did 1940 in the
performance improved we were able to

207
00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:59,279
break them much faster so we kept going
in like a kind of alluded to before we

208
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,289
tried cycling you know ten times a
second course without that thermal

209
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:08,970
stress of the device turning on the
light heating up and then you going down

210
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:14,279
without thermal stress the device will
last for its intended life as 30,000

211
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:19,179
hours so what we found a sweet spot to
be was one second on three seconds off

212
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:23,559
that's about as quickly as you can kill
a horse and lamp when it comes to the

213
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:26,020
the other headlines so

214
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:31,520
easily within half a night at the
warehouse is known as a rounder I fell

215
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,020
asleep and the damage is cumulative so
if you perform these cycles you will end

216
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,720
up breaking these bulbs and the cost of
replacement can be substantial and so

217
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,900
going back to the compact fluorescents
we want to see well sure enough magic

218
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,670
number of one second on trees
significantly improved our attack

219
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:57,020
performance so we can break these are
known and again in less than nine hours

220
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:08,139
that's how you take away here as users
when you are connecting things in the

221
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,440
real world to the network to be mindful
of what will happen is someone got into

222
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,730
your system has physical damage is now
possibility in the Internet of Things

223
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:26,800
and then read the manual course and the
manufacturer uses just using corruption

224
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,210
if its wireless encryption and make it
the default period there's no reason not

225
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:47,180
to so easy way is available at the ural
listed there before he began questions

226
00:20:47,180 --> 00:21:04,630
the question was is used for doors as
well so yes there are quite a few z-wave

227
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,930
enabled door locks on the on the market
that's actually one of the one of the

228
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:13,980
big selling points for this protocol is
that the use of door locks using it in a

229
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,830
smart home is one of the first things
that people want to get home I have one

230
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:28,939
of my house they're actually pretty
convenient questions

231
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,080
thank you very much
