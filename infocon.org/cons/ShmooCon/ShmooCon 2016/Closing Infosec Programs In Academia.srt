1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,070
bradbury wake of late has your drinking
all night and then we don't give you a

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:13,099
lunch break sorry for diabetic insulin
outrage and Snickers bars are good

3
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:18,000
streamers thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up
got three films up in only two functions

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,980
of an extra thumb go army

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:29,939
wherever needed to connect I think are
going home to their address the same so

6
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,530
sorry did you have fun yeah he had to
wear cities yeah yeah I got to where I

7
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,790
got new uniform so this the closing
plenary for smoke on this is an

8
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,769
experiment we've been running now for 45
years and the ideas to try to get

9
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:50,480
everybody together and have some
interesting and potentially not

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,949
comfortable discourse around the state
of something in the industry in into the

11
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:59,989
previous four years we pulled the
plenary panel members from the talks

12
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,500
emissions in a lot of like last year a
lot of talks in mass can easily pull

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,300
together to form a scanning and stuff
like that and it was it's been

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,509
interesting in this year nothing really
jumped out on us so we kind of thinking

15
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:15,110
like water interesting challenges what
what's the pointy end of the spear look

16
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,610
like these days and we we came to the
conclusion that you know academia is

17
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,950
playing an increasingly important role
in in cyber security in this space in

18
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,530
general and you know there's been a lot
of changes in academia so we want to get

19
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,099
some academics together so do this up a
little bit more now seeking to say a few

20
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:36,970
words showed reduced our panelists and
then the kicker is in some of these

21
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,899
perilous adventure comedy for and are
familiar with the way it happens I think

22
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:46,840
the gentleman and losses first time he
has not been beaten by small yet but he

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,789
has a big thing of water in front of
them they better have good aim or just

24
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:55,890
better be prepared to get wet so without
tournaments

25
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:16,709
I think where we didn't pitch the
typical high school college grad school

26
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:25,010
factory line production format and
therefore thought that we weren't smart

27
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:34,630
or we arrange capable or we weren't good
enough and we found this community and

28
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,750
we discovered this this other group of
who would cooper also creative and

29
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,250
interesting and exciting and we have the
most intelligent conversations at four

30
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:51,650
in the morning when were half drunk and

31
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:58,269
but I don't think it's sunk into a lot
of us that the work we're doing his

32
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:04,790
research he doesn't have a related work
section you haven't looked at prior art

33
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:11,530
necessarily and you have a decided your
references but its research and finally

34
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:17,680
the academic community is beginning to
recognize that and end their starting

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,549
that can help end we got were incredible
people here I'd like to introduce

36
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:31,970
from the University of Maryland who is
starting a cybersecurity program as well

37
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,319
as doing programming languages and orkut
and systems Architektur great country

38
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,540
who I I'm sure many of you have to have
seen his wonderful talks and

39
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:49,179
presentations here as well as elsewhere
has developed a incredible program at

40
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:56,489
west point that has really contributed a
lot to our community who runs the

41
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,260
Graduate cybersecurity program at the
University of Maryland Baltimore County

42
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:06,019
and it was a great pleasure to introduce
my own adviser mack plays for the

43
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:12,350
University of Pennsylvania thank you

44
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:29,930
I'm just gonna wing it to moderate this
panel which is good because I have no

45
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:37,270
idea what I'm doing here so this is
supposed to be a panel on cybersecurity

46
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:46,150
and and information security education
and how we shall we do it and I my

47
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,669
background is I got my PhD and had to
get a job and I went and got the best

48
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:58,800
job in the world which was a researcher
at Bell Labs and I all the pellets alums

49
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,160
and it's great because it's it's it's
you know they they basically pay you and

50
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,600
you do whatever you want you to research
and that was a terrific job and I

51
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,570
decided to switch into security full
time when I started there and you know

52
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:19,580
just started doing it coming from a kind
of general systems background and I

53
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:25,990
spent a dozen years at the labs this
kind of doing doing security staff

54
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:33,070
coming from my background as a general
systems researcher and cryptography

55
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:41,300
person and you know then the labs blew
up and I had to go get a real job and

56
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,700
the closest thing to a real job I could
find was a professor and I went to the

57
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:52,840
University of Pennsylvania and coming
from the labs professor is a real job

58
00:05:52,840 --> 00:06:02,560
that's the amazing amazing things the
and you know I would teach some classes

59
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,350
in things and I graduate classes in in
in thing you know is specific things

60
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,190
like cryptography and I'd advise
graduate students in advising PhD

61
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,710
students is basically an apprenticeship
program so you basically are just having

62
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:22,000
people work with you are under research
that you're doing and you know every now

63
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,490
and then I like the undergraduate
operating systems class

64
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:33,400
hurry now and then they would come along
and say hey you know Macs due to

65
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,599
security maybe you should teach you know
the security class no classes

66
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:44,150
undergraduate class insecurity and my
reaction is bullshit because I have no

67
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:51,650
idea what should be in that class the
end as far as I can tell the preparation

68
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:59,130
for doing research in security is
largely you know know a lot about

69
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:06,319
computer science broadly and have kind
of an evil mind and you know we have all

70
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,419
these other courses about computer
science broadly and you can either

71
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:13,109
having evil mind or you don't

72
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,690
so I'm not sure what to do and then I
look at what other people teach and you

73
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:23,400
know look at these courses and the you
know largely what we're doing is we're

74
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,698
taking other areas of computer science
and just kind of looking at them with a

75
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:35,259
security fence and you know maybe we
should have that security bent in the

76
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:39,509
other courses in the first place maybe
that's why we're in the mess that we're

77
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:43,520
we're instead of having people D
specialists in security maybe computer

78
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,330
science generalists should be should be
thinking about these things to keep us

79
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,930
out of the mess that were that were not
working right now sarah's October 1

80
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,389
fortunately couldn't be here on this
panel has been been been doing some

81
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:02,830
terrific work in integrating security
not as a specialty but as a general

82
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:14,000
parts of the curriculum so fortunately I
was asked to moderate this panel and

83
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,740
mostly I'm gonna sit here and take notes
about what other people do so we have

84
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:25,479
three terrific panelists who you you've
heard from we have you know Jeff Foster

85
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:31,139
at University of Maryland College Park
we have

86
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,630
have great Conte who I think everybody
everyone knows I will say one word about

87
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:41,099
great content which is as far as I'm
concerned he is one of only a couple of

88
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:50,190
people on earth were license to use the
word cyber on ironically the and Richard

89
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:58,260
porno at UMBC so what went on to lead
off with introduced themselves more

90
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,500
deeply than than than we haven't felt a
little bit about how they came to where

91
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,720
they are in security and lead off with
the question what the hell do we teach

92
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:17,850
people in a security ok all right so i'm
i'm Jack foster from the American

93
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:25,690
College Park Metro right away from here
which is very good morning so so my

94
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,190
background is actually come from sort of
programming languages of engineering

95
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:35,269
background which gradually compilers
with the research you haven't seen

96
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:40,320
anything that works on like source code
including detecting security

97
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,050
vulnerabilities in it so that's how I
got interested in security and I've been

98
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,990
working on security I guess actually
ever since I've been doing some work in

99
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,570
insecurity

100
00:09:51,570 --> 00:10:01,940
security so I say what I want to say to
crises in the controversial may be more

101
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:11,019
fun this way that's good because I don't
want to so you said that maybe we can

102
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,709
integrate security a little bit into all
the other courses in an undergraduate

103
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:21,369
computer science program my feeling is
this is hopeless because there is too

104
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,029
much other stuff in computer science
right i mean the field is awesomer

105
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,939
taking over the world said the
University of Maryland

106
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:35,310
25 and 27,000 undergrads we have 2400
computer science undergraduate majors

107
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:40,050
like nine percent of the university
population is doing cs3 now is in SE

108
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,089
sane and not everybody I mean ok so
maybe everybody needs to know something

109
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:48,050
about security but not everybody is
going to be up at a level where you are

110
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:53,689
and be able to come to work on and and
participate in this kind of event so I

111
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,790
think there's too much other stuff in
computer science to increase security

112
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,390
everywhere you can put a little but it's
still not be something that you

113
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,240
specialize in

114
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,079
alright so that's that's one thing I
want to say I want to say is this really

115
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:13,420
technical crowd right there are so many
people out there though that our

116
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,519
technical and that care about
cybersecurity because we've taken over

117
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,750
the world and are stuck with it so
computing is everywhere everybody is

118
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,240
realizing this people are finally
starting to push computing into K

119
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,950
through 12 education rates are for a
while is only like the best school

120
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,459
districts in the world did this now
everybody is realizing that has to do

121
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,760
this so we've taken over the world and
now we need to deal with it

122
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,170
there are people that wanted to worry
about policy legal issues there people

123
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:42,939
that want to do it

124
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:48,750
psychology and etcetera so how do we
deal with all those people when we have

125
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,810
a highly technical subject raining all
the skills and that was talking about

126
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,729
all these people they carry them I have
good ideas but they don't really have

127
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,649
the background what the heck do we do
with them

128
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:07,029
this isn't fair I'm asking questions
let's go with it so I'm going county and

129
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:11,149
I think like many of you I was always
wired toward security they don't

130
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,899
necessarily realize it and realize
there's a tribe surrounding it's about

131
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:22,779
fifty years ago to my first time in
black hats and community around it like

132
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:29,430
2012 follow wondering that if we should
actually create wives cyber licenses

133
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:36,550
that people are then people would say to
be productive octave I wonder

134
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,719
approaching peak cyber in that

135
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,170
there are certain people that I'm to
friends and one of them came to me one

136
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:51,800
day the stock market and claimed to me
that they were going to become a day

137
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,750
trader and mother came to me at the
height of the real estate and proclaimed

138
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,699
to me that they were going to become a
candidate past their their their agent's

139
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:06,709
license either one of these people
should ever in any possible universe a

140
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:14,160
day trader or real estate agent and I i
see small people places around the

141
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:22,319
country that I wonder if they should be
coming tiber places and I see a lot of

142
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:23,269
that everywhere

143
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,740
everything pretty much every place on
the planet some people have long storm

144
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,560
trackers and they should be the ones
leading and maybe but I do see that

145
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,469
question and wonderful approaching peak
summer I also see that this there's a

146
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,389
distinction between information security
in this thing that is information

147
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:46,850
security we worry about protecting
systems do things like red teaming and

148
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:55,879
get a glimpse of large-scale conflict
with the large-scale the idea of nations

149
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:59,389
fighting nations that skill I wonder if
there's something bigger this this thing

150
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:03,959
that is cyber operations I also see that
its multidisciplinary so we're talking

151
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:09,040
about just inside a computer science
curriculum and betting it I think that

152
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,779
we need to look across virtually every
discipline has an intersection and it's

153
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:17,620
it's hard chemistry is the one and try
some people in here that figure this out

154
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,740
but I haven't figured out chemistry but
every other just see an intersection and

155
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,759
there are efficiencies that you can use
if you have to do an exercise in class

156
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:32,279
you know you could make it on securities
there are ways to be efficient things

157
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:39,170
don't necessarily have to fall off the
plate the final thing I'll say is one

158
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,899
thing that concerns me is ethical
aspects of what we're learning dangerous

159
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:51,679
skills and people who learns her skills
soldiers police officers about we have

160
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,439
dinner skills are you played in a way
that may cause I promise and how to

161
00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:03,290
embed into our students respect to those
skills and also give them safe areas to

162
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,149
practice and learn without worst-case
scenario

163
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:11,990
kurtz from Apocalypse Now you go rogue
and start your own private Merck Merck

164
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,750
army and get involved and complex so
that's something that would probably be

165
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:23,769
bad pretty bad for the West Point
Program as far as what we should teach

166
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:28,970
interdisciplinary across all disciplines
I would say and of course things like

167
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,579
secure coding I think we have a long way
to go

168
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:37,638
adversarial thinking itself in the mind
and then the privacy and ethics for sure

169
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:52,750
you to go now I'm rich 10 director
graduate cybersecurity program at UMBC

170
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,309
assistant director of our center for
cybersecurity I came into the field

171
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:59,750
twenty twenty years ago

172
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,389
being one of those generalists in
computing I was very good with computers

173
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:05,100
as a kid

174
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,790
program in the old apple too basic and
whatnot moves in the College in London

175
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:16,910
network administration and/or the Novell
Netware for the ESCO

176
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,829
it seems to grow up and about six years
ago I finish my PhD I moved into

177
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:28,329
academia as a way of sharing lessons
learned from my career in industry from

178
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:34,290
the NOC engineer all the way up to the
CSO kinda give back and hopefully fix or

179
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,449
help the next generation of
practitioners not make the same mistakes

180
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,020
we did that got us into many situations
were in today

181
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,720
tribute to much of what my car parts of
the panel said but I want to emphasize

182
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:53,770
that there is no magic wand to produce a
quality information security cyber

183
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,819
practitioner emission peaks either and I
think that's actually a very valid

184
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,360
analogy I see students looking to move
into cyber security that have no

185
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,429
experience in technology at all the only
security experience might be changing

186
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:13,570
your Facebook password once a year
that's not enough to be a practitioner

187
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:17,369
they don't know the basis of networks
and computing encoding and things like

188
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:24,649
that how can you defend a network is how
good or how you structure one build one

189
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:30,720
so we have to producing qualified
practitioners

190
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,860
educational problem but it's also a
workforce development problems become

191
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:41,090
politicized we need jobs we create jobs
is the new industry and people are

192
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,570
rushing into it because that's where the
money is the jobs are but not everybody

193
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,290
can just get a degree in Press to you
now as cyber security practitioner

194
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,230
doesn't work that way either have those
technical foundational skills of

195
00:17:53,230 --> 00:18:00,160
computing talked about those skills how
do you put those that knowledge into

196
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,980
practice in the real world in books
Martin common sense stupid will not help

197
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:13,380
our career field long-term effective
practitioner we've we've said already

198
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,180
that the field is interdisciplinary and
I see that even my campus programs far

199
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,330
outside of planes are interested in
cybersecurity Media Studies wants to put

200
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:31,080
words in their curriculum to expose
dunes to their colleagues across country

201
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,760
in the rhetoric Department rhetoric
looking at various security related

202
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,140
aspects not necessarily technical but
broader cultural legal policy issues so

203
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,810
this is an interdisciplinary field I
want the obstacles we have to overcome

204
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,889
is

205
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,020
the perception that yesterday's big part
of it

206
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:57,240
techies we need not have some free she
Asian of technology to make effective

207
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,350
decisions at the national and
international level

208
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:09,959
finally I think matt said before
education in any discipline occurs

209
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,660
outside the classroom as well

210
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,480
the best security practitioners I know
never took computer science or computer

211
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,530
security courses they in high school and
college were on their own they coated

212
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,430
inmates and cons went to 2200 means went
to twenty things got their names and in

213
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,900
credits injuries applications

214
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:35,850
drive and desire to learn and grow and
push the limits it's very hard to teach

215
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:43,270
that inculcated but haven't spark you
won't have that drive and closest thing

216
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,590
they just go to a program and
undergraduate graduate program and

217
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,189
become president making six figures in
the security space it's a misnomer

218
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,820
doesn't work that way

219
00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:00,050
ok so as the moderator I just want to
point out that all three of you said

220
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:04,500
some really smart interesting things
that that I like to think about but none

221
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:15,340
of you answered the damn question so let
me just let me just point out that you

222
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,770
know when we started out i mean all of
us came to this and i think im speaking

223
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,080
matters for the panel but I almost
everybody in the room we all came from

224
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,189
this week grew up in this generation we
got this informally great week we were

225
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:32,800
general computer scientists or whatever
whatever our background was in we

226
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,940
learned computer security on the street
and beginning its under our fingernails

227
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,160
and despite

228
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,730
bye bye bye doing and that's a terrific
way to do that and at the time that we

229
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,960
started in this field we actually had to
make the case that some days security is

230
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,370
going to be important and everybody kind
of laughed at us and maybe humored us

231
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,620
and then all of a sudden it happens and
one of the ways it happened is that

232
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:06,610
those of us who figured out how to do
this informally aren't enough to solve

233
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:12,330
the problem that we've got we're
suddenly being asked to come out with

234
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:20,860
systemic ways of reproducing ourselves
that we haven't quite figured out how to

235
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,449
do and you know one of the things I find
interesting is that if you look at what

236
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,160
how people get trained to do this it's
different in every school it's you know

237
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,560
everybody has different recommendations
about but what you're supposed to do

238
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,450
here we're really you know that at its
infancy and I think one of the things

239
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,990
observations that I often make his
security people we might not want to be

240
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,910
too proud of this rate we're in the only
branch of computer science that's

241
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,550
failing right I mean I've got all my
friends into graphics and the new

242
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,220
robotics and they do

243
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:59,120
algorithms and they're doing all this
amazing stuff and yet our networks and

244
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,719
our security gets worse and worse and
worse every every year we're being

245
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,050
called on to fix that problem

246
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:13,450
at scale not on the individual level
where extraordinary people figure it out

247
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:18,020
on their own and and do great things how
do we fix this problem at scales so in

248
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:46,450
other words you get a second chance to
answer the question

249
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:58,890
problem you know we should be more
interdisciplinary and stage you do have

250
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:03,120
a pipeline problem like you've got a
pipeline problem within education I hear

251
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,669
people saying let's teach kids how to
code everybody's gotta learn how to code

252
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,770
which means Robidoux how to code and
then over on the other side you have my

253
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,730
literacies people saying let's or not
they are going to learn how to blog and

254
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,160
you second life in press the right
button in Microsoft Word in soon there's

255
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,660
a big gap in the middle where we're not
teaching them anything at all about

256
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,810
networks and one of my goals this year
engines and studies on how people

257
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,050
understand how networks work their
mental models of what I want to do is be

258
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,960
able to get that street in front of
education practitioners and say you're

259
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,310
ignoring networks and we need to
understand that works and I see this

260
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,490
people say to me you don't really need
to do that because we don't need to know

261
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:46,300
how r plumbing works and I say let
success that code is law if this law we

262
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,240
do need to know how congress works you
teach civics so we should be teaching

263
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,430
people I know but I'm happy to continue

264
00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:11,710
again

265
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:19,440
ok so so so so we we offer some
commuting to classes so there's a

266
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,140
computer network security and
cryptography it's really two classes

267
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:30,290
that are like this and you can all guess
what I would say the problem with having

268
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:36,980
more stuff is gonna say it's a failure
of the field ok I claimed that there's

269
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,110
too much packing breaking stuff

270
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:46,340
thinking that that is and not enough
here's how we build secure systems

271
00:24:46,340 --> 00:25:00,300
house computer and network security
different from computers and networks

272
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:07,510
good if you can run a computer network
and security computers network you're

273
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:11,430
doing basic security for doing it right
so I think the two are very closely

274
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:19,520
related but you can't do computer
security computers do we have to look at

275
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:29,320
the year ago then we will look at the
curriculum number one and build on what

276
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,490
you said about not focusing on the
tactical had a degree in computer

277
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:40,930
science should focus on those basics
basics now will include things like

278
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,670
secure software development in your
programming courses in your networking

279
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:49,670
classes so you know just having one
module on how to hack a network you're

280
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:54,730
throwing in security-conscious along the
way as part of the curriculum will build

281
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,420
security and development mantras

282
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,610
do the same thing for curriculum and
injected weekend along the way it was

283
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,990
not just an ad on the very end and doing
that

284
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:10,600
underground level i think is great first
step and then they specialize in

285
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:27,959
offensive rebounds of schools follow and
you have to those programs at the

286
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,600
undergraduate level if you want people
to care

287
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:36,139
have to be listened to the meditation
panels probably the least fun things you

288
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:41,480
can do the technologist but it's getting
involved with helping rewrite that then

289
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,070
that's the doctrine the dog mother

290
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:52,450
calls from there so that's how the
system

291
00:26:52,450 --> 00:27:14,260
you're providing us and that's
interesting so I'm kind of hearing is

292
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:21,690
maybe we shouldn't maybe we should take
a bold stand and say security is not a

293
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,230
specialization that you should do as an
undergrad for undergraduates I disagree

294
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:32,280
with that ok this is just a point to
feuding has a variety of different areas

295
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:39,670
I am an AC I worked with ACM I am a TV
we have computer science we have

296
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:43,980
information technology we have
information systems in a wide variety of

297
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,290
other areas there's no reason security
can't stand on its own

298
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:52,860
the perception that I see is a computer
science is trying to fill everything

299
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,320
computer science is worried about the
operating systems

300
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,860
worried about the communications and
it's a wonderful place to be but what

301
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:06,270
are you doing about the business what
are you doing about the and that's where

302
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:12,480
information technology stood up over ten
years ago and so within information

303
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,960
technology or bring an author of
Computer Science and Information

304
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,300
Technology had to leave security can
stand on its own and can stand under a

305
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:28,740
variety of disciplines yes need to
integrate the software security we need

306
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,430
to integrate good behavior within the
other classes and I can I believe they

307
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:39,050
can be brought in several areas but I
also believe very strongly that it can

308
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,800
be done well and we stood up a program
and we thought it for ten years and our

309
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,389
students are being hired

310
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:50,379
well accepted within industry given that
I think the best thing that this body

311
00:28:50,379 --> 00:29:07,879
can do work with ACM to become a Peavey
like was was suggested sorry season but

312
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:13,639
more importantly find your local
colleges and become advisers help them

313
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:19,549
to understand what the industry once put
in a plug like I've done the Avett

314
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:25,149
accreditation stuff in in my university
and it's you know it's just as much fun

315
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:31,268
as being on a standard but you know you
have real impact so thank you also for

316
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,289
pointing out there is a microphone so
you can either send a one bit message by

317
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:39,739
throwing the ball and hitting somebody
in the head or you can send a higher

318
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:44,149
bandwidth message message by using the
microphone please so I've been teaching

319
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:51,289
for a while and I've always wanted to be
a teacher but I can't do school

320
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:58,408
undergrad right now I'm working on what
are you guys doing about sixteen the

321
00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:03,209
deficit insecurity teachers because
right now they're all going to blackhat

322
00:30:03,209 --> 00:30:12,320
and DEFCON and teaching there and making
a lot of money I see quite a bit with my

323
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,109
program because all my faculty regimens
and they're coming from the outside

324
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:21,289
world coming to teach in the evenings on
the big problems I see and this is

325
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:26,789
actually one of my main beach with
academia is to teach a certain levels

326
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:31,869
have the appropriate degree bachelor's
master's degree there are people have a

327
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:36,039
love to teach my program that are
awesome their hackers in the truest

328
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:40,950
sense they've been 23 years experience
and a bachelor's degree I can use them

329
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:47,109
and that's it that's a tragedy to have
that talent washed away and ignored

330
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:48,780
because of how academia structure

331
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:55,370
other ways around that yes and we didn't
size tibetan in small doses but I think

332
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:59,780
it harkens back to just the need for
some people were plucking instructors

333
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:06,490
industry just one of my $2,000 and teach
pours it happens and I think the best

334
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,190
within the seizure of developing this
talent on the chair track we have folks

335
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:16,460
that are part in academia 467 10 years
not prompt Tues academia industry moves

336
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,010
so quickly

337
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:22,080
academia doesn't so the folks who were
coming to my program and muscling in

338
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,449
academia generally there in this world
daily basis they're doing the stuff and

339
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:37,580
taking the experience in the classroom
guess it was a good question

340
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:49,060
different fields such as systems
engineering or formal discipline and

341
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:53,460
that security engineering is not formal
discipline should it be what are your

342
00:31:53,460 --> 00:32:01,550
views on making it a formal discipline
house we go about doing that ok I'm no

343
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:08,280
idea the naval academy is doing
something to try to take cybersecurity

344
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:15,740
make a call that cyber science standards
and accreditation about the formal

345
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:25,140
regiment I don't know what a weird
question but they have someone to do

346
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:32,880
that there is working that they're
looking for better names and cyber

347
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:39,400
science him so you have some ideas I
mean they did survey they just called

348
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,720
cyber takeout science and Alzheimer's
over yeah I'm so they are looking for

349
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,910
ideas there is a marketing aspect to
this you have two solid so this is a

350
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:56,120
soapbox moment and we talked a lot about
education at the collegiate level but at

351
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,989
the intermediate level for middle school
and high schools are no one's ever cyber

352
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,380
patriot program go home

353
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,080
sign up to be a mint or because they're
so many teams out there that need the

354
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,939
technical expertise don't have it I
meant or for high school in Virginia

355
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,520
wonderful kids really want to learn it
it's a great way to get in and do the

356
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:24,899
teaching if you don't have the
credentials to be a collegiate so it's

357
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:30,599
so another issue that's coming up I mean
I think the major issues computer

358
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,229
science doesn't count

359
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:36,559
other sciences in high school so at
least miss a maryland you can't use it

360
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:44,769
for the same kind of requirements even
use physics chemistry doesn't count in

361
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:49,589
the same way so until we fix it so that
there's an expectation that everybody

362
00:33:49,589 --> 00:33:54,080
high schools gonna get some kind of
education have access to it by teachers

363
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,689
that are accredited by the state that's
like super important for high school

364
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,719
education teachers have to be approved
by the state we're gonna have these

365
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:06,859
sorts of problems so where you're coming
from you know tell people in your local

366
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:12,538
governments part of everybody's
education so this is your diversity

367
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:23,849
moment are too so it's really great that
people in the audience here that battle

368
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:25,510
with you

369
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:29,750
grassroots education and and whatnot I
come from where I spent some time at the

370
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:34,210
white house you know in dealing with
cyber security policy was recently

371
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:40,049
reviewing an NSC memo talking about
developing a cyber ROTC getting people

372
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:43,639
into the workforce what I'm finding is
an actual lack of knowledge of the

373
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:49,859
leadership in that arena so unless you
know what you want you can't teach it

374
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:54,159
and therefore you have this issue with
irons you know a lot of you know that

375
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,380
there's a grand comment that the
government is going to hire tens of

376
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:04,760
thousands of cyber experts but it's very
ill defined so what is your solution is

377
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,690
to working with those people that are in
demand it's great that they go out to

378
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,079
industry and the government and the kind
of keep them all off until they get

379
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:17,510
frustrated and move on but without you

380
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,890
leading demanding what they want coming
up with standards but not with

381
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,600
certifications come out with basically a
body of knowledge that as you mentioned

382
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,160
before in your interest

383
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:38,200
qualify somebody to be a trusted member
person so we need to breathe this is

384
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,500
this audiences to see these types of
people's need to use them to grow more

385
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:57,470
debris them not a satisfactory answer
you'll have your marching orders when

386
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,520
you're looking for a plumber's you make
sure that they have a bachelor's degree

387
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,970
or a welder where an electrician or a
carpenter any other sort of trade

388
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:12,020
reaching this in the wrong way we should
not require anybody who wants to be a

389
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:17,509
professional to go and spend $40,000 go
deeply into debt and get a piece of

390
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:21,360
paper that says they are good at sitting
in a classroom for four years we should

391
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,770
be following the same sort of model that
the treats you should be getting people

392
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,780
basic education in the classroom so they
know they're asking the home ground and

393
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,570
then we need to apprentice them to a
professional working in the field so

394
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:39,360
that at the end of a four-year program
they have a good job they're not so

395
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:47,470
deeply in debt that they want to commit
suicide and they know what they're doing

396
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:54,560
I agree with what you're saying but I'm
not sure that any of it is unique to the

397
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,330
security ethnic do this right i mean
computer science is one of those deals

398
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:04,080
in which lots of people without any
formal education do just fine and that's

399
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:10,340
seems to be truth or secure as true for
security as it is operating systems or

400
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,740
you know building you know other other
things whatever those other computer

401
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:21,680
scientists do one of the reasons the
purpose of education is to give people a

402
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,980
definite path where you go through it
and at the end of it you get some skills

403
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:31,590
in our society has this problem where we
kind of over value and often require

404
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:36,450
that one particular narrow path but it
is a path that works where at least some

405
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:41,629
subset of people it's a good way of sort
of scaling up knowledge introducing new

406
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:46,390
people we seem to know how to do that
for other areas of computer science I'm

407
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:54,750
not sure where yet for what we should do
for the security aspects of it also

408
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,160
driven by market demand right where the
where the jobs are

409
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,500
if the companies are hiring people and
and I think we've all felt that

410
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,910
constrain

411
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:08,430
trying to hire people on an academic
positions are pretty tightly bound

412
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,250
you've heard the stories of government
and all comes down to higher authorities

413
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,540
and what they can hire what the beach
are people look for and filter if you

414
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,619
can hire them at all so sometimes you
can work around that sometimes it's the

415
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:26,950
market demand can help drive so I think
the trades are also a great analogy but

416
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:30,220
the problem is we don't we don't know we
need right we don't know what somebody

417
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,990
that's funny at the same level as a
plumber but in information security we

418
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:38,700
don't know exactly what they should be
like so we're erring on the side of you

419
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,770
need this super duper you need to be the
world's expert in information security

420
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,020
to do anything in it right and obviously
that's not true long-term we don't want

421
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,270
that we want people to be at all
different levels right

422
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:57,690
I thought for you folks we're talking
about using the family was talking about

423
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:01,900
it and also gentlemen about the trades
interesting concept let me suggest that

424
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,570
we're very very busily learning how to
better polished the brass on the deck of

425
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:10,590
the Titanic and we're teaching our most
inmates how to be better at this

426
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,810
inveterate that but we're not addressing
what I think is one of the critical

427
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:18,279
spellings in gaps right now her
educational structure is how do you

428
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,470
teach that Captain the wheelhouse not to
drive into the side of a gigantic

429
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:28,930
iceberg and so all of us a lot of us are
really good technically you're gonna be

430
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,279
really good technically and that's our
highest aspirations to be the ultra uber

431
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,740
senior hyper security analyst awesome
but we're not doing a really good job of

432
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,479
training the four stars in the CEOs in
the board members and ultimately the

433
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,090
members of Congress and even in the
white house those decision makers who

434
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,580
are responsible for the future of this
country and our future of all of our

435
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,779
industries so whatever even thinking
about in terms of being able to educate

436
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,620
those folks they might not be native
speakers but they've figured out of his

437
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,810
stuff out before we've got to address
that we're all going down with the ship

438
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,570
together it's twenty years

439
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:06,190
information security recognized as a
critical function of corporate America

440
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:11,080
computer security was always part in the
basement somewhere and now has become

441
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:16,049
real recognizes something that companies
have riske's even they've made it into a

442
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:21,380
business understanding that CEOs their
boards understand and agree that said

443
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:30,930
there's people who don't understand our
4th Avenue

444
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:55,000
so I know but now it's like a hotel size
bars of soap box

445
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:10,720
so one thing I was teaching kids how to
code the teaching who's teaching the

446
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,230
teachers there are no qualified teachers
in a lot of these places that they're

447
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:23,580
talking really failed to boost revenue
you also see you you're seeing green

448
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:29,000
computer systems and networks computer
security and network security

449
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,040
why is there a difference

450
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:37,250
building secure networks should be what
we teach there should not be a way to do

451
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:44,290
this don't teach people it should be
something you had built into the

452
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:49,330
beginning and yet we're still teaching
rap ways of doing things it shouldn't be

453
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:53,319
that I should be separate fields should
be intrinsic to just a pure science in

454
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:03,730
general and the third thing two things
really

455
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:09,790
there's a lot of other fields look at
the Internet of Things Are are now you

456
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:14,720
know putting stuff online doing things
without consider consulting security

457
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,700
people that i think is a lot of a lot of
the blame ourselves for not solving

458
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:25,450
these problems will known as coming to
us asking to help make sure we do these

459
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:29,460
things right in the first place so it's
a matter of integrating security and

460
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:35,340
everything and not taking it personally
when people do stupid things without

461
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:48,570
talking to us I think a lot of it comes
down to misaligned incentives I mean the

462
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:54,410
reasons why the Internet of Things stack
can be these things can be rushed to

463
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:59,279
market and they built on site laters and
a half after effects and in academia why

464
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,420
aren't people putting the senate's their
incentives are online and his tenure

465
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,830
whatever their job security and they
don't have to and it's more work so

466
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:17,720
trying to address those who is part of
the problem so I didn't really have a

467
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:26,930
challenging thing to say but I wanted to
students who got used to come here and

468
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:39,129
computer science classes at all and then
this program that teachers have

469
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,210
criticized the middle school girls but
it's like really difficult to know about

470
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,730
a find any of those things and I've
always been interested in Computer

471
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:51,960
Science or insecurity but I didn't get
into until this year last year because

472
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,069
when I went to college they told me that
there was nothing you could do

473
00:43:55,069 --> 00:43:59,650
professionally they told me that you can
major in there and so I just decided to

474
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:04,119
do regular old computer science and I
think it's it's a serious problem just

475
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:07,700
getting people to know that it's
possible because there are a lot of

476
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:13,089
programs that do exist and have acted
for the most be doing them but people

477
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:16,720
who want to security I think our people
who are really motivated people and so

478
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,930
we all knew that it was possible for us
to do I think more students would be

479
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:29,440
interested in doing it was really
difficult to get the word out so this

480
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,720
was about almost exactly a year ago I
met a bunch of hackers at a convention

481
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,240
and on a related convention and they
they had a panel unhappy and how long it

482
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,299
is in the media and I went to it and
they were like no he totally do this in

483
00:44:41,299 --> 00:44:45,720
real life and they told me about other
Meetups in my city which is Chicago and

484
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,140
went to those and I got to learn a lot
of stuff from them so I think that one

485
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,279
of the best things that people can do is
to go out and tell people that it

486
00:44:52,280 --> 00:45:03,340
actually is possible because that's how
I'm here

487
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:11,300
so I'm really I continue to be struck by
the pipeline problems think of it just

488
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:16,030
as the facts you know think of us as at
the inception of the Gutenberg press

489
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:20,050
suddenly there's this brand new thing
and nobody knows how to use it and it's

490
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:24,190
about to absolutely turn everything over
messin with peoples incentives like Greg

491
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,500
said you know your overturning existing
publishers who describe things out by

492
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,840
hand so and then we don't have people we
don't have a method to get all the

493
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,470
adults alive who didn't have chances in
school much less the teachers were

494
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,250
teaching the kids who do have a chance
to school we just have this massive

495
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:43,320
massive fraud problem and so you know
there are more structural things I think

496
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,320
we can do more things with respect you
guys I do think trade is an interesting

497
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,740
idea but what we've been seeing in trade
is what trade has been standing up to

498
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,299
this has been kind of a different shape
of things like for example in Europe

499
00:45:55,300 --> 00:46:01,720
hackers where people come and the
program's insofar was run the program

500
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:07,149
allows you get to go through high school
for free you apprentice with a somebody

501
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,420
is currently working in the field and
that's a big part of it is like this

502
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:14,390
barrier between the actual work in the
field is moving so fast like how can

503
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:18,670
even get back in academia so you're
friends with these people and your time

504
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:24,170
there is paid for by a company that
offers to hire you get out I'm wondering

505
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:29,520
from my site in education continuing to
argue that leg computer coding is not

506
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:35,290
its own discipline it is writing its
just writing in order to be empowered to

507
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:39,080
be a literate human being at this point
in time people need to know how to code

508
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,880
and so we should be making that case to
literacy educators but for you guys as

509
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,650
academics how do you think we could take
on these sort of industry apprenticeship

510
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,280
models that are out there how could be
helpful what changes can be made within

511
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,140
academia itself to make more space for
things like that there there was

512
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,680
blushing

513
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:06,299
the short answer is to continue
partnering with industry where possible

514
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,850
to have them mentors students in the
classroom through various practicum

515
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:15,610
seminars give them good experiences on
internships and co-ops essentially take

516
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:19,320
the existing model of internships in
partnerships to the next level are more

517
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,300
expensive basis to take advantage of
those particular areas like the school

518
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:30,230
you're talking about the framework sorry
there were other

519
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:34,530
I'm also a professor of computer science
at the University Maryland and West say

520
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:38,430
that a lot of the amazing learning that
happens on the university campus

521
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:42,750
actually doesn't occur in classrooms
students go off they do side projects

522
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:47,380
they do group projects they get excited
by stuff we'd love to have some shrewd

523
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:53,660
kann ich talks given that shook on we'd
love to have some people come and lead

524
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:57,560
students doing some amazing projects
getting them excited security so don't

525
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,460
think you have to fix or replace the
university curriculum they're all sorts

526
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:05,750
of issues with totally transforming
integrating there's lots of learning it

527
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,610
happens everywhere including on
university campuses beyond the

528
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,620
undergraduate curriculum and I'd love to
have some you guys get more involved

529
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:17,359
that's what we're exciting students
about doing things not mean that I don't

530
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,720
know that point that a lot of what we
can do as academics is not just

531
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,859
curriculum but what kind of culture we
foster right and that's that's that's a

532
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:32,200
really good point also maryland is way
over represented here on this

533
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:41,759
so I have to resume Hopkins in Comp Sci
I was not eligible the end take the

534
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,780
professional engineering exams because
it wasn't recognized you think that one

535
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,950
you think that academia could move
professionalization into computer

536
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:56,430
security by actually forcing it into the
de and with that help it you can do it

537
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:05,799
actually touched on in his entry which
is the fact that we have the

538
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:12,030
certification the end these new what I
refer to as cyber putting those that are

539
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:15,310
coming up all over the place because
there's a lot of money being thrown it

540
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:22,190
right now so if we move this sort of
certification to the curriculum how do

541
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:29,250
you recognize what is good from what is
bad because the figures could interpret

542
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:37,809
even more cynical

543
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:45,719
so it's easy answers yes it will help in
her and so it's actually the same debate

544
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:49,499
rages within software engineering
software engineering me something that

545
00:49:49,499 --> 00:49:54,689
you need to be certified engineer
refresh tears and lots of arguments on

546
00:49:54,689 --> 00:49:59,180
all sides and I don't know the answer
this one is just tell me nobody knows

547
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,390
what to do

548
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,959
there's movement going on and just
getting security into the undergraduate

549
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:08,868
curriculum as a starting point and these
things progressing apace and you can

550
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:12,279
push it doesn't happen overnight

551
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:22,299
think math standards bodies analogy was
so I believe earlier you guys mentioned

552
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:27,660
that crypto is one of the courses you
guys teach in your curriculum and I was

553
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:32,390
sort of wondering if there's sort of a
diverse a diversion from Lake Erie vs

554
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:36,680
practicality 99% of the people in this
room could probably tell you the number

555
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:44,009
one rule of crypto is that they don't
yes so I was wondering is there some

556
00:50:44,009 --> 00:50:48,999
sort of forum that lake we can you know
look at syllabus or something like it we

557
00:50:48,999 --> 00:50:52,959
have particular questions about what you
guys are teaching maybe a better form

558
00:50:52,959 --> 00:50:56,689
for sort of discussing and figuring out
you know how we can work together in

559
00:50:56,689 --> 00:51:05,859
this sort of stuff forums online when it
comes to mind right away is the cyber

560
00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:11,029
watch Prince George's Community
College's on the NSF they have a

561
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:16,009
repository of syllabi for college and
high school middle schoolers we can go

562
00:51:16,009 --> 00:51:20,300
and see what they're teaching lab
exercises in offer inputs and

563
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,780
ideas and that's a good starting point
you might find syllabi at various

564
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:29,070
colleges and others don't

565
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:37,870
that's a cyber watch as a starting point
for that question and answer

566
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:49,670
post-war quick

567
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:57,890
one other problem that I see is using
the term computer science I feel there

568
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:04,470
are few studies abroad and signaling
computer engineering type thing the news

569
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:09,089
science and also feel like computer
science its networking its programming

570
00:52:09,089 --> 00:52:12,589
and software design I feel like it
should be split into like in science

571
00:52:12,589 --> 00:52:17,029
there's physics and biology and
chemistry I think also that need to do

572
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:21,859
that then steps I feel like also for
research into maybe new designs for

573
00:52:21,859 --> 00:52:28,089
network security things we still do need
academia to do this research in an

574
00:52:28,089 --> 00:52:39,630
apprenticeship a good trade you wouldn't
really get that yeah computer science is

575
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:43,549
my those fields that you know how
science in the name and deals with

576
00:52:43,549 --> 00:52:52,270
science in the name usually and that's
true

577
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:57,079
graduated with a master's degree in
computer science and I noticed that

578
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:04,700
there was a trends to teach defensive
security and Waveney offensive side

579
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:14,069
associated so i was just wondering how
do we encourage academic organizations

580
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:20,950
to securely because if we don't know the
adversary we're always going to be a bit

581
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,330
behind the curve

582
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:27,720
and we're not going to find new types of
vulnerabilities and find ways to prevent

583
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:41,209
these types of things we don't know if I
don't have an answer but you know people

584
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:47,890
ages courses and since come in and we
have said we have to come up with what's

585
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:52,290
going to be in the courses reign as
professors so when things went wrong

586
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:56,520
every type person security guy I like to
steal my material from other people and

587
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,120
so you know whatever is out there on the
web

588
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,210
their labs if there are you know systems
that you should attack with you know

589
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:09,670
tutorials and all that kind of stuff at
SuperValu 4844 faculty who are trying to

590
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:14,050
create the security classes so any of
that stuff would be really useful i

591
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:19,220
think im just gonna make one for a high
point of that which is that it would be

592
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:24,450
great if we could take it as our role to
elevate the fields from one in which

593
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:30,629
basically is finding vulnerabilities in
things right which other branches of

594
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:34,960
engineering don't work that way right we
we don't have people who build bridges

595
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:42,530
that all down and then a bunch of reach
not falling down specialists

596
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:49,110
the integrated antenna fix this problem
I know how to do it

597
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:53,010
security stuff and its defensive in
nature

598
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:56,330
hopefully if you're sharp structure
professor

599
00:54:56,330 --> 00:55:02,400
because you can't teach one side of that
coin and structures have a great deal of

600
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,730
autonomy typically they can design the
courses they see fit in very well taken

601
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,920
that if there's room children can use to
make their job easier

602
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,690
they're more likely to do it the second
is to think coming in places like this

603
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:21,810
morning and seeing that the thinking in
terms of offensive and defensive back

604
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:34,080
and forth something to be exposed to get
it in 2000 into a created a fake New

605
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,710
York Times front page or new york times
were had a Mikes tell who's my boss of

606
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:43,130
the times going to jail because you're
teaching hacking and it was I'm just

607
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:46,450
playing with them but in 2009 we made
the front page of the New York Times for

608
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:50,930
cheating hacking and it was I tried it
was high fives all around so there was a

609
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:57,899
return but all of this institution you
have to explain upward what you're doing

610
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,760
that your students are learning these
things students have to be encouraged

611
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,630
inspired behave accordingly and you have
to come

612
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:11,970
ok take down the East Coast power grid
and then your students need to not take

613
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,680
down these codes power

614
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:24,279
that second part is we have time for one
more question so glad I found that in

615
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:29,350
the majority of our classes there are
rampant trivial vulnerabilities in the

616
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:35,620
examples that professors are giving in
classes I tried to fix this

617
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:39,500
professors time and time again for
pretty much all the classes and said hey

618
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,080
this example is wrong

619
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,509
fix it and they say I don't care where
I'm not paid enough to deal with this or

620
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:51,520
go away how do you practical honest
answers these how do you put pressure on

621
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:57,130
people in the most effective way to get
the stuff fixed and make sure that fixes

622
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:05,310
not just immediately thrown away by the
person who takes over if they don't have

623
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:20,110
to listen to that although there's
public shaming is ideally it's

624
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:34,500
constructive something that you could
probably help tell the story of us but

625
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:45,720
if you can collaborate with the standard
books on C programming teach you how to

626
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,040
do a buffer overflow

627
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:52,110
it's a real problem

628
00:57:52,110 --> 00:58:00,660
oK so that's it thanks for sticking
around during the blizzard which is what

629
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,609
snow flurries are golden Dec

630
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:07,230
and I think we have some closing remarks
from
