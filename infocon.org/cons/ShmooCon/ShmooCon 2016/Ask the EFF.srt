1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,830
started since it's time I have a little
bit of swagger blew out so I will do

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:13,940
that while I'm thinking out and the
party is going to be on this level

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,160
despite what the program says that it
will be two levels of people will be

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,650
gathering for a nap or eight-year
welcome to our last session of the first

5
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,619
day I think that in many ways the eff
needs no introduction

6
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:39,129
it's a delight to have them here as
always talk to all of us about what's

7
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:47,530
going on in the world so I'll just end
things over thank you very much

8
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,780
we're always pleased to be here is a
wonderful community we really enjoyed

9
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:59,690
being a part of it so some of you may
have been to ask the the eff before the

10
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,420
deal will go over it and it was first
introduced on the panel my name is Kurt

11
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:12,080
Opsahl the executive director and
general counsel with the eff work with

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,580
our coders rights project where we help
defend security researchers you might be

13
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,030
facing some difficulties for their
research or for trying to present about

14
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,850
it

15
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:31,530
when he was building 10 I'm a software
engineer at eff I worked on several

16
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,060
projects that you might know about
grandstands let's encrypts also like to

17
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:47,640
click which is a new kind of browser
test for truckers and you kind of see

18
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:55,380
how beautiful your browser is and other
projects as well

19
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,330
Eva galperin global policy analyst on
eff senior national team it's my job to

20
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:06,850
worry about the rest of the world that
is not the United States I specialize in

21
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,829
work involving extremely vulnerable
populations such as journalists and

22
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,140
activists and I hope to rate of
surveillance self-defense features our

23
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:28,200
privacy and security guy I work out a
lot of our national security cases as a

24
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,119
surveillance National Security Letters
and other things and I were gonna rights

25
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:39,810
project as well thank you so much of
this will be your questions so you get

26
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,609
to set the direction of it we're gonna
start out with a little introductions

27
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:48,930
all the things that we have been working
on over the past year and then we'll get

28
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,209
to your questions you start thinking
your questions now but i wanna lay out a

29
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:57,440
few ground rules you're one of the
things that we do the Electronic

30
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,340
Frontier Foundation is provide legal
advice to people about their their

31
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,420
situations now is not the time to ask
those questions you want to have that in

32
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,220
the tourney client privilege context not
in his words being streamed over the

33
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,810
Internet and the people in the room so I
if you have questions that are specific

34
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,970
to your legal situation or something
that should remain confidential and go

35
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,230
talk to us outside of the context of
this but this is more for your your

36
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,410
broad questions questions about what he
is doing and some of the issues of the

37
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:36,010
day I still want to just talk about a
couple of things over over the last year

38
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:42,480
CFAA the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is
very much has been on our mind many

39
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,840
years this is the federal anti hacking
statute is the primary statute that you

40
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,720
may have to worry about if you are
engaged in security research which

41
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:00,109
involves accessing computers and this
year there has been some good news and

42
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,380
bad news and some not as bad as it might
have been news

43
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,670
start off with some of the good news is
that the 2nd circuit a federal appeals

44
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:17,608
court divided into various circuits
there about fourteen of them and the 2nd

45
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:23,090
circuit has joined with the fourth in
the ninth in deciding that breaking in

46
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,830
terms of service is not enough to make
it unauthorized access not enough to

47
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,419
turn accessing something into hacking
simply goes it was in violation of the

48
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:33,469
Terms of Service

49
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,320
they had that a good quote that I think
somewhere as a lot of our concerns with

50
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,300
the direction the Department justice has
been going with this court noted that

51
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,850
while the government might promise not
to prosecute checking Facebook at work

52
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,800
we are not at liberty to take the
government and its word and this is a

53
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,120
problem they the government wants to
answer this with prosecutorial

54
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,410
discretion will be cool don't worry
about it will only go after the bad guys

55
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,200
but the law is the law and if we want to
make sure that they're not doing it we

56
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,349
need to interpret the law correctly and
not expand hacking statute into a

57
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,689
generalized way

58
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:18,069
of using criminal enforcement for a
violation of promise now the band there

59
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:23,429
continue to be overzealous prosecution
has brought them or in most cases it's

60
00:05:23,429 --> 00:05:27,909
the local United States Attorney for
that jurisdiction who brings a

61
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:33,969
prosecution using the very broad powers
of the CFA and the harsh penalties in

62
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:39,839
particular this this year has been
following the case of Matthew key is he

63
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:47,329
was charged with violating the CFA for
defacing the website something then in

64
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:52,679
the physical world might have been
trespass charge of vandalism charge but

65
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:58,888
at a much lower penalty level maybe 30
or 90 days but under the CFAA is facing

66
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,479
up to twenty-five years he will not get
anything close to the high end of that

67
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,089
but there's still a lot to look down and
actually the sentencing is going to be a

68
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:10,589
hundred twenty or so in a couple of days
and we'll find out what happens there

69
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:15,309
the problem does continue and in the
other not as bad as it might have been

70
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:22,379
there were some terrible amendments
proposed to the CFA hu to make it more

71
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:27,819
hardcore basically to remove misdemeanor
from it so virtually everything we

72
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:32,569
violation would also be a felony
increasing some of the penalties we

73
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:37,289
thought this was a very much in the
wrong direction this was put forward by

74
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:42,239
senator Sheldon Whitehouse which by the
way is sometimes a little bit confusing

75
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:45,628
to have a senator whose name white house
and you think about the white house but

76
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:50,050
this was a senator who brought it
forward when the amendment failed he he

77
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:56,259
blamed it on the secret probe botnet
caucus I think that in fact it was more

78
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:00,309
civil liberties minded individuals who
sought where things were going to talk

79
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:01,240
to their representatives

80
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,030
and put a stop to this and then what's
on tap

81
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,530
coming up soon we recently argued before
the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal on the

82
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,429
question of whether having low income vs
bypassing IP address blocks of somebody

83
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,310
puts a particular IP address on the
block list and then you go actions the

84
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,710
site by you know the cafe down the
street is that hacking is that the kind

85
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:31,169
of a federal felony we think it
shouldn't be in argued as much to lead

86
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:35,770
to the court and we're awaiting their
decision and then moving a little bit

87
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,770
outside of the CFAA but something that I
think is of interest to this audience

88
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:47,750
they DMC Digital Millennium Copyright
Act has been prohibitions against trying

89
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:55,650
to bypass controls DRAM they would
control access to the copyrights and we

90
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:01,380
we asked for and the Library of Congress
granted an exemption for security

91
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:08,130
researchers focused on carjacking and
there was a lot of carjacking in the

92
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,919
news that helped set the stage for this
in addition to finding out that

93
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:18,180
Volkswagen was doing its own internal
hacking to shut off the ignition system

94
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:24,909
that that helped the argument that
independent researchers should be able

95
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:28,560
to double check what the car mattress
manufacturers are saying they're doing

96
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,789
their couple other exemptions going i
think one of them was also of interest

97
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,360
was

98
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,700
you can jailbreak your phone you might
as well we know we've been able to

99
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,409
jailbreak iPhone four years well the
funny thing about the DMCA is you have

100
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,529
to ask for the exemption every three
years and if you don't ask for it again

101
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:51,930
it goes away so even if it's fairly
obvious this is the right choice and

102
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,699
they've made their choice in the past
you still gotta go through the process

103
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,600
every three years so we're hoping for
some DMCA reforms so that doesn't get

104
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,899
caught in that cycle but in the meantime
we're going there and we're getting the

105
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:21,829
exemptions so that's a little bit of
work on turnover rate for those of you

106
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,660
who haven't

107
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:30,939
automated free transparent standards
compliance certificate authority that we

108
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:36,930
launched in kind of injunction with
automatic and a number of other partners

109
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:44,800
and just last month and so far we've
already had three hundred and fifteen

110
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,660
thousand serbs issued and if things keep
going the way that they are going we

111
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,019
will have doubled the number of the
amount of inclusion on the Web one year

112
00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:06,640
from now this is a great start I mean we
really want is for the weather to be

113
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,949
incurred by default we don't want to be
some kind of outlier that you know you

114
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:17,370
session on the web

115
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,699
you want any information to you that
you're transferring over the wires being

116
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:25,740
courted not only because you want

117
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,610
you know that information to be private
but also because of censorship you know

118
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:37,530
teams for instance where you're not able
to access the weather's really you are

119
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:48,250
perhaps here you can basically they can
selectively blocks are in route that you

120
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:53,880
actually can't access the web really can
actually see all that you want to see

121
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:02,840
one of the things that we did is we
really making this idea of complaints

122
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,220
you want to meet this and open source
and free project we formed this thing

123
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,520
called the automatic certificate
management environment which is like me

124
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:20,620
that's the standard that Canada's dance
that is done in order to prove that you

125
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:28,680
control the demand resource that you're
so I encourage everyone to get a look at

126
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:36,040
that standard see what you can do with
that and also is there anyone in the

127
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:49,410
room that works for the industry has to
restructure because it's a project that

128
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:56,530
isn't just for Oster on but it's for the
world to run being an open standard so

129
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:05,209
so that means we actually are ported up
with I didn't trust which is already

130
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:11,399
known and trusted by browsers we have
our own let's encourage intermediate

131
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:21,199
surge that's cross jurors so that if you
install into your own website it already

132
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:30,649
browsers and not only did you know
there's this kind of ever evolving I

133
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:35,119
guess realm of security when it comes to
security we have you know things like

134
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:39,920
car seat for things like shot one source
that are deprecated we really want

135
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:47,649
people to be using the latest and
greatest thinkers available one of the

136
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:54,499
things that makes possible is for you to
once you install its encrypt and

137
00:12:54,499 --> 00:13:01,619
actually and as this hands-on approach
if you wanna do for your web server so

138
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:06,829
you manage your reserves throughout
saying corruption and letting actually

139
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:13,449
whenever you run and get updates ideally
it will basically go

140
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:20,450
and make sure that if the next you know
it happens you're going to you the best

141
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:32,560
savers and you're gonna have you know
that the latest there so there's there's

142
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,339
this last year we were working on
analyzing this name is planned by

143
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:45,830
t-mobile I don't know if y'all have seen
the video of John Laker

144
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:57,780
asking who the fuck is he who pays you
you guys do so basically t-mobile last

145
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:05,600
year announce this binge on land and in
john is not necessarily a bad idea at

146
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,090
the outset if you look at it it's this
wage you physically browse streaming

147
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:22,520
video zero-rated in a way that you won't
actually with and for instance if you

148
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:35,560
are and have a Netflix users you know
great benefit for you you know just the

149
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,770
way it works is that a website will
actually popped into wanting to actually

150
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:46,870
being part of this man John plan and
that'll mean any data transferred from

151
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:55,660
that website will not be counted towards
your your data as an end user

152
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:01,640
the way that is worse is that all videos
were transported downtown for ATP

153
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:09,670
and so you know it's much less the
problem with this is a colleague of mine

154
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:16,729
actually looked at this and certain
analyzing how this is all working he saw

155
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,310
that it wasn't just the websites that
were offering in but it was every single

156
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:28,130
website was getting this was analyzing
looking for video streams and

157
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,700
transporting down not only that but it
wasn't just videos that were directly

158
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:39,120
streaming off of you know directly
streaming from your device it was also

159
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:51,430
downloaded for later use it was
basically biasing based on content type

160
00:15:51,430 --> 00:16:12,329
on it and we're down to our best benefit
because internet came out and had this

161
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:22,840
tag we are yet we kind of gave us a lot
of pride to you too you know how much we

162
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:30,860
have out there and how much people are
willing to have our about things so

163
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:38,370
those are more recent developments we
launched privacy badger last year

164
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:46,040
if you don't have that installed on that
kind of is a way to block intrusive

165
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:54,900
crackers and a joggers in your browser
and it takes this approach looks at what

166
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:01,640
looked like a tracker and it looks like
a tracker tracker that would be pretty

167
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:08,220
sure the tracker and and so we lock
based on that so i dont wanna take up

168
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:14,490
too much time but kind of projects that
we've been working on that project site

169
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:23,400
of so I'm going to talk really quick
about three projects that I'm involved

170
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:31,480
in that directly involved and worries
you wouldn't think the international

171
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,690
team really has a lot to do with
security research but most securities

172
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,870
research is in fact international
involves people working together across

173
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,520
borders the security research
communities worldwide and so this is

174
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,900
actually something that takes up a lot
of my time we can start with one of the

175
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,130
most worrying bills coming down the line

176
00:17:53,130 --> 00:18:00,590
the UK has spent the last year to
becoming even more terrifying

177
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:05,270
surveillance state than it has been in
the past and one of the things that

178
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:09,970
they're doing right now is considering a
bill called the investigatory powers

179
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:16,460
bill that is supposed to sort of
formalized what law enforcement and

180
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:22,559
surveillance can do in the UK in the
interest of gathering intelligence and

181
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,149
and a quote

182
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:30,970
investigating serious crimes now the
bill is about three hundred pages long

183
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:38,909
designed to destroy her soul if you
attempt to read it but it is mostly made

184
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:48,960
of rubles within the number of trucks is
language which makes it possible for the

185
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,960
government to conduct mass surveillance
in many different ways different parts

186
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,570
of this bill get modified there are
still Lupul's you can drive mass

187
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:03,270
surveillance and one of those loopholes
especially worried about is called

188
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:08,908
interference where the whole idea is
that the government can basically like

189
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:14,320
how can I S and then look at all the
data going through the ISP as long as

190
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,158
there might be intelligence in there or
evidence of a serious crime so you can

191
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,289
see this really gives british
intelligence gathering in law

192
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:31,429
enforcement an unprecedented level of
power with almost no oversight and

193
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:38,090
nearly zero accountability so one of the
things that you have done about this is

194
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,459
we have submitted comments submitted no
less than four sets of comments

195
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,450
the British Parliament talking about
specific parts of the bill and why they

196
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:57,130
worry us in addition to bulk collection
and computer interference there is also

197
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:02,760
a section of the bill that specifically
scenes to target security research there

198
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,320
is there is a section that basically
says if you are working on producing or

199
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:15,399
running some sort of surveillance
software that they essentially reserve

200
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,240
the right who hacked eugenic to see what
you're doing so

201
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,120
security researchers be extremely
worried about this just in case the

202
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:35,810
security researchers in the room here
are not already paranoid enough

203
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:42,790
we're so the good news is that we've
done a lot to encrypt the web so there

204
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:48,430
are a lot more websites running as the
cell there are more and more people

205
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,320
using encrypted communications including
end-to-end encrypted rules like signal

206
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,490
yeah I think this is great but
governments have noticed that the

207
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:05,460
increasingly in the increasingly
encrypted web is causing them to what

208
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:11,710
the FBI calls go dark so it's no longer
trivially easy for them to spy on all of

209
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,080
your traffic so if they're particularly
interested in you

210
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,409
one of the things that they can do is
they can compromise your endpoint and

211
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:23,030
usually the way that they do this is
through malware so I have spent the last

212
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:27,990
several years gathering up state
sponsored malware used by various deeds

213
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,720
against against government are not
against governments because when

214
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,680
government spy on other governments this
is mostly not my problem I care about

215
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,330
when government spy on ordinary
individuals on activists on journalists

216
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,550
on the kind of people who can be
expected to know to protect themselves

217
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:50,149
and how the set of skills were those
sort of power differential is

218
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:55,870
exceptionally high and where the
government has the power to imprison

219
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:01,800
dissidents or send them torture torture
center in Syria just shoot them in the

220
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,790
head outside the kremlin so these are
the sorts of things but I worry about

221
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,750
the stakes are very high

222
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,770
one of the things that I've been doing
is

223
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:16,020
gathering of malware that was used by
the Assad regime to spy on opposition

224
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:22,840
figures in Syria where there was used by
the Vietnamese government whose by on

225
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,590
journalists and people who work for NGOs
including me by the way which I thought

226
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:34,090
was particularly hilarious about a year
and a half ago I was targeted by the

227
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:40,770
Vietnamese government malware and so I
turned right around and it really save

228
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:45,060
me a lot of research time when they send
it to me directly but what was

229
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,980
especially you what was especially
worrying was also targeted one of my

230
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,560
coworkers is only involvement in Vietnam
was writing a single blog about a

231
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,320
democracy activist in vietnam had been
imprisoned because I haven't had time to

232
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,919
rate so what we're seeing is that the
the number of things you have to do in

233
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,840
this sort of the extent to which you
need to stand up to a government in

234
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,490
order to earn it the tension is not very
high and snow returning to the to the

235
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:21,240
theme of my work you should probably be
paranoid and finally let's let's talk

236
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,420
about what I think is actually the
greatest

237
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:31,430
sort of the biggest threat to security
research right now and that is the

238
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:38,970
Rossoneri arrangements how many of you
are familiar with US export controls can

239
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,730
save yourself some trouble

240
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:55,480
around so it is a is an agreement
between 41 countries all over the world

241
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:03,160
and it mostly governs the export of arms
so things like grenades and landmines

242
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:10,760
and guns in 2013 in response to the kind
of malware research that I do showing

243
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:17,600
that targeted malware is being used to
facilitate human rights abusers some

244
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,879
European lawmakers made some changes to
Boston or and expanded to include

245
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,820
certain types of surveillance technology
so the good news is that we we raised

246
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,760
awareness about the important issue and
the bad news is that the way that those

247
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:44,090
of us in our language was written was
extremely vague and basically you would

248
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:51,419
if implemented even as written would
result in a lot of handcuffs on the kind

249
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:57,080
of work that security researchers do
every day because targeting offensive

250
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,590
defensive capabilities it's actually
really hard because people work in

251
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,379
security research know that there's
really not that much difference between

252
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:11,260
offense and defense to make things worse
each country has to implement the

253
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:18,220
changes on their own so last year this

254
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:26,650
Department of Commerce Road proposed
implementation of the vast and not only

255
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:31,929
did include the most worrisome
interpretation of the vast in our

256
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:38,490
language but it also included an extra
little bit like a cherry on top in which

257
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:44,450
they proposed who to regulate the sale
of software involved in the development

258
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:52,970
of the eroding exploits nothing could go
wrong so the bills and state department

259
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,990
the Department of Commerce all issued a
call for comments and the entire

260
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:02,600
security industry got together instead
this is not going to work out so right

261
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,260
now this is back to the drawing board
they are proposing a new implementation

262
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:13,200
and well they will not promise they will
go back to Boston or this year and

263
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,210
negotiate for a rollback of the original
Dawson our language that is one of the

264
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,990
things that is on the table so one of
the things that all of you security

265
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:30,559
researchers can do is to contact you or
your senator or congressman especially

266
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,350
if they have an important committees and
let them know that this is a this is an

267
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:41,580
issue that you're very worried about and
they should put pressure on business and

268
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,600
commerce and the state department in
order to stop this from moving forward

269
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,539
and also that they should all go to
Boston are and try to get this language

270
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:54,300
changed

271
00:26:54,300 --> 00:27:09,740
and get your questions on things that I
work on vacation and so rather than

272
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:17,360
going with categories of the good stuff
I thought I would do things that

273
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,459
shouldn't happen only once every four
years and things that seem like they're

274
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:29,950
going to take forty years so on the
things that shouldn't happen with the

275
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:38,220
biggest thing first

276
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:44,960
activities since the seventies and the
building a lot of time working on we had

277
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,480
our sort of are positives and negatives
and ultimately it in governor

278
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,990
nevertheless it did a couple of very
important things ended the NSA's master

279
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:17,940
has called attention to buy as of
November of this year and that had I

280
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,880
just wanna know that it's you a couple
of other very important things in a

281
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:32,400
transparent process there's now a Makita
can be brought in when they hear from

282
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:41,990
you know some

283
00:28:41,990 --> 00:29:03,800
records for all these years into the
past

284
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:29,780
took an emergency motion to get them to
show you things but by ending the top

285
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:38,950
cascading

286
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:45,130
2006 so this is the category of things
that seem like they're gonna take forty

287
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:51,370
years we've been very long time and it's
hard to put us super positive spin on

288
00:29:51,370 --> 00:30:00,070
how far we've come in that case you'll
vs we've been up to the appeals court

289
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:06,230
twice already were just there in
December and we've now and we're not

290
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:23,620
beginning but we're really hoping that
access is about right on the law that we

291
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:29,010
really just can't get to do that because
the standings degrees

292
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:50,410
you know it's frustrating I think
there's no there's no snow no records

293
00:30:50,410 --> 00:31:14,950
cases we have two organizations
different sides writes really exercise

294
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:20,670
your first another theory that we really
well now that the telephone records

295
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,500
program has ended we still have claims
that's arrived and we like courts to

296
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,400
weigh in on whether rate but again

297
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:36,390
30 hurdles and the court has been
extremely weird dude you're from the

298
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,440
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
exactly what the government thinks

299
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,620
should be done with the records they've
seized which go to our standing and go

300
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:53,840
to proving surveil and so that's been
fully briefed in more than a year and a

301
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:01,590
half so it's it's it's frustrating and
then just a word on when USA freedom

302
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:06,000
didn't do it doesn't touch the NCAA's
activities under Section seven or two of

303
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,150
the accidents with a used to have an
ironic backgrounds with the prison

304
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:16,690
peremptory get things directly from the
providers Google and that's a massive

305
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,760
amount of surveillance and really enjoy
brazil has a case should touch that the

306
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:29,320
disturbance moving initial you has a
case down standing and even seem though

307
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,159
you may have seen Wall Street Journal
there was some spying on Iran Israel

308
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,360
Dakota members of Congress and then all
of a sudden members of congress seem to

309
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,850
care about a so-called incidental
surveillance where there are not the

310
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:47,810
target of it but there are swept up in
one and foreign nations to and so you

311
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:52,450
know there's some maybe some light near
the engine in the last thing is an

312
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:58,060
executive order multiple streets is a a
reagan era or that allows spying outside

313
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:02,200
the United States and and there's lots
more semester is going on

314
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:10,310
also speaks of Americans and this really
has been touched by cameras and is

315
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:15,129
really at this point under the control
the congress could certainly step in and

316
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:19,780
regulate but also President Obama in
line with things he's running for

317
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:24,760
president and and and afterward could
rein it in himself by an executive he's

318
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,100
been doing a lot of executive orders
relating to look at this and saying

319
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:36,959
isn't gonna focus on you know impact
litigation slow and was originally

320
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:47,020
years are involved in a group of bosnia
mentioned going dark rhetoric this has

321
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:51,460
been a year to where we see a lot of
saber-rattling by the intelligence

322
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,800
community out now which is causing their
investigation CEO dark they don't have

323
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,110
access to information they need to act
on terrorism prosecute drug dealers or

324
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,990
whatever

325
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,550
FBI director James Comey has been on the
forefront of this and saying some stuff

326
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:13,070
this audience obviously knows is is
inaccurate

327
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,270
idea that there can be a backdoor
communications or a golden key or

328
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:22,170
whatever you wanna call it a response
from you and from the tech companies and

329
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:27,540
from people has been we don't we don't
think that's a good idea it's not worth

330
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,300
the risks

331
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,370
one of the one who is it is really try
to harness that support is with another

332
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:39,770
group called access now we organize save
crypto door which was a petition the

333
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:44,870
White House we did people say and we got
more than 200,000 signatures which will

334
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,100
you need to get the way to respond

335
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,600
their responses a little mystifying it
was it was sort of a non-response

336
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,810
response but it leads to us meeting with
them and injuring telling them what we

337
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,390
thought their their position on
corruption should be right now their

338
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:07,839
position is we don't support any
legislation that would bar now we have a

339
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,550
year left in office for this
administration that's not good enough so

340
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:16,990
some of our demands are this is Damon
the company president he should say I

341
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:22,569
don't support legislation that would in
any way you clarify what he means when

342
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:27,860
he says i supports he said i'ma strong
believer in strong encryption which is

343
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,120
to this audience doesn't mean a whole
lot and so should clarify that means he

344
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:38,450
supports and encryption encryption
smartphones and other devices that user

345
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:44,500
and then you should say that he doesn't
support any executive action by any

346
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,400
member of the branch that's inconsistent
were very worried about is that people

347
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,890
like you who you know run services they
use encryption gonna get friendly calls

348
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,790
from the government that say it's your
patriotic duty did do some sort of

349
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:03,350
backdoor into this why don't you do it
people are going to die and so we you

350
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:09,930
know we really hope that the government
won't do that well publicly saying

351
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:14,839
so that's that's what we're hoping to be
seen from the white house meanwhile

352
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,259
members of congress are threatening to
do and we wouldn't be surprised if

353
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:29,349
legislation feinstein essential
something as well and we will be

354
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:38,140
watching very very much for all although
we can you may have seen as a New York

355
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,890
state senator introduced a bill to
require all smartphones sold in New York

356
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:47,210
to be decrypted well you know that's
terrible idea and I i think is a matter

357
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:53,260
of states can even constitutional I
would be surprised if anywhere but its

358
00:36:53,260 --> 00:37:00,190
guns and press recently that I think we
can open it up for questions thank you

359
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:07,210
so we have a microphone here in the in
the centers of a lineup that Mike and

360
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:12,960
then we will you take your questions one
of the time we got about a little over

361
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:22,390
20 minutes before five o'clock so glad
to hear your questions so gets a lot of

362
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:29,710
praise and less maybe its major telecoms
I was wondering if personally each one

363
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:38,810
of you what you thought maybe in the
past year has done wrong

364
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:44,250
alright classic interview tough
questions your greatest false

365
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:54,680
like we're too much of a perfectionist I
I think something would have wanted to

366
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:04,549
to see we we tried to stop him from
sharing bill wasn't wasn't a

367
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:16,020
particularly good good bill tabled for
surveillance and immunity to tell them

368
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:20,330
to give them a check

369
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:27,259
away from them to try to not make
mistakes there means from the attempted

370
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,240
to do that we've successfully in the
past

371
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,779
pushed back against some other forms of
information sharing bills but this time

372
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:52,880
it didn't go through as part of the
omnibus bill and we weren't able to the

373
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:00,510
vision of season expand on a little
worried about anything that we can do to

374
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:06,130
defend ourselves out of the question so
this is the information sharing bill it

375
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:11,320
actually I think it has to do is like
the cybersecurity act of 2015 Bellino it

376
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:18,370
is season or under its original name and
I think they're the greatest challenges

377
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:26,430
I was just alluding to is it provides
for ways in which companies can share

378
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:31,578
birthrate indicators but these are some
broadly defines and vague definitions

379
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:38,319
that would allow it to go beyond and has
liability limitations so that the the

380
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:43,880
companies who might be sharing this
information can get it wrong there

381
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:50,339
really wasn't a serious threat if a bad
actor who is engaged in in malicious

382
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:55,069
behavior and share their information
they weren't really gonna show you for

383
00:39:55,069 --> 00:40:00,099
this because they're trying to hide
their tracks in their living overseas in

384
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:06,670
behind seven proxies they concern they
were worried about is what if they put

385
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:13,109
in innocent person's information is an
innocent person might be offended if the

386
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:18,140
government there are some consequences
to them and so the liability limitations

387
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:24,618
or to make it to the company don't have
to worry so much of the nation and that

388
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:31,559
that takes away a check on the other the
other big challenges I have with with

389
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:36,089
tremendous energy you know coming up
with his bill writing it debating and so

390
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:41,250
on and it really isn't getting to a lot
of the core problems that are affecting

391
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,859
our our security you know it's not going
to do anything to make people update

392
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:50,859
their software more frequently and make
sure they have the latest patches in two

393
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:55,990
mins vendors who be very responsive to
vulnerability reports and get patches

394
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:00,009
out as quickly as possible it's not
going to do anything about the trouble

395
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:05,780
with things that have firmware that will
has gone bad and there's no easy way to

396
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,790
get it up there is a lot of serious
problems we have with our computer and

397
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:18,349
network security and sharing around the
signature of a malware file is useful

398
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:22,290
but that was already being done there
already were thread indicator databases

399
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:25,950
people would submit things to that a lot
of the things that that are part of his

400
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:30,558
bill were happening in the most valuable
thing for information sharing is the

401
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:31,330
government

402
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:37,580
start being a little leftover and
realize the value actually sharing some

403
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:45,080
of the receives with targets with
vulnerable systems inside and they'll be

404
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,610
able to do that they can just start
doing it under an executive or so I

405
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:53,760
guess that's one of the greater
tragedies they're putting so much time

406
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,980
and effort into something that isn't
gonna be very useful and has the

407
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:11,410
potential for enabling more surveillance
on the legislative judicial branches and

408
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:16,779
organizing your power and light getting
what you want done through those crashes

409
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:26,460
and I feel like those branches of the
executive order safe on top of that

410
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:36,300
people high range those areas like the
FBI director are not educated so my

411
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:47,560
question is do you like representatives
people that I'm sorry education of DoD

412
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:57,130
and actually like to push back on some
of this I don't think that the director

413
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:01,610
economy is an idiot I don't think he
doesn't know how the internet works and

414
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:06,040
I think it's really hard to get anything
done in washington D C if you assume

415
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,070
that the problem is that your enemies
are stupid

416
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:13,110
our problem is not their enemies are
stupid or bar problem is their enemies

417
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:17,260
are very smart and they know how to get
their way and this is how you get the

418
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:22,590
sort of going dark rhetoric I think o me
understand but the FBI is not in fact

419
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:28,069
going dark and in fact that the NC's
collect everything

420
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:34,569
just throw everything in the haystack
method was not useful in fact former NSA

421
00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:38,979
directors have come out and said that
this this particular way of going about

422
00:43:38,979 --> 00:43:46,999
things doesn't work so I'm not really
sure that education is is what they need

423
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:51,618
there are people in government who don't
understand how the internet works and

424
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:57,289
frequently those are you know governors
and senators and congressmen especially

425
00:43:57,289 --> 00:44:02,989
the heads of committees which I find
very worrying and judges and to that end

426
00:44:02,989 --> 00:44:10,579
we actually do a lot of Education we
have been brought in to debrief people

427
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:15,170
in government fairly often but I don't
think that specifically the DOJ for the

428
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:20,680
DoD or the FBI is lacking in that kind
of expertise

429
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,969
they're just using rhetoric that makes
you think that maybe they don't know how

430
00:44:23,969 --> 00:44:27,549
the internet works because it's going to
get them what they want

431
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:37,319
really nefarious about going dark kind
of rhetoric is that it's actually also

432
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:44,058
just completely not true in terms of
their ability to specific targets they

433
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:51,869
can certainly the boy things as we know
they've done through targeted 0 days and

434
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:59,150
that's kind of something that we we've
seen through documents there there I

435
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:07,410
could use program actually haven't
really shared these days and and haven't

436
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:13,420
actually helped to the security overall
of companies that

437
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:24,170
history and this these deities target so
that's what you mind and just that that

438
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,960
sat outside

439
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,809
nevertheless we also have been involved
in in talking to people in in government

440
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:36,490
in trying to provide technical
assistance and conversations where

441
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:41,089
people are actually some very smart
people at the White House's Office of

442
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:46,160
Science and Technology Policy know what
they're talking about

443
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:53,700
it's a very big thing there are
certainly other people who might know it

444
00:45:53,700 --> 00:46:12,379
is a different approach people who are
interested in security and privacy

445
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:28,589
writing bills that are actually what
they want and what we have campaigns on

446
00:46:28,589 --> 00:46:36,680
active and these campaigns actually
target congress and I think that's one

447
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,740
thing that's extremely valuable is
congress do you know when you actually

448
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:46,959
impose your mail to do you let them know
that you're actually a software

449
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,269
developer you know has technology works
you know what's at stake

450
00:46:51,269 --> 00:47:00,689
and how how how this all together and
having that extra emphasis on the fact

451
00:47:00,689 --> 00:47:08,439
that you're a good person that knows in
this field into italy is valuable for

452
00:47:08,439 --> 00:47:15,749
members of congress today to have no we
we do a lot of mailings that congress of

453
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:24,519
them are we have taxed but we also
encourage people to add yes there's the

454
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:31,598
context there there specific notes too
because they actually is valued more

455
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:37,909
than than you know said the default text
for instance you know other thing is

456
00:47:37,909 --> 00:47:44,729
that you can help out with if you go to
argue how you can go to you you have dot

457
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:51,598
com slash work and that all projects and
in addition to you

458
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,289
contributing to the software also just
opening issues let us know about what

459
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:59,979
are somewhere else because our software
isn't hundred-percent it as failure

460
00:47:59,979 --> 00:48:03,519
cases and we don't necessarily know
about them and then people cocktail

461
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:10,649
table like this and like you know
there's a bug in your software is this

462
00:48:10,649 --> 00:48:17,759
thing like oh great well you know
actually over this issue in a practical

463
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:21,550
way so that's definitely something that
we really

464
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:31,810
game that feedback from users is also
have a couple of things for people in

465
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:38,520
the security industry can do one of them
is for the people who work in thread

466
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:44,030
intel and the people who work with users
who are in extremely vulnerable

467
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:48,370
populations when you're making your
products think about those vulnerable

468
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:53,400
people think about a user in Syria or a
journalist in Turkey and when you're

469
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,830
coming up with your threat model you
should include usually include them and

470
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:00,840
you should definitely think about how
you're going to keep those people safe

471
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,730
because there's really a lot at stake
for them when they use your products one

472
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:09,480
of the things that I hear most often
from security professionals when I come

473
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:14,530
and I asked them about you know
journalists in some obscure

474
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:19,360
authoritarian state is oh yeah we've
seen plenty of malware come from

475
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,210
come from XDA just nobody cares because
it's not particularly sophisticated and

476
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,290
there are not a lot of users so start
thinking about those people and when you

477
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:32,009
see that kind of malware coming down the
pipe give me a call you can email me at

478
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:38,290
work very interested in this stuff even
if traditionally the security industry

479
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:43,050
is not the other thing I wanted to talk
about real quick are comments as I

480
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:50,110
mentioned before eff has filed comments
in requests in response to an open call

481
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:55,910
for comments from civil society in
academia in the security industry on the

482
00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:00,899
investigatory powers bill we also filed
comments in response to a request for

483
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:09,300
comment from about about their proposed
implementation of us when we did there

484
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:14,150
were also dozens and dozens of comments
from individual security researchers

485
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,090
academics

486
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:22,450
and also independent security company is
talking about how this legislation was

487
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:26,830
going to affect them and their business
and the stuff of really makes a very big

488
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:32,710
difference in the stuff that every one
of you can write one thing I forgot to

489
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:37,310
mention is that you're also here in BC I
mean you have a right to the year of

490
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:40,970
your member of Congress and their
staffers you can call them and actually

491
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:47,560
make a meeting organized a meeting with
them and they're here it's important to

492
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,970
realize that they're here to serve you
and don't forget about the state and

493
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:56,319
local level you know this is a
particularly surveillance side of things

494
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:02,420
the technologies that we see filter down
to a local law enforcement is being one

495
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:07,300
of the funding comes from the federal
level and then the same by the man

496
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:15,920
you're using them often very secure way
we're used to being done by activists

497
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,620
locally getting access to contracts and
purchasing orders and just finding out

498
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:24,500
what technology there there's a local
law enforcement are using you know were

499
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:30,030
based in California we've legislation
and other stuff for a long time and

500
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:35,280
we're doing outside California but still
you affiliates are doing that as well

501
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,540
and then and there's nothing stopping
you from public records act request to

502
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:44,960
get get access that kind of mission and
being somebody who can interpret what

503
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:51,710
model is capable of is actually very
useful

504
00:51:51,710 --> 00:52:04,680
the status quo when personal information
of identity theft protection and problem

505
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,799
solved

506
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:13,150
and it seems likely that folks are gonna
realize that there is a specific costs

507
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:18,230
and they're gonna start weighing the
costs against operating systems and I

508
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:29,410
was wondering about $109 and remaining
after a number of users ten million

509
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:35,470
dollars and you know what operating
systems and just wear their risk against

510
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:39,459
the cost and I was wondering if this is
something is on your radar from your

511
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:44,839
concern with its legitimate and if there
is any recourse for

512
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:50,880
I guess if you think there's a
legitimate negligence going on in terms

513
00:52:50,880 --> 00:53:01,470
of primarily where we have worked in
that area is looking at data breach

514
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:08,270
notification issues that at least
they're getting if people are informed

515
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:15,630
that there has been a data breach that
actions to themselves it's it's not

516
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:21,450
clear to me that you know years worth of
identity theft protection is that strong

517
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:25,700
protection as your employer and they're
a determined

518
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:35,060
adversary but useful in some
circumstances but the first thing we've

519
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:41,720
been focusing on is noted and we have
right now is it's a mix of various state

520
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:50,330
laws that have different standards there
have been attempts you have notification

521
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:56,009
by the federal level and this there
might be some advantages to that so long

522
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:02,430
as they are good standard the advantage
is that it's a lot easier for everyone

523
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:10,169
to be on the same stamp on the company's
know what's doing the Edina breach games

524
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:18,300
about where the data is located at the
danger of course is a thing that goes

525
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,650
through the legislative process has a
possibility of being watered down and

526
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:30,910
ultimately not what you had hoped for in
the end the ultimate thing that has been

527
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:35,269
happening we haven't gotten very
directly involved in

528
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:43,578
talking about aids private lawsuits that
are people who have had a bridge to

529
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:49,029
class action system and you know that
that can sometimes be good it's a good

530
00:54:49,029 --> 00:55:00,999
way what incentive to be good but also
on on times action doesn't end up doing

531
00:55:00,999 --> 00:55:07,738
very much to help the class and does a
lot to help the attorneys who might not

532
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:11,409
be the most efficient use of resources
all the time

533
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:15,859
there are there are good point of class
action attorneys who are trying to help

534
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:28,409
the class and there are some depend on
corporate standpoint and from the user

535
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:33,929
side a few years ago I heard a piano
talking about whether as growing money

536
00:55:33,929 --> 00:55:41,139
the civil and possible criminal
penalties after a breach was a

537
00:55:41,139 --> 00:55:46,669
legitimate alternative as a cyber
security mechanism and this is the first

538
00:55:46,669 --> 00:55:50,299
year that in my day job I've actually
heard company talking about that when

539
00:55:50,299 --> 00:55:54,399
talking about the budget for security
are you seeing any of that and you think

540
00:55:54,399 --> 00:56:02,638
it's a defensible legal strategy to make
sure that this is the notion of like

541
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:07,399
rather than put in the money on security
to prevent a breach will put some money

542
00:56:07,399 --> 00:56:20,769
aside to pay for 11 happens and I hadn't
heard of that in the in this essentially

543
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:26,609
insurance and you know I have heard of
some things that were similar in other

544
00:56:26,609 --> 00:56:31,360
contexts that turned out to be someone
badly like when car manufacturers

545
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,730
found out that there were problems with
their cars like they could flip over and

546
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:38,980
explode and they determined it was
cheaper to put some money aside to pay

547
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:44,620
the lawsuits when they make them so they
didn't this worked out badly when they

548
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:50,660
got caught and as it turned out

549
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:57,710
that was turned out to be a very bad
factories in the lawsuits over car

550
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:03,470
exploded killing the occupants has
hopefully we're not talking about the

551
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:07,470
kinds of security breaches that would
lead to that that activity will be

552
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:15,790
someone was harmed but I think it is
better for society if we had in having

553
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:22,279
good security are ultimately still have
a brief despite the best efforts but do

554
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,900
the best efforts try and make sure that
you're you're in the top of the game and

555
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:31,180
says someone has to try really hard
maybe they have to burn a note something

556
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:36,529
extra special to get out the information
is worth the investment and that came up

557
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:39,940
in the panel doors and the
counter-argument is corporations are not

558
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,250
answerable to society there answerable
to their shareholders and if it's less

559
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:47,740
expensive to do this inference oscuro
maybe in the benefit of the corporation

560
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:54,029
thank you thank everybody for for your
questions we've we've come to the end of

561
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:58,650
our time we have to pretty quickly
because they're they're setting up for

562
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,150
the night

563
