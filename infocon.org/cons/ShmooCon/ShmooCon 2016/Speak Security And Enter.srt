1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
check out all of the events that are
down the hallway when she make a pass

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,599
the the vendors we are having the party
tonight at nine o'clock all the details

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:18,109
are in your program NOW on page 14 check
the twitters later for exact info

4
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:36,489
beyond that I do have some giveaways
anyone need a water bottle so who in the

5
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:45,099
front row once and post it

6
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:57,539
thank you all for being here on time we
will get going

7
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,510
your speaker is just a year when she is
from the one Password folks in its gonna

8
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:16,570
tell you all about security enjoy hi
everyone I'm sorry I had to fix this

9
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,148
thing thanks for coming in a little bit
nervous so I'm just warning you I might

10
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:24,560
get trigger happy with this and I might
hack back if one comes flying at me

11
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,509
sorry I'm not sorry that being said the
title of my session is weak security and

12
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:37,000
enter better ways to communicate
security to non-technical users if you

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,590
do know me i think im and say hi after
this is done if you don't you might know

14
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,920
my necklace I'm not sure how clear it is
but it says ops hack this necklace gets

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,000
me in trouble all the time it's actually
about OPSEC I would recommend not

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,250
getting one of your own people will
recognize you everywhere

17
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,479
one Password one password is my boo I
will tell all of you

18
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,460
ten times to going get a password
manager and use one it's a really great

19
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,990
tool to help take care of your shit
online and that's the end of that for

20
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:11,358
now I do quite a bit of work in raising
awareness of security and privacy issues

21
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:16,390
and education I have a hashtag I like to
use to you on Twitter I'm in quite a few

22
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,608
people in this room help contribute to
that conversation so thanks a lot

23
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:27,180
should probably give you a warning about
the stock it's not a technical talk I'm

24
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,850
not going to be dropping like any leet
hax there's not going to be any Lake

25
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,239
amazing 0 days it's really gonna be more
about people-centric approaches to

26
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,019
technology and security and quite a bit
of it is going to be based on my own

27
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:45,319
experiences of turning pretty much every
conversation i've had for the past three

28
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:51,100
and a half years into some sort of
security education for regular people

29
00:02:51,100 --> 00:03:00,410
that I run into in San Francisco where
to start with some story time I promised

30
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,948
in the talk abstract that there would be
similar to the rains so here it is a

31
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:10,359
while back I had the flu and I wasn't
bad now I was doing that like watch

32
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:13,680
every movie on Netflix that ever
happened even the ones you've already

33
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,829
seen thing and i got to hang in there
was the theme from Lord of the Rings it

34
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:24,340
was in the Fellowship of the Ring and
there is a whole group of dudes they had

35
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,260
a problem to solve so there is the
algorithm Hobbit service at work I think

36
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,138
he had an attitude and I was away third
guy and everybody was really crazy about

37
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:37,840
what color pat the wizard with wearing I
don't know any word that happens in the

38
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,380
world they all have this really big
challenges fault and part of it kinda

39
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,739
made me think of security team because
they all have really different skills

40
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,530
that was just that they had to find

41
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,359
invisible door after making their way
through some pretty dangerous territory

42
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:58,989
and if you paid attention to the movie
like it wasn't just dangerous territory

43
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:05,019
they happy like really kind of nasty
looking malicious actors like those

44
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:11,479
things are gross if you don't believe me
go check Google they're gross and one

45
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:14,799
thing got through all of that they were
at the base of a mountain looking for

46
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,220
door and it was this store which
probably talked about the door first of

47
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:29,580
all it was an invisible door so we know
that build invisible doors anybody and

48
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,719
the only people who knew how to really
find it with people who knew how to look

49
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,970
so that was kind of a regular thing and
architecture and in this case the people

50
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,139
looking for the door got lucky little
bit of starlight little bit moonlight

51
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:49,490
and boom it showed up not only did the
door show up there is the password hint

52
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,479
right in front of their faces and it's
up there and whatever that language is

53
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,050
you know carved into the side of the
mountain the bad password security

54
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:04,090
practice police don't put your hands in
the side of a mountain

55
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:11,020
the door comes up and the words speak
friend and mentor show up on it and then

56
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,400
you start same friend to the door but
they're brute forcing really isn't

57
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,190
helping

58
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,840
and neither the dictionary attacks they
try every single you know opportunity

59
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,150
that they have to throw the word friend
of the door doesn't happen doesn't know

60
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:32,760
this and they start thinking like ok we
just had a really big red team failed

61
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,729
this is kind of embarrassing thing we
need to get in here while attention to

62
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:43,120
detail one of the details was that even
though the door was built by dwarves the

63
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,120
tax was an hour so if you keep saying
the word for friend when everything is

64
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,100
written and Elvis would think it's gonna
happen do you think the door going to

65
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,930
magically like open if you type in the
wrong password no probably not so after

66
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,139
stepping back and thinking a little bit
they realized hey we're probably

67
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:07,760
speaking the wrong language here let's
try again so the user rightward her

68
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,870
friend which I'm not even sure not going
there today I'm not saying bye bye now

69
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,690
you're probably like what the hell does
this have to do with security outside

70
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,490
the doors the ability to document their
own doors back doors very juniper EF

71
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,120
them aside

72
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:35,570
security practices and besides I'm
really crappy brute forcing I mean

73
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,099
giving up a stone door with a wooden
stick that's not gonna work with the

74
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,740
team basically during the whole bunch of
really great pic kind of thankless work

75
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,060
to literally save the world bed they
live in from a whole bunch of malicious

76
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,479
crap and when they had an obstacle a
really really hard point they start

77
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,010
throwing a bunch of language out but
they're literally speaking the wrong

78
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:02,380
word to make sense of the situation and
to me because all I ever do is think

79
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,469
about security all the freaking time
this was a great metaphor for security

80
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,570
around because one thing that as
practitioners we tended deal is we get

81
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,539
security worried you know I had we get
technical word stuck in our heads and

82
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:20,150
then we go to the regular people that we
work with the regular people that we

83
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:26,210
live with and we're like yeah let me
vomit 25 technical word that you and

84
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,650
then asked why don't you understand why
is the heart why from this easier with

85
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,330
so hard about you know knowing the
difference between this encryption and

86
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,380
that encryption and this year and not
there so I don't know maybe to it

87
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,450
doesn't have anything to do with
security but to me it did because when

88
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,919
you look at the situation that we're in
is an industry no matter how many

89
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:49,090
defensive tools we use attackers can
still do pretty much whatever they want

90
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,690
without having to burn is your day or
without having to even really be any

91
00:07:53,690 --> 00:08:00,030
sort of you know technically leads to
break into practice so all of that being

92
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:06,840
said how do we fix it so one of the
first things that when we are talking

93
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,310
security training people we need to
realize is we need to step back and

94
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,160
figure out you know what do they know
what we need to realize most importantly

95
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,190
as they probably don't know much about
technology at all besides the on button

96
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,680
the off button and the how the hell do I
turn this off to make it doesn't spend

97
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,810
$1,000 on iTunes but there is not a
whole lot going on under the surface and

98
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,469
it's not their fault for the most part
people don't understand technology and

99
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:39,300
the vast majority of people we work with
and the kid

100
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,500
you know we know or that live around the
most people we encounter never had a

101
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,290
class that said so this is an API this
is what it means and this is how it

102
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:54,300
works so when we start talking about
well you hook the API to this and then

103
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,370
you have to make sure that the output is
sanitized and not the other

104
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,110
you lose the person that you are trying
to educate and you lose the person that

105
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,480
you're trying to communicate with so the
first thing you have to do is realize

106
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,230
like even if someone knows a little bit
of the lingo they probably don't have an

107
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,500
idea what's going on inside of this
silver boxy thing that we've all spent a

108
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,320
lot of money investing in even worse one
other thing that happens is when it's

109
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,149
time to have a conversation about
security with colleagues with kids with

110
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:31,570
family members typically people want to
know you know how to get online how to

111
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,390
adjust to this one really quick tap so
instead of really understanding the

112
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,390
series of steps that you need to take to
accomplish something online or to make

113
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,449
sure that you're doing the right thing
most people just want you know steps one

114
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,310
through ten you know step one go to this
page and look for the Spartans kept you

115
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,930
click this by three when the button is
clicked go put words into another button

116
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:58,370
the problem with that approach is for
wine especially on the security side

117
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,010
were not helping our users build
amendment old model of what they're

118
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,050
doing they get very dependent on
following an exact series of stocks and

119
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:12,660
then when the UI changes or interaction
goes away we suddenly have a huge

120
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,300
security problem because our users are
stuck by now we should all know that

121
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,719
usability is a security problem and when
we make people focus too much on the

122
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,430
steps to actually use software we're
doing them a really big disservice

123
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,349
because they don't really learn much
past look for this arrow and put these

124
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:39,890
five words and next we have a fine by me
here to explain that content is really

125
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,920
key when you have a user's attention or
you have a coworker's attention don't

126
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,660
throw it away when we're teaching it's
really important to know that people

127
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,219
learn best through personalized content

128
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,209
through storytelling and three
entertainment jokes work stories work

129
00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:00,709
people might not totally remember every
single word of his story but if you make

130
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,878
sure that you're telling a good story
about security and then you really know

131
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,769
about like last punch line the public
and remember that part they're probably

132
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,100
going to carry it with them and they'll
probably even repeat it to other people

133
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:18,050
which is even more important and other
thing that's really important to think

134
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,829
about to is one of the most important
documents that people get when they're

135
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:27,170
in a workplace or even students in
school they get handed an acceptable use

136
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:32,620
policy for these things are full of
legal these really like crazy technical

137
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,889
jargon and for the most part users think
that that's actually an educational

138
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:41,579
documents so you're acceptable use
policy can have all kinds of crazy

139
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:46,699
bastard ruled on it but because that use
policy at work is the most important

140
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:50,359
thing that they have to guide how
they're using technology we're probably

141
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,300
gonna carry some of those practices home
so for example if you have a really bad

142
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:01,559
use policy that says to put $2 signs in
the place of that the concert practice

143
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,680
I'm gonna take home because they think
that's good

144
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,420
the same thing for things like I thought
accounts or university login account

145
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,110
when a student fees that they're only
allowed to have 15 characters and they

146
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:19,350
have to have you know 5 stars 2 vowels
you know 13 we describe broken feelings

147
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:24,420
whatever they are going to carry . with
them into the other sites that the youth

148
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,199
and the other things that they do online
so maybe instead of just handing over

149
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:33,300
this big you know packet of legally you
try making it fun we know a lot about

150
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,689
what content actually works with people
we have this thing called the Internet

151
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:41,259
and maybe the security teams not the
best place to go to create the content

152
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:46,750
maybe you need to know to have friends
in marketing or to reach out to other

153
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,180
people in your organization who know how
to communicate but the most important

154
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,469
thing that you can do

155
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,160
content wise is to make sure that when
you're trying to educate and when you're

156
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,449
trying to share important lessons about
security that are really vital to what

157
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:02,979
you're trying to accomplish you make it
interesting

158
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:09,529
I mean all of us to keep click baby but
at the same time if I have 27 horrible

159
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:14,519
feeling about that prosperity me last
week and probably gonna click on it and

160
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,889
I'm probably gonna share it and I'm
probably gonna share it with someone who

161
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:22,649
needs to know about that more than I do
the same thing goes for you know making

162
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:27,149
videos finding you know security
reactions on tumblr that's a really

163
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:31,110
great one but if you make someone laugh
or you teach them something that they

164
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,339
don't expect to learn they will remember
it longer and the work that we do on the

165
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:41,320
security side will last longer

166
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,420
thing to think about when you're trying
to teach people about security or talk

167
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,699
about security in general is just the
examples that you're using I have a

168
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:54,319
little bone to pick with you will see
you on the next flight

169
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,060
most technical metaphors that we tend to
use right now rely on warfare I'm sorry

170
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,569
I didn't want a picture of people
cybering up there it's just it was too

171
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:08,459
much so I got all eighteenth-century on
you and you know a lot of other

172
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:14,869
metaphors that are out there tends to
rely on locks and keys so when you step

173
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:20,100
back and think about how the average
person works most people don't really

174
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,720
learn about war unless it's in history
class or it on the news or they play

175
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,870
games somewhere I do almost none of
those things so when people start

176
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,310
talking war to meet them sentence like
congress problem I don't want them

177
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:39,510
touching it nevermind by when it comes
to locks and keys those are interesting

178
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:44,149
and that probably works for the security
community because every conference I

179
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,690
think that's ever been to you has had a
lockpick this or you know an entire

180
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,680
track devoted to physical security
that's really fine but the average

181
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,260
person isn't going to understand you
know jargon about Loxton tumblers and

182
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,420
pics and all of these other crazy things
that were really good at doing so when

183
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,170
we sit around and talk about encryption
that way but is an encryption that carry

184
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,370
stuff Lake I heard about it on CNN the
other day that terrorists technology

185
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,450
rate no

186
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,620
and then you start explaining it through
the lock and key metaphors people like I

187
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,750
just way complicated like if I get
locked out of my house I just called

188
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:26,360
them and also deal with it so that's
probably not the best that metaphor you

189
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,110
can really be employing when you're
trying to get your point across and this

190
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,590
might seem a little boring actually
architecture when it comes to teaching

191
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:41,300
people about security the first problem
that we don't necessarily address is

192
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,839
that people don't understand technology
if the average person doesn't have a way

193
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,650
of figuring out how technology works and
it's this crazy abstract thing that's

194
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,360
kind of hard to get a feel for the best
thing we can start doing is using

195
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,580
universal and tangible examples of
things that people are very very

196
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,600
familiar with I don't know about anyone
in here but I've never met anyone who

197
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,230
has never been in a house or been inside
of a building so when I start having a

198
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:15,780
conversation about technology and I'm
like wow we decide so let's pretend that

199
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:22,350
this website lets a facebook facebook is
out and you have to fit 1.5 billion

200
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:29,030
people in it and other stuff and then
you have to have private rooms for all

201
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,140
of their conversation then people that
back in there like holy crap how would

202
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:39,370
you fit 1.5 million people and house and
secondly like the concept of a website

203
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,550
and all of the different things that you
used to glue all of these technologies

204
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:50,290
together and make them work becomes very
real one of the most important things

205
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,860
with architecture to is buildings have
different purposes so if these fuckers

206
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,530
to hold 1.5 billion people and all of
their crap and all of their private

207
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,970
conversations and have enough room to
step mom off in some corner somewhere so

208
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:08,150
that she stopped liking that if people
are going to understand the difference

209
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,920
between a website the comment to do
heavy lifting if you're like oh yeah

210
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,250
like a 10 you know we put a good day or
two just to see if this idea would work

211
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,310
you know to maybe protect us from
getting rained on

212
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,688
no big deal but people will understand
like different websites have different

213
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:24,480
purposes

214
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,429
another great thing to and from the
security standpoint you can really get

215
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:34,720
into the proactive parts of architecture
so buildings require planning if you're

216
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,910
doing it the right way you have to have
blueprints you have to have designed you

217
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,330
have to do you like math which I heard
is really hard so maybe I won't do that

218
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:49,600
but you have to do all kinds of filing
and really proactive thinking ahead and

219
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,459
you have to do planning good websites do
that stuff to there's a reason that when

220
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,710
people get a bunch of money and they go
and build real estate they're called

221
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,929
developers on the software side we get a
bunch of money we build technology and

222
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:08,570
we're called developers to the only
difference is you can see what they're

223
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,960
building and for us to just stop on a
whole bunch of screens and hope the

224
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,360
right thing happens at the end

225
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,309
another really interesting thing to
everyone has heard about the three

226
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:23,360
little pics they are very well aware of
the brick house with standing wins

227
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,649
better than six so if you can have
conversations about choosing secure

228
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,440
languages building a secure foundation
are getting those ideas across

229
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:39,090
architectures are pretty good place to
spot just start one of the questions I

230
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,010
ever had when I was in San Francisco and
went out for dinner one night it was

231
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,950
raining very rare brain is important
they haven't let it sit for five years

232
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:55,090
apparently but so software
vulnerabilities get in there like can we

233
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:00,418
just get developers stopped making them
and putting them in yeah that's how it

234
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,850
works I thought about it for a while
because there are a lot of different

235
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:10,469
things that you have to do to really get
something like a zero day and a piece of

236
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,929
software and purpose there's a lot of
things you actually have to do to get

237
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:19,510
one in there by accident too and I
realized one really good architectural

238
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,400
and building example was just so I'm
sitting there you know completely

239
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,080
drenched next to this little lady and
she lives down the street from issues

240
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,059
like this damn developers to hold them

241
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:38,789
I explained to her so they're basically
laying bricks when they're putting the

242
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:43,399
countdown for the site that you and you
know maybe one day someone wrote some

243
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:49,529
code and they put the wrong cricket you
know maybe they weren't measuring the

244
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:53,669
way that the bricks came out or maybe
someone makes them order wrong and you

245
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:57,620
had no idea that there was some sort of
structural flaws you know in the bottom

246
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,029
corner of that building or that website
that you're using and then one day

247
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:05,999
there's an earthquake and sadly there's
a giant hole right in the front of the

248
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:12,679
building she looks like a possible but
just pretty good for this old lady and

249
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,809
that's actually a really solid way it to
convey the concept of a while if there's

250
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:22,418
a zero day you have an unknown flaw you
have to have an event that really brings

251
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:26,759
to life that it happened and it exists
for you know if you're having issues

252
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,539
like explaining what that is and how it
works and how vulnerabilities get into

253
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:32,720
things

254
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,460
architectures a really good place to go
another example I really like to use is

255
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,860
actually the weather

256
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,949
something as mundane as the weather it's
not really scary it's not really

257
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,909
off-putting everyone has had the
experience of having to defend

258
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:55,460
themselves for a lament how many of us
last night were suddenly going for

259
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,169
whatever we could find to cover head
through the rain so having to actively

260
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:05,820
defend yourself from wind green fund set
up these are not new contract everyone's

261
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,279
done it we all wear clothes I hope you
all very close to me all regularly wear

262
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,350
clothes

263
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:17,428
but it's really important if you're
trying to get the concept of defense to

264
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:21,570
people to say like both neither times
that you also are defending yourself

265
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:25,480
from things that aren't code and you
know aren't silly things out in the

266
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,710
world if it's hot outside

267
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,549
you get a choice of what you're gonna
wear you get a choice of putting on

268
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:36,950
sunblock if you're hanging on the web
and you're going shopping and there's a

269
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,840
whole bunch of ads everywhere you know
go put on your HTTPS Everywhere your ad

270
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,659
blocker

271
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,150
basically and go / around the web and
have some fun if you build that kind of

272
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,809
model in to help people think about the
web you are much more likely to get

273
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:56,710
better results because it is like
something people are ready do in the

274
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,590
regular life and maybe everyone doesn't
wear rainboots you know maybe they grab

275
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,559
an umbrella maybe they grabbed my coat
maybe you know somebody likes to run out

276
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,408
of the house and I really giant further
by people understand the concept of

277
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:13,460
having to defend themselves from the
elements and locked the elements that we

278
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,770
have no control over on the web that we
have to think about defending people

279
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:25,710
from his while the other think you in if
you forget to put on a raincoat or you

280
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,919
forget to open an umbrella or you don't
have the right defensive tools there is

281
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,140
always something that you can do to
protect yourself you know I didn't bring

282
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:41,309
my umbrella on this trip but I could
grab a program I could grab my coat and

283
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:45,090
stick it over the top of my head I had
other options besides just sitting there

284
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,520
and getting totally rained on I can also
borrow someone elses umbrella if I

285
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:57,059
needed to and another thing to think
about when we're talking to people who

286
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:02,379
don't understand technology is a scary
picture sorry I'm not sorry is just

287
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,230
choosing how we frame the issues that we
have at hand so we have a great power

288
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,409
when it comes to influencing the people
that we work with and the people who are

289
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:15,840
around us more often than not the
average person tends to feel really

290
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,639
overwhelmed about being online and they
kill a hopeless because from one source

291
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,750
they get one set of advice and rules and
then from another source

292
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,220
you know there's something that just
completely conflicts with what they've

293
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:35,370
heard from someone they might trust a
good example of this I feel it everyday

294
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:40,678
but if you look at some of the coverage
on password managers and security a lot

295
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,990
of times there'll be like one teeny tiny
thing that's not really high and

296
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:50,740
criticality and it's a story somewhere
and suddenly every security practitioner

297
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:58,200
on Twitter says oh no password managers
are a nightmare know another thing that

298
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,730
we're starting to see a movie p.m. still
work ok not one might be legit anti

299
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,880
virus stocks ok sure why not

300
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,020
trust nothing ok that might work for
some people but if I'm in a new user

301
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,330
you'll just taken away all the things
that I thought were told that I had in

302
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:23,668
my arsenal and now it how am I supposed
to do more often than not people say

303
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:27,390
okay I don't know what to do and just
not going to do anything like I'm gonna

304
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:30,590
meet my password I'm gonna change it
every 90 days that whoever is in charge

305
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,389
of Active Directory doesn't come in and
kill me and that's it I'm not having

306
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:40,659
anything else to do with the security my
into a negative and being too focused on

307
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:45,880
some of the risks but using software
especially the ones that don't fit a

308
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,610
user's threat model really does nothing
to bring more people on our team it's

309
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:55,408
bad for our users an example I can think
of its really near and dear to my heart

310
00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:58,929
once upon a time I got trapped in a room

311
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:02,580
eight-year-old which if you have no
children it's kind of a nightmare

312
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:08,370
because girls are a little intimidating
my friend you know how to run out of the

313
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,979
room and would like to teach them
something about the internet you can

314
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,020
figure it out

315
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:22,570
encryption eight-year-old this was
actually meaning I walk in and like the

316
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,439
internet tonight I'm going to tell you
about a superhero

317
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,799
like superheroes the superhero it's
called encryption and its math that

318
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:38,549
people tried to make illegal if you're
like oh my god you can make math illegal

319
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:46,779
I am never doing homework again this is
so there are about the same thing I like

320
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:53,210
okay so what is it I know right where
you see that it's right here in the

321
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,789
clear they're like yeah what about it

322
00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:02,360
ok ok so we started rolling numbers
around it and I'm like you see them back

323
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,539
think it's like an invisibility cloak
now one of my rules for adults to never

324
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:13,980
explained technology in terms of magic
but when its eight-year-old and you are

325
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:20,679
fearing for your life you better use
them and the kids are okay how do we

326
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:26,429
know the superheroes so I don't know the
departmental you see this screen lock up

327
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:32,580
here but screen superheroes got you
covered the kids at the end of the

328
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:39,189
superhero doing ok put a word in the
word spread you can think of homework

329
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,690
was the worst part of the day I was like
wow your friends

330
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:51,539
superhero just took your homework word
that you thought was ugly hid it from

331
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:55,100
anybody else who might be trying to look
at what you're saying and make sure they

332
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:04,330
couldn't get the kids were like no we
don't think we should talk about that so

333
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:10,039
if you're wearing an invisibility cloak
what can go wrong this is really a year

334
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:16,309
olds are freaking brilliant white kid
goes alright so you can see you when

335
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:17,639
someone puts it on

336
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:21,908
and then you can see when someone takes
it up the kids just explained metadata

337
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:30,389
to meet you like eight so I'll call you
when I'm done another kid with flag wow

338
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:34,309
you could on it when you're walking
across the room you're trying to hide

339
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:39,609
from ppl ok absolutely I think that
there's some sort of technical equipment

340
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:46,178
tonight from where my favorite came with
like you could put on wrong if you're

341
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:49,969
trying to keep you up something in a
hurry you could totally put the PDP on

342
00:27:49,969 --> 00:28:00,509
wrong but the kid says and then your but
will be sticking out on the internet the

343
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:06,190
kids got encryption I was so excited
about this like not only did I get the

344
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,899
concept of secure browsing across to
them in their own language and in their

345
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:16,619
own words I went these kids were so what
are they doing look forward to lock up

346
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:18,570
there I'll look for the ass

347
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:22,829
eight-year-old their threat model is
literally themselves with the time if

348
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:26,959
not the kid sitting next to them lol
telling them to look for the lock and

349
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:31,639
telling them to look for the acts
actually works I didn't realize what

350
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:35,869
happened is that this classic
eight-year-old every time they went on

351
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:40,658
the internet for the next three months
we plan on to their teacher there's no

352
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:48,669
there's no next year

353
00:28:48,669 --> 00:29:00,809
there is no its kids and their teachers
teachers totally got the whole

354
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:03,850
invisibility cloak thing by the way
apparently this movie Harry Potter was a

355
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:10,029
big deal done by the relays that they
could start using HTTPS Everywhere which

356
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:14,570
comes from the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and basically forces FSL when

357
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,749
you're connecting to a site if it's
available so these kids looking for

358
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:23,239
their superhero looking you know for
that green power block looking for the

359
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:28,999
ass were so adamant about making sure
they had this at that they made their

360
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:48,019
entire school adopt HTTPS Everywhere and
then came back to security and there are

361
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:53,889
like we shouldn't talk about it what
about passing attacks you should talk

362
00:29:53,889 --> 00:30:01,678
about having a taxi should know about
that their aides exactly their crap

363
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,970
model is themselves and it got me
thinking now click click periods where I

364
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,159
knew exactly how to talk about this
thing important to me to a group of

365
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,289
eight year olds were gonna bug everyone
they know about it until you know I know

366
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:17,960
the end of their lives

367
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,799
I hope when I went back to my own
community and started having

368
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:29,330
conversations about it it was suddenly a
problem and not call and the reason that

369
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:35,658
I have thought about for a long time but
it was this as practitioners we really

370
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:40,100
want to be transparent and we really
want to be open with the people we're

371
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,590
trying to educate but perhaps we do it
to a fault it's ok if we are teaching

372
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,039
people stuff like I didn't teach about
passing attacks could I don't really

373
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,739
have to but it's ok when we're trying to
get people excited about what we're

374
00:30:53,739 --> 00:30:58,350
doing if we use a little teeny bit of
artistic license and

375
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:03,230
we get them onto our side it's not ok
for trying to get people excited about

376
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:08,630
security and then suddenly we tell them
everything that's wrong with all of the

377
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,020
steps that were teaching and all the
tools that we're trying to bring into an

378
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:18,389
organization or into our own homes it's
not going to say ok we're gonna do this

379
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:23,900
new security thing not if it's gonna
work who gets excited about security

380
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:29,900
when you put it like that so the day
when it comes to how we teach people how

381
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,610
we talk about things and how we freemen
we have a lot of choices and we have a

382
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:39,010
lot of influence and we have a lot of
sway a pic to last i doing seen here

383
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:44,789
because of 15 hell 15 looks pretty happy
and heavenly we kind of sit in the

384
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:50,110
middle between the technical people and
non-technical people and we do quite a

385
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:54,490
bit that influences whether someone's
experience learning about are trying to

386
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:59,049
implement security measures is going to
be hard or whether it's going to be easy

387
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:06,200
for them and kind of fun I'm pretty
certain someone out there is still

388
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,210
thinking that but it doesn't work

389
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:16,840
people do dumb stuff we're not going to
change that people don't always use

390
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,699
common sense we're probably not gonna
change that either we're not gonna be

391
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:26,200
able to fix it when we sit around and we
talked about how dumb people are and we

392
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,340
speak poorly of our end users are not
really taking any initiative to fix the

393
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,658
problems that we have it here and that's
a huge problem because it doesn't make

394
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:38,830
us smarter and it doesn't make them
smarter either if the one thing that we

395
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,710
do know is we come up with policies and
we've come up with all kinds of user

396
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,450
interfaces and our users still aren't
going to have an idea of what is going

397
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:54,340
on we can build things to fail safe and
Cetaphil our users all the time so maybe

398
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:59,439
instead of sites wiping and being dirty
about those Indian they're going to

399
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,760
completely ruin my policy no that's not
the right thing to do here when it comes

400
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,860
to security awareness and education

401
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,399
investment they don't scale really
easily it's gonna take time

402
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,370
gonna take patience and if you look at
the metrics are probably gonna be really

403
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:19,979
similar to what goes on in public health
education you know after decades of

404
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,630
health campaigns and heart disease and
snow game people still die of heart

405
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,670
disease among camper and all kinds of
other preventable illnesses but we don't

406
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:33,670
stop teaching people about how that
works and why we may not be able to

407
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:38,120
change everyone's behavior we can if we
are really persistent and patient which

408
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,209
is hard to do sometimes I completely
understand we can we can bring people

409
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,590
over to our team with a little bit of
persistence and just by building bridges

410
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:52,699
with people are organizations who are
non technical and who do come from other

411
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,309
disciplines have the skills that will
help us drive the message that we need

412
00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:02,850
to the people who need it the most
typically focusing on outcomes and

413
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,820
people is much more productive than just
focusing on the technology and the

414
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:10,609
technology work but when you look at
what's happening in our industry and our

415
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:15,739
organization and even Justin regular
plain old technology everyone is trying

416
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:20,270
to solve problems with code that are not
problems that can be solved with code

417
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,889
the stuff that we need to do in the
security side is not stuff that you can

418
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:29,600
go and build an epi for its not stuff
that you can go and build a quick web

419
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,509
app and tonight I nobody gets fish
anymore

420
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,190
will not be so much fun that's how it
goes

421
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:40,369
the stuff that we need to start doing is
paying attention to the people that we

422
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:45,750
work with we need to think about how to
educate them how to communicate to them

423
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,000
and how to make them care about the
stuff we're doing as security people we

424
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,830
already know that everything that we do
on so many different levels is vital for

425
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:59,640
how our world works we need to start
making it makes sense to other people

426
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,540
and we need to do it in ways that are
not scary that aren't off-putting and

427
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,590
that don't meet people run in the other
direction with their hair on fire if we

428
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,440
keep doing what we are currently doing
it's not only the definition of insanity

429
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,160
it's just not going to help us if you
look at what's going on in terms of

430
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,200
legislation

431
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,129
there are so many conversations all over
the world where people either want to

432
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:26,089
regulate what's going on with security
research they want to take away my boo

433
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:30,849
which is encryption by the way if you
call your password manager your bill

434
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:38,520
people like Bill how do we get 100 tip
you have streamed words to describe

435
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,509
friendship with software people will be
very curious and they will also one that

436
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:48,880
particular relationship that being said
there's so many people out there on the

437
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,460
planet who don't get what we do we're
like a whole bunch of wizard who are

438
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,670
doing all this magic scary stuff that
doesn't make sense and they don't want

439
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,070
any part of it and they're so scared of
it they would rather just

440
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,869
witch hunt and come after us with
pitchforks and torches and that of here

441
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:13,230
we have to say so if we do our own part
to be our best ambassador and to really

442
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:17,820
start talking about all of this very
weird hard security is hard I don't know

443
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,510
if you've been paying attention but if
we do everything we can to make this

444
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:26,720
easier in to make the average person
care about it we will have better

445
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,450
outcomes one thing that would be really
great if anyone has time to go read

446
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:35,598
another book just applying something
like the growth mindset to security

447
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,829
instead of saying that things are good
or bad and putting judgment on the back

448
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:48,180
for a second and say ok we can learn
anything if we work hard and I we can

449
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,810
get other people to be good at anything
if we encourage them to work hard enough

450
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:58,000
at it if you put in enough hours if you
put in enough time to build fluency and

451
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,290
to really get good at whatever you're
interested in or something like security

452
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,480
that you care about you can inspire
others to do the same and maybe we won't

453
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,900
have like six billion people trying to
figure out how to solve this

454
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,390
and drop a note on that but if it's
enough to get people to stop using the

455
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:19,078
same password on every single website
that ever existed on the whole planet

456
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,490
that gets us somewhere at the end of the
day if we're gonna keep this web thing

457
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:28,859
that we love we need both sides working
together we need the technology and we

458
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,200
need the users working together

459
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:35,390
either so if we can try to find the
right language and users and its peak

460
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:50,580
security with them and not to them in a
condescending way

461
00:37:50,580 --> 00:38:13,279
the question I have a lot of people try
and i've i've looked over some of their

462
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,970
attempts to do so by law one time that I
was involved everyone got really stuck

463
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:24,399
in the metrics like it didnt the content
kind of got lost when people were trying

464
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,590
to figure out well how do we have a 20
percent month-over-month improvement to

465
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:33,290
get you know the budget for that so i've
seen a sort of work but I haven't

466
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:46,860
personally done it myself the question
is whether I've seen any progress with

467
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:52,640
having educators help us teach so I've
done a lot of work with educators and

468
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,299
just getting them to realize like this
is the security 101 stuff you don't know

469
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:03,280
if enough of a challenge they get
excited about it these see why it's

470
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,820
important I typically educators focus on
getting kids to create content and to do

471
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,720
stuff online that they can great you
know something like 97% of people think

472
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,810
that security should be taught in
schools with technology and some people

473
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:23,850
argue that it is in digital literacy
curriculum but they just don't have the

474
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:27,980
funding and you can see all the time
schools will go on Twitter and they will

475
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,690
crowdsource you know bringing in an
author that the kids live or an expert

476
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,420
on finance or something like that from
Twitter when it comes to security

477
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,640
there's not one person in your average
school or in your average school system

478
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,000
who has that responsibility so there's
no place for that subject matter

479
00:39:46,000 --> 00:40:37,329
expertise to go from a technology
coordinator to a teacher

480
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:47,299
yeah it's kind of a big deal

481
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:51,410
know what that is and they will get
through their little content blocking

482
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,690
system in five seconds when they figure
out what's happening with it

483
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:15,150
yeah

484
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:28,540
necessarily an adversarial component
definitely when people you know get on

485
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,660
the internet and the first thing they
think its ocean am under attack and only

486
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:37,190
did was you know type in Google is just
not a good feeling so for me when I

487
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:44,050
choose example I go you know comment
mundane things and I try to make sure

488
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:49,350
overall like I'm not gonna be
overwhelming for mine I want the average

489
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:56,120
person even though we have all kinds of
crazy EPT crap going on I want people to

490
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,880
feel some sense of urgency when they are
using the web and to feel like they have

491
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,810
control even if the control is only a
youth secure browsing practices and a

492
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:10,210
password manager you know from our
perspective on the security side we can

493
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:13,600
say well it doesn't matter if you use a
password manager because you're aware

494
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,839
that's true but I still want my end user
doing this to carry stuff anyway even if

495
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:35,030
there's some other upstream attack yeah
thanks for not using the internet to

496
00:42:35,030 --> 00:43:20,869
them questions over here I'm sorry go
ahead

497
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:39,160
she had pitched the idea and they went
for it so yeah infographics actually

498
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:51,078
help believe it or not and Mac

499
00:43:51,079 --> 00:44:09,869
and it seems like someone over here has
some suggestions and I don't have any on

500
00:44:09,869 --> 00:44:14,759
hand I usually just keep a list
somewhere in my phone and a notebook or

501
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:48,210
something and see if they stick when I
try them on people

502
00:44:48,210 --> 00:45:08,130
all the way in the back over here

503
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:15,210
anyone else I never heard her say that
there is a repository in the UK but I

504
00:45:15,210 --> 00:46:06,830
didn't catch the oral the analogies
project over here and I messed

505
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:18,299
question how do you find that what
they're using a secure when we're moving

506
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,440
to more a piece environment that's a
great question for the most part when it

507
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,360
comes to apps like we can all complain
about them being walled garden and lysed

508
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,320
you know how to plug that thing in and
look for what calls its making and

509
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,480
whether they are encrypted there is
really no good way this is a huge

510
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,480
problem in education technology there
are a lot of conversations going on

511
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,280
right now about not spying on kids
except when you look at some of the apps

512
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,600
that are used in classrooms you have
mobile analytics kit and you can get

513
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,740
personal information about someone's
usage patterns from those kids and

514
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,910
that's a huge problem so if that's an
area that you are interested in or you

515
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:04,799
know people interested in and by all
means please pick up and do some

516
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,880
research because that is an area where
there's no as in no lock to look for and

517
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,480
it's literally just download this app
entrust be that gets a lot of trouble

518
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,330
when it comes to Android apps and
everything started moving in that

519
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:19,120
direction

520
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:52,460
anyone else we have a few more minutes

521
00:47:52,460 --> 00:48:04,200
and getting by and I think I probably
said something along the lines of

522
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,770
training tends to be you

523
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:10,680
you know focused on a big set of rules
for education is something that doesn't

524
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,390
necessarily happening from use policies
and other things it's something that

525
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:19,009
happens when you know you have used
someone or you educate them and getting

526
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:23,720
the brian is just being more positive
with users and making sure that you free

527
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:51,049
things in an exciting and fun way that
hit it I feel one way in the back

528
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:56,620
while if there's any doubt behind my
judgment call tonight really talk about

529
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:01,720
the adversarial nature of security there
is in and when I started when I started

530
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,500
cleaning security and some of these
terms like I always make sure within the

531
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:11,490
first 15 seconds I bring up now what can
go wrong because it's the what can go

532
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:18,149
wrong part that you know people say wow
that's a big deal but I don't really

533
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,520
have data backup

534
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,020
anyone else think maybe have time for
one more and then have to get off the

535
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:41,300
stage because the next talks coming in

536
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:50,170
the question there's not really
differently every state department of

537
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:53,670
education works differently and they all
get their federal money differently

538
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:59,140
there's not one unified way to do it the
best way is to realize that in the most

539
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:04,339
impact you'll have will take place at
the local level so if you go to your PTO

540
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,900
meeting your PTA meeting and you raise a
fit if you go to your school board

541
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,570
meeting and you ask them

542
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:13,640
defending my kids network what are you
doing to make sure that my kids data is

543
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:19,690
not getting dumped and sold by the
lizard squad pas that to happen after

544
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,150
the questions at the local level and
you'll get answers because if you go any

545
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:27,240
higher than that there's so many levels
of bureaucracy just nothing that

546
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:27,689
happened
