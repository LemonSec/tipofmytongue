1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,430
and everyone to and I'd like to welcome
professor near gershon filmed from the

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:12,070
MIT Center for bits and atoms where he's
the director he's going to talk to us

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,539
about some very interesting things and
said that I should mention that computer

4
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:21,359
science is probably the worst thing that
has ever happened to either computers or

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:34,899
science so that's what this paper from
your colleague at MIT Seth Lloyd a

6
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:41,340
calculated the universe can do tend to
the hundred and twenty ops I estimate

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,260
we've done 10:30 so fire so we have we
can do that tend to the nineteen more

8
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:53,019
time and what they want to talk about is
how we make those first few steps into

9
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:58,739
the rest of the available ops in the
universe so I'm gonna do this in steps

10
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,959
from near the fire so one step in his
connecting the Internet to think this is

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,500
a people I wrote with his student Rossi
kerkorian who went on to create

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,420
Twitter's platform and Danny Cohen I'm
curious how many of you know who Danny

13
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,420
Cohen is it's amazing so Danny this is
especially if they did for him in those

14
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,860
videos here to don't know Danny go out
this before Danny TCP and IP where the

15
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,909
same thing he was the person who said
routing a packet into Anglo controller

16
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:29,850
different things

17
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,548
littering the internet you may have
heard of most chip fab he started that

18
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:39,090
and you may have heard a voice he
started that his sister legendary things

19
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,590
figure within the creators of the
internet but outside of this group of

20
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,720
people that Latinos him so connecting
the Internet to things I think this was

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,500
the first thing called Internet of
Things this project with Rossi and dani

22
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,759
is left after that is that is PCs
centric I was talking with Daenerys in

23
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,720
animal behaviorist and in certain peter
gabriel about we are beings

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:09,649
seat centric in the internet peter was
playing music with great apes where that

25
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:14,400
this was a nursing mother and what
you're seeing is the first time she had

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:25,860
a keyboard music keyboard and then it's
Peter playing in the background

27
00:02:25,860 --> 00:03:36,110
in this is the first time she's in a
keyboard

28
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:49,760
and playing with great musicians and we
just did number eight devices to talk to

29
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,840
them into it led to a very serious
project to create an interspecies

30
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,800
internet and that's how i met a man and
then larry has been helping with this

31
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,240
project for cognitive animals to bring
all the tools of the internet so one

32
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,840
step further in connecting digital and
physical now to connect everything to

33
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,850
the Internet it breaks a lot of
assumptions of the internet and so did

34
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:18,480
do this for the plumbing we had to go
back and revisit things like source

35
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,000
routing network coordinates back
pressure flow control a lot of the

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,160
assumptions on the internet the don't
scale to this role of embedded devices

37
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:34,390
in the plumbing step after that is
that's all based on digital logic the

38
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,400
transistors were using have analyzed
degrees of freedom and there's a kind of

39
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,010
a false dichotomy between analogue and
digital this is the chip company that

40
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:50,630
sells digital problems but in the state
space of the analog system so digital

41
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:56,370
systems like a hypercube and computers
on the corners you can work in the space

42
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,590
of the digital problem but you can take
shortcuts and go through the interior

43
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,299
and by using analogue degrees of freedom
to solve digital problems you can have

44
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,160
significant improvement in things like
noise noise margin and power budgets and

45
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,760
links things like that and that's lyrics
in the conductor that was bought by

46
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,180
analog devices recently that analyzed
degrees of freedom then comes quantum

47
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,810
degrees of freedom so this is a project
I did with the group that was the first

48
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,889
implementation

49
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:29,569
of a non-trivial quantum algorithm this
was implementing Grover's algorithm for

50
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:33,330
search in the very early days of quantum
computing and this is done by using

51
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,180
nuclear spin dynamics and molecules and
then doing Hamiltonian engineering to

52
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,039
program this didn't spin coupling and
using the exquisite decoupling of the

53
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,789
nucleus destroy the quantum coherence
and so we got up to a few qubits with

54
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:50,909
this and then we developed a lot of the
post sequins techniques that are now

55
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:57,460
being used to scale superconducting and
I entrapped you gets it right now about

56
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:03,150
ten cubits in a maximally entangled
state like I'm showing here so next step

57
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,419
in his using condom degrees of freedom
but quantum mechanics can do much more

58
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:15,378
than that this was people we showed you
can compute cryptographic hash functions

59
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:20,589
in the mesoscopic late scattering limit
that's the limit where you're coherent

60
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:26,089
scatter many times within the coherence
limit so for about a penny you can

61
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:31,839
allocated Teradata random data that you
can query with an optical hash function

62
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,259
it has exactly the properties you think
of it the hash function that then be on

63
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:42,680
national technical means to falsify the
token so given that kind of richness

64
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:50,060
this is how a computer scientist
classifies the world of computation and

65
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:58,080
two assists like me it's really silly in
the world we live in a patch of reality

66
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:05,680
occupy space it takes time to transit
its stores and you can interact and

67
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,389
that's all there is that really is the
only model of computation that's reality

68
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:14,139
and everything else is the kind of
pretend section that's erected on top of

69
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:21,949
that so you can call this the central
dogma of computing you write a program

70
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:25,840
then you make an object code

71
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,299
then you make an executable and then you
make a processor and they have nothing

72
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:36,430
to do with each other so why do we do
that this is the building I work in you

73
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,940
can go from the building to the street
to the city to the state to the country

74
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:45,410
you zoom its hierarchical but you don't
choose to remap the geometry of the map

75
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:53,440
that each level of the Zune this is how
I would portray the state of computing

76
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,389
in in in Metropolis to use a computer is
to be in the garden dancing up and then

77
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:02,770
somewhere in the basements and that he
is singing the levers around to make

78
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,849
something work and you don't know who
they are and their business areas people

79
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:11,380
in the basement and that's roughly we've
come to in computing now why should you

80
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:11,960
care

81
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:18,630
well if you look at something like
Hartley it's all about things that are

82
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,530
supposed to be far apart

83
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,909
up in the garden top actually being
close together down in the basement

84
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:31,350
things that are distant in computing
space being nearby and physical CDs and

85
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,650
this would have no way to capture that
notion that you're far about in

86
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,949
computing space but you're a Jason in
physical space of buffer overflows all

87
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,919
of that is about where you it's like the
matrix where you go from the red pill or

88
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,620
The blue pill or The blue pill to the
red pill right at that boundary is where

89
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:56,830
the stuff happens or supercomputers are
you know the power of a CD and there's

90
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,810
really two this tape or insights on how
to program parallel computing how to use

91
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,500
multicore programming well and if you
look at the numbers this is a paper

92
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,720
looking at it you computing devices
information goes in and information goes

93
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,060
out and power goes in and out and you
ask how much power you need

94
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:21,489
thermodynamically to transform the
information about seven orders of

95
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:26,300
magnitude loss from the logical work you
need to map the bits to what the

96
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,500
computer actually does and again because
there's this remote abstraction with

97
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,840
what the what we're doing compared to
what the devices

98
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:46,930
actually do so I blame to people I blame
him and the blame him is the touring

99
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:53,010
machine which was never meant to be an
architecture is very unfair and the

100
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,280
mistake made in the Turing machine is
the head is distinct from the tape

101
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,930
meaning the storage of information is
distinct from the interaction of

102
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,660
information and if you go back to the
physicist model of computation storing a

103
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,839
state and interacting a stator the same
thing the night decomposable but the

104
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,370
model of competition is storing estate
and interacting estate are unrelated

105
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,340
resources

106
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,340
your your computer spends much more
power refreshing the memory which isn't

107
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,910
considered computation because that's a
different system from the one that does

108
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:33,310
the interaction so that's earnings
mistake and I blame him and I blame him

109
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:37,349
for taking roughly Turing's architecture
and turning it into a computer

110
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,230
architecture which is now at most of
your career 7 stanton but the important

111
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:49,710
thing to know is why I didn't know
marvin minsky selected asked him what

112
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:55,060
johnnie thought and Johnny did a lot of
profound things and the von Neumann

113
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,479
architecture wasn't one of them he
didn't consider one he didn't write on

114
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,710
it as one of them it's really only in
one place it's in this report the dress

115
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:11,510
to put in the ad and it's the end I'll
estas the kind of barely worked and he

116
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,410
wrote this report on how to make the
pile of stuff kind of work and so what

117
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,959
he's done is he's enshrined touring
mistake in this architecture of these

118
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,650
processing organs that are distinct
that's really only written in this memo

119
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,060
on a pile of stuff that's long since
obsolete so in effect when you sit down

120
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,410
at a computer and you use a programming
tool you're you're you're carrying the

121
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,949
baggage of this vac with you and really
never wrote about that are talked about

122
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,920
it is a deep insight into computation
it's just a hack that we were decades

123
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,979
passed its due date that we've been
living with so what to do this is a

124
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:56,080
project where he looked at could you
take physics and respected at all levels

125
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,850
of description in computation and so
they're about twenty antecedents to this

126
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,020
is a whole very interesting parallel
histories from Maxwell's is a large to

127
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,270
Bennett Landauer sort of a parallel
history of economic computing look like

128
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:16,920
physics and so the idea is conceding is
geometry that takes time in space and so

129
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,240
that worked up to be implemented the
blogs and high performance computing in

130
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,620
a model of computing where competition
is asynchronous propagation through

131
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,990
geometry and so state lives in Tolkien's
that travel through the geometry and its

132
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,680
hierarchical in modular and so this is
very much like the Google Maps do now

133
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,689
you can fly from a program through all
the levels of description into the

134
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:50,210
physics and back out again respecting
time in space and geometry and in a

135
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,930
world like this a lot of the things that
are hard and confusing get easy you

136
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,250
don't have to figure out how to make it
parallel cause everything happens

137
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,790
everywhere all the time

138
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,140
everything runs as fast as the
underlying medium and things that are

139
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,930
dissonant computational spacer distant
in physical space so it doesn't solve

140
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,589
everything has a lot of work to come but
a lot of what's hard about computing get

141
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:17,600
easy if you respect time and space
throughout the computation and so I'm

142
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,790
really coming to the conclusion that we
should just do a do over we had a good

143
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:29,719
few decades but it's really in the state
that computing software doesn't

144
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,410
represent time and space and not only is
there no good reason to do it at the

145
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,680
source of a lot of the problems and you
can do it you can propagate time and

146
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,620
space through computation and it
simplifies the lot of its really hard

147
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,970
about computing so are you doing a do
over

148
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:50,029
this things like building routing
kernels in it that have all of these

149
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:56,959
properties of your building high level
programs as geometry not code and then

150
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,750
you can design cells in the
computational geometry where r cells

151
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,920
create and destroy cells and so this is
an exponential San out of a of a program

152
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:20,479
creating parts of a program

153
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,130
now I complained about 10 min entering
but to be there at the end of their

154
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:30,320
lives both of them reached exactly this
plane touring ended by studying

155
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,269
spatio-temporal pattern formation and 19
min ended in these not really quite

156
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:42,040
published notes looking at how to make a
machine that makes itself to make a

157
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,490
computer that can construct itself
ultimately he was interested in

158
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:52,190
foundation of what is life but they were
looking at exactly these questions about

159
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,490
how do you bring geometry back into the
representation of computation it was

160
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,260
purely theoretical cause you couldn't do
it at the time but they had just reached

161
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:06,120
that point but we can do it now so this
was a project with the students were

162
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,680
implemented universal high-speed video
universal computing in microfluidics so

163
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,229
this is a wonderful memory of it is a
bubble and it toggles and then this is

164
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:29,769
high-speed video these are logic gate in
so slowed way down but we're one bubble

165
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:34,050
appears to bubbles appear they interact
and go both ways and so one bubble and

166
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:39,189
probe for the existence of another
bubble this is a ring oscillator this is

167
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,199
a synchronizer these are all the
elements you need to do universal

168
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:50,060
digital logic nonlinearity gain an hour
but now its transport material as well

169
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:54,880
as information and see you can actually
make physically reconfigurable computers

170
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,920
in if you know how to do digital logic
you then know how to program political

171
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,860
logic and that's leading up to

172
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:10,730
is really a third digital revolution
Shannon if you haven't read it

173
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,449
wrote the best masters thesis ever this
is at MIT and in his master's thesis

174
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:21,920
roughly he invented digital it's a good
pieces shown is the universality

175
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,920
digital logic is very generous in
crediting the lineage of in this whole

176
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,990
path before him but that was the
master's thesis and then when he went on

177
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:38,339
to do at Bell Labs one of the few things
is threshold arrows and so the real

178
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:44,680
meaning of digital is a threshold and a
threshold theorem and easy way to see it

179
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,310
is if I give you a token and there's an
error rate there's an error if they give

180
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:56,329
it to you three times in new majority
vote there are three ways to fail two of

181
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:58,779
them have to go wrong and there are
three ways to fail and then if you

182
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:03,420
majority vote to the majority vote and
then you workers on that what you find

183
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:11,589
is the error rate is exponential in the
words eyes and that as long as the noise

184
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:16,448
is below a threshold which is two-thirds
in this case and so that exponential is

185
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:20,990
one of the only exponentials in all of
engineering for noise below a threshold

186
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:26,900
if I send you a symbol the error rate to
decode it goes down exponentially in the

187
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,549
physical resources representing the
symbol that's what digital means an

188
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:38,340
interesting historical lesson is that's
what Shannon did at Bell Labs once

189
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,879
removed I didn't know him but Bob Luckey
was there and he told me that they spent

190
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,540
about a decade fighting over whether the
phone system should be analogue or

191
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,770
digital because there is over into doing
this digital stuff and that the good

192
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,660
life lessons from that I learn from Bob
Luckey is that the data was won by death

193
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:00,120
the analyte managers died and the
digital managers took over and that's

194
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,219
how we have digital communication but
the real meaning of digital is this

195
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:12,250
threshold property so then this is what
Veneman did consider profound he

196
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:18,720
literally directly applied Shannon to a
computation so view a computation as a

197
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,850
symbol communicating through the
computer and he showed you could compute

198
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,129
reliably with an unreliable computing
device

199
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:32,770
by transporting a symbol that then has
these coating properties just before he

200
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,710
did that

201
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,020
Vandiver bush at MIT made the last great
analogue computer room full of tears and

202
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:45,500
police it gets worse with time by nine
min showed you can compute reliably with

203
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:51,040
an unreliable computing device which is
then the base of computing possible so

204
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,550
those in the first two digital
revolutions at that same time Norbert

205
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,570
Wiener servo mechanism lab made the
first numerically controlled milling

206
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:05,110
machine this was the berlin computer as
part of Project stage which was in the

207
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,750
air defense computer which was really
the first large-scale real-time computer

208
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,100
and there is this epiphany that to make
aircraft parts you could make by hand

209
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,169
you could connect the real-time computer
entering the cranks on the machine so

210
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:22,460
you could date computer controlled
fabrication to 1952 but it doesn't

211
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,860
belong on the slide and it doesn't
belong on the slide because the state is

212
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,320
in the computer on the machine you just
have metal whacking away at mental

213
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,620
errors accumulate there's no state in
the system the really interesting

214
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:41,419
transition now to program reality is to
actually hold construction by putting

215
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,650
information into materials so few years
ago and the meeting with the white house

216
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,590
on this emerging science of fabrication
again it's not digital designs of

217
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:56,209
physical things that had actually put
coding and computation into the

218
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:02,190
construction of things and they're at
this site there's videos and in talks

219
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:07,650
that show snapshots of that and that's
what I'm going through now in steps it

220
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:13,660
progresses from a computer controlling a
machine like 1962 to the second step is

221
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,810
rapid prototyping of rapid prototyping
machines so rather than a rapid

222
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,250
prototyping machine like the laser
cutter that made our tags you can do

223
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,820
rapid prototyping of the rapid
prototyping machine this is a fine

224
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,860
example show you this video is a

225
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,610
Nadya peek who's been working on using
rapid prototyping tools to make modular

226
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:50,428
construction kids of rapid prototyping
tools and ideas and he's doing is

227
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:58,309
cutting out parts with the reputation
shaping tool then the machine is

228
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:04,020
stateless it's a modular real-time
network and so you make machine modules

229
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:10,668
each module is a physical object but its
mirrored in the saucer object so then

230
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:14,010
when you connect the physical machine
objects you're also connecting the

231
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,440
software objects and synthesizing a
control system and we all talk at the

232
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,720
end of a global lab network I run and we
sent these parts out to the user's

233
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,160
machine building all over the world they
had a week to make a machine and so this

234
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,910
is what beginners did in a week with
modular Machine building kits this is a

235
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:46,200
Japanese or Korean calligraphy machine
this is a 3d scanner

236
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,030
marble Late Show added this is a
multi-axis hot wire cutter more

237
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:58,420
seriously lays so all of that leads up
to the idea that very close from now

238
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,730
rather than acquiring a rapid
prototyping machine the machine itself

239
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:07,270
becomes harder objects during soccer
objects and it could be three or four or

240
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:12,530
five axis are open or closed loop but
the machine is flexible as the projects

241
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,770
you make with the machine in it you do
rapid prototyping of rapid prototyping

242
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:22,670
machines but the step after that is much
more important and that's think of Lego

243
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:29,330
LEGO brick the tower you make is more
accurate than the motor control of a

244
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,850
child because you can detect and correct
errors in the placement you can join

245
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:38,649
Lego bricks made out of dissimilar
material you don't need a ruler to place

246
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,930
Lego the local constraints give you the
global system and when you're done you

247
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,790
don't put Lego in the trash you can
reuse the components and those are

248
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:53,430
really exactly the lessons Shannon and
19 min taught us but now physically so

249
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:58,810
the next step is not cutting or
depositing but assembling and so this is

250
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:14,060
a micro in assembler idea what this does
is it assembles bricks of it as a

251
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:19,440
feedstock of micro Lego bricks and
adjust places them roughly and then

252
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,670
snaps than it together and it does coded
construction of 3d volumes made out of

253
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:33,280
micros logo and so this is killing Lego
down to nanometers the smallest made

254
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,990
about a hundred nanometers and then with
just a conducting an insulating and a

255
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,190
resistor brick with three bricks
digi-key stocks 500,000

256
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,629
sister types that very informed Dr and
value and current reading we can make

257
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:51,199
that with an inventory of three parts

258
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,080
resisted conducting an insulating brick
if you then add semiconducting bricks

259
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,009
you can start to make logic and
three-dimensional electronics that's

260
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:05,070
completely reversibly assemble and then
this is a really nice design to a

261
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:10,668
student Amanda Cass I designed to design
electronics out of micro Lego so this is

262
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:15,750
an RFP parts of North matching network
so she's taking conducting an insulating

263
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:21,059
bricks placed divining hierarchical
modules then turning them into the

264
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:29,220
actual geometry analyzing the
conductivity modeling the physics and

265
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,440
then exporting a Construction Co to the
assembler a shoujo and so these are the

266
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,389
building blocks of the analogue to CAD
CAM and machine control but now her

267
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:44,168
world of discrete construction of
electronic brakes on a bigger length

268
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:50,179
scale two years ago we showed you can
make the highest performance ultra late

269
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:55,149
material to make airplanes in space
structures not by having a tool the size

270
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:58,830
of this room to make a carbon fiber
parts the size of this room but the

271
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,549
making little tiny carbon fiber loops
and then linking them locally into

272
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:06,639
cellular structures that you build
globally and so that lets you do stuff

273
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:11,850
like this is a wing made out of those
parts where you can dial up and you can

274
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:19,928
change shape and then this is a robot
design where the old the last assembler

275
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:23,220
showed you was smaller than what its
building now is bigger than what its

276
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,870
building now this is a robot that small
compared to its building so all I can do

277
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:31,590
is add or remove a loop of carbon fiber
make a step forward or backwards but

278
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,699
they doing that locally you can build
global structures with that we're

279
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,960
working very closely with the aerospace
industry to make to essentially take out

280
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,440
the whole twenty billion dollars supply
chain to make aerostructures directly

281
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,409
assemble them so from there the next
step in this is where it starts to get

282
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:48,360
really interesting

283
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,370
thing is this is designed to addict
designed for an assembler that assembles

284
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:58,449
the assembler so this is now an
assembler of the digital materials and

285
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:03,880
when I say digital material what I mean
is a discrete set of parts reversibly

286
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,840
linked with a discrete set of relative
position and orientation to get these

287
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,090
attributes you can locally detect and
correct errors you can join dissimilar

288
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:17,860
materials local geometry defines global
geometry and you can reuse the parts and

289
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,899
where this gets really interesting is
this is an appeal later is staged a

290
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,090
clamp these are made out of the parts
that they assemble and so what we're

291
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:31,230
working up towards is an exponential
ring up the assemblers that can assemble

292
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,530
assemblers out of the parts they're
assembling and it turns out for scaling

293
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,370
and I talked about this in a little bit
that's essential you need assemblers

294
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:46,719
assembling assemblers to scale and then
the final step down that path is this is

295
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,730
now the inverse of protein folding this
is the mass to turn a one day code into

296
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,500
a 3d shape based on local information
it's solving the Hamiltonian path

297
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,059
problem that Cindy complete but you can
see divide by two spatially and then you

298
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:06,600
can decorate just read it off and so
this lets you directly turn 21 decode

299
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:13,030
into a 3d shape one of the leads
students on that this is a segment of a

300
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:18,220
really interesting robot he made to do
that and electromechanical system this

301
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,370
is based on an electric permanent
actuator which is a hard magnet biasing

302
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:28,649
a sauce magnet in a motor that gets high
torque at low rpm with static holding an

303
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,760
invention that just because this was our
economic in and if you heard of Google's

304
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,379
Project this is the RO project are and
this is the mechanism used to put the

305
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,429
modular phone together but here now
finally is the math of how to actually

306
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:47,450
turn codes directly into
three-dimensional shapes and what that

307
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,470
leads up to

308
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,090
is

309
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:54,120
it looks an awful lot like biology and
not by accident it's not that we're

310
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:59,750
copying biology but you can think about
it as Borat engineering up reverse

311
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:04,130
engineering biology doing sort of good
engineering receiving out why biology

312
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,020
does what it does so this is the
ribosome that's my favorite machine it's

313
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:14,230
the protein that makes proteins
messenger RNA comes in it the mRNA has

314
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:19,900
all the properties of a good modern code
tRNAs bring in the amino acids amino

315
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,380
acids are exactly like molecular Lego
and then the ribosome iteratively

316
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:29,880
assembles them and said you look at the
numbers chemical synthesis has an error

317
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,350
rate of about a part in the hundred the
ribosome makes an error rate of about

318
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:39,370
apartment into the floor because you can
air eject the tRNAs and then DNA

319
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,939
synthesis is more sensitive so it it it
it spends a thermodynamic cost to do an

320
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,680
extra step of error correction in DNA
copy has an error rate of attended the

321
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:54,140
eighth and that this exponential scaling
the exponential scaling that gives you

322
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,540
exponential complexity which in this
case is you

323
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:03,580
comes from the ribosome just isn't just
a code describing a thing the code is

324
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:09,439
the thing the code becomes the thing its
coding discrete construction of Eric

325
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,460
Eric coated materials and it's not a new
idea I didn't think of that it's a four

326
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,510
billion years old idea that the
evolutionary age of the ribosome in its

327
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:23,090
most concerned part of biology but we're
coming to appreciate that the real deep

328
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,399
meaning of digital fabrication again
it's not a computer controlling a

329
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,420
machine actually putting the codes into
the materials what's new now is we're

330
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:37,010
ready to start building things that work
like ribosomes but in material systems

331
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:44,070
that don't exist in biology like high
electron mobility electronics

332
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,179
full of these machines this is how you
smell this is how your muscles where

333
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:56,500
this is how you think all of those are
made in codes from the right and the

334
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:02,840
really amazing lesson is this the
ribosome assembles twenty amino acids

335
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,639
and they're completely unremarkable
they're just not special one is basic

336
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,480
one is acidic when its hydrophobic and
hydrophilic it's not the most

337
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,720
hydrophobic it's not the most
hydrophilic and it's not all the all the

338
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,530
degrees it's just an example of each but
with that basis set of 20 parts thats

339
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:28,190
good enough you can make all of this and
so it's an inventory of 20 parts and I

340
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,610
estimate we should be able to do all of
modern technology with an inventory of

341
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:39,919
20 parts with conducting an insulating
brick I can do

342
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,110
PCBs instead of catching traces with
layers with the I can assemble PCBs and

343
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,350
I showed you that already and I can do
the connectors and I can do the wiring

344
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:52,530
in a canoe the case with one extra
partner resistive part I can give you

345
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:57,139
any resistance value then with lately
and heavily doped N&P type

346
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:02,110
semiconductors I can give you logic and
redoing prototype transistors then there

347
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:07,389
you want a ferromagnetic
antiferromagnetic brick in a piezo

348
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:12,130
electric brake and around 20 or so
bricks we should be able to reproduce

349
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:17,130
just about all of modern technology in
the same way that biology is based on

350
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:26,600
twenty amino acids tom whitehouse LSD P
wrote a really interesting

351
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,510
position piece on what does it take to
bootstrap the civilization what are the

352
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:35,929
minimum building blocks the way I like
to describe this is you can't bring

353
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:41,179
colonize space and bring luggage so what
are the minimum building blocks you need

354
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:45,679
to go out into space in the complete
civilization

355
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,980
it's a very provocative question but the
work that's been done to date on this

356
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,080
roughly looks like this if you're not
familiar with these I adore these books

357
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,199
by David gingery it's a series of books
where you start with a charcoal and iron

358
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,870
ore and then you end with the machine
shop and so you make a furnace melting

359
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:07,678
metal and you work up to hand tools and
eventually get to a machine shop and

360
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,360
this is essentially been the model of
how we colonize space Yuri construct the

361
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,549
whole industrial revolution in biology
there is a mistake in historical notion

362
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:24,860
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny which
is the idea that the embryo goes through

363
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,620
all the stages of development up until
the present but we sort of in trying

364
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,389
that technology the assumption we need
to recreate the industrial revolution to

365
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:37,330
progress and was coming out of this work
is a very different model it's it's it's

366
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,559
it's it's more like the birth of life
that that you bootstrap the civilization

367
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:46,490
in the same way life of all but now with
inorganic as well as organic building

368
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:54,120
blocks and so stepping back now there
were mainframe computers millions of

369
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,199
dollars this is one of my favorite
pictures it's Ken Thompson and Dennis

370
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,659
Ritchie at Bell Labs inventing Unix and
what's important about this picture is

371
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:06,679
this is when a computer went from a
whole organization down to a worker went

372
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:11,490
from a million dollars $200,000 and then
tens of thousands of dollars so they

373
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:17,419
could have a vision of Unix without
having to get management by this is the

374
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:22,460
Altair and after people like me the
Altair was life-changing was the first

375
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,090
personal computer and the killer app for
it when it came out was you would slip

376
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:30,090
switches on the panel to load a program
you would run it and then the binary

377
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,178
late and that was it

378
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,190
and was life changing

379
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:39,779
whole generation was transformed because
it wasn't useful but it was personal and

380
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:47,649
then we get the PC the PC to be clear is
profound in that if any of you date back

381
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:52,320
to programming at PDP it was in a
computer there is a process Iraq and a

382
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,928
storage rack and I O and cables and as a
whole bunch of stuff you needed to get

383
00:33:55,929 --> 00:34:00,490
all the stuff working with the PC did
was put in here a graphics system in a

384
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:05,580
storage system and i/o system and power
conditioning system and a switch so you

385
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:11,078
can flip it on as if it's a monolithic
thing so you understand that history and

386
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:17,270
the important lesson is the internet
emerged roughly here not after the

387
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:22,909
iPhone the internet emerged at the
transition out of the PDP now let's look

388
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:30,139
at the this 11952 first and see mill
millions of dollars a research lab like

389
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:34,629
mine at MIT has these million dollar
tools gonna tell you about these fab

390
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:40,899
labs these are like the mini computers
then using machines to make machines are

391
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:45,270
not yet useful but they but they do work
that the obvious computers and I just

392
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:49,810
spent about half an hour on the research
roadmap to the replicator

393
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:54,250
replicator we're now coming to
appreciate is it it's all about

394
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:58,240
embodying computation in the materials

395
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,598
very amusing when he's writing his book
about who is imitating who and we

396
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,500
couldn't help but the road map to the
replicator is about him by the in

397
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,329
computational materials now we're about
here right now we're right at this

398
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:20,740
transition roughly from the minicomputer
to the hobbyist computer and I got that

399
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,759
when I had all of these machines and
would take a lifetime to learn to use

400
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,670
them so I started teaching a class
called how to make almost anything and

401
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,710
that was aimed at just 22 research
students to learn to use the tools

402
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,670
ads and I was alarmed when hundreds of
students showed up begging to take it

403
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:41,710
then they would say this looks to useful
are you allowed to teach it at MIT and

404
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:47,010
they went on and they did projects
integrating their skills so the first

405
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,869
year when the stars Kelly a sculptor
with no technical background this was

406
00:35:50,869 --> 00:36:59,460
her semester project

407
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:10,490
ability this year old child they go
crazy left home alone this is an alarm

408
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:15,310
clock you wrestle with and prove you're
awake this is the dress instrumented

409
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,560
with sensors and spine that depends your
personal states have somebody gets too

410
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:25,340
close and this was happening so
consistently I realize these students

411
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:29,760
were answering a question hadn't asked
which is the deep inside emerging as

412
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:36,170
digital fabrication but hadn't asked who
cares what's the purpose of digital

413
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,080
fabrication and the answer the killer
app for digital fabrication is personal

414
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:45,430
fabrication just like computing so going
back to the history from the world in

415
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:51,790
computer for the presidency mill MIT
made the TX series which are among the

416
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:56,600
first transistor as computers the
transistor eyes computers the TX series

417
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,180
were commercialize has the DEC PDP T's
CD keys are used to create the Internet

418
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:06,339
can also head of Dec famously said
nobody needs a computer in the home and

419
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:13,310
decades twice over bankrupt jackpot buy
compact bought by HP Wang crime data

420
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:18,980
general Dec the whole computer industry
128 they all died when the PC came the

421
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,380
organizational lesson is it didn't
matter what you did with organizational

422
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:29,130
change they were just all doomed that
they all got the peace Iran but you

423
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,590
don't have the PC at home to do
inventory in payroll you have to do what

424
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:37,760
makes you you until the same sense the
point of all of these are to reproduce

425
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,170
that you can buy a Walmart its unique
but you can't buy a Walmart its personal

426
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:46,480
production for market of one person he
sees didn't make mainframes obsolete is

427
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,560
crucial functions for that that's a lot
of what you do for a living but there's

428
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,259
this

429
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,580
you interact with computing close too
close to the users and then it goes up

430
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,970
through the hierarchy and the same thing
is true for fabrication

431
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:04,899
and so around that period an accident
happened congress passed a rule of

432
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,890
government agencies have to measure
social impact I got a giant and its

433
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,920
Afghan to bio

434
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:17,040
granted I want one of every machine to
make anything and got an assist on a

435
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:26,170
good day and but and this rule has
passed and so and it's after into big

436
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,430
grin tease and said yes to measure
social impact I had no idea how to do

437
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:33,649
that but it's not the machines were cool
and so inspired by that historical

438
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:39,600
analogy it's going to be about 20 years
to make the replicator and understand a

439
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,920
3d printer is remote from that the
replicator bills complete functional

440
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,560
systems from Adams on up but today you
can emulated with about 2 tons and

441
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:57,730
$100,000 so we have every picture here
this actually this is this lab is

442
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:01,160
investment charity seen the pictures of
a town being destroyed by the volcano in

443
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:07,470
Iceland it's this but they're okay the
end what's in here is two tons of stuff

444
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:11,529
$100,000 it includes 3d printing and
scanning precision machining laser

445
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:15,490
cutting large format machining composite
layup surface mount rework embedded

446
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:21,120
programming scanning all of that and if
you view all about his machine data

447
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,759
concerning you can make anything or
objects come in and it comes out and we

448
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,420
set up one of those for NSF to check off
this outreach box and then we're going

449
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,910
to go back to the lab and work and at
last count about a thousand doubling

450
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,230
time is a year and a half

451
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,550
there in every part of the world war
zones in shantytowns above the Arctic

452
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:44,760
Circle functioning as a global network
of Fab Lab and it's exactly like the

453
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,130
spread of the Internet the internet
appeared to be a revolution from 12 to

454
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:54,110
24 28 posts in for a decade you could
just plot that and then it disappeared

455
00:40:54,110 --> 00:41:00,390
suddenly something happen in the same
sense even doubling for a decade and it

456
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:04,790
let anybody make anything anywhere and
if you can do that it's fundamentally

457
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:11,259
challenges a lot of assumptions so work
you leave home to go to a place you'd be

458
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:17,380
doing something designed by somebody you
don't know to make something for

459
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,690
somebody you'll never see you then go
home and get money and get something

460
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:25,870
that you want but if you could just make
what you want for the basic assumptions

461
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:30,859
about money and work it is not free but
if you remove all of those steps and

462
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,910
remove it down to the incremental
building blocks it really changes what

463
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:40,509
is money in what is where this is the
mayor of Barcelona Barcelona has a

464
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:45,660
fabulous design sense and 50% youth
unemployment a whole generation can't

465
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,450
work and so this is a project with her
putting these fab labs in every district

466
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:54,430
of the city as part of urban
infrastructure you the city provides

467
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:58,230
electricity or clean water and this is
now the means to create rather than

468
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,180
buying products made far away in sending
trash to trash dumps the city as part of

469
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,100
urban infrastructure can create what it
consumes

470
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:10,069
alleged that is this is a white house
makers sources text is celebrating

471
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:14,710
making but the subtext is a lot of
American manufacturing is weighing prime

472
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,110
in data general index and isn't gonna
survive this transition the new jobs

473
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:23,590
aren't coming back to the old factories
then this is a project where we had

474
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:29,160
bright kids in African villages coming
in learning to do surface mount rework

475
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,290
and embedded programming and
three-dimensional parametric design that

476
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:36,190
maybe not all of you know how to do and
so they would fall off a cliff where do

477
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:40,970
you go from there and so we started a
program called the academy in computing

478
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:44,220
terms you can think of MIT as a
mainstream you go there and get

479
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:50,120
processed and it works well that there
is a calculation late last year that MIT

480
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,310
is between

481
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:55,860
russia and germany has the world's
economy for the businesses run off so it

482
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:01,780
it it works well but it's only a few
thousand people I don't like online

483
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:06,210
movies online classes in computing terms
it's it's time sharing your terminal

484
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:10,730
connected to the educational processor
what we're doing in this fab academy

485
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:15,100
initially teaching digital fabrication
is it like the internet students have

486
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:20,319
peers in workgroups in labs with
machines and mentor is locally then we

487
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,300
connect them by video and content
sharing so the global class and there's

488
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,840
this profound connection between
communication computation fabrication

489
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,870
and engineering the communication let
the stalking a distance so that

490
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:38,660
computation that says share information
and then the fabrication means once you

491
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,470
have a basic set of tools you can make
anything else so you can bring the

492
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:47,379
campus to the student the whole model of
MIT is based on books are scares people

493
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,830
are scares tools are scarce faces scarce
and say you limited to the few thousand

494
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:56,390
people once you mix communication and
computation with fabrication you can

495
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,690
then do this on a global scale so we've
been doing right now we're running at

496
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:04,540
about a hundred sites in this global
campus a colleague George church is one

497
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,050
of the leading geneticists

498
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,740
the second class in the sequence which
is how to grow almost anything which is

499
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,720
the recursion of the use of Fab Lab to
make a bio lab and then you learn to do

500
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:21,020
biotechnology it's a really the whole
division education industry

501
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:24,350
play or do we all separate them this way
but if anybody can make anything

502
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:28,270
anywhere across all of them and the
hardest thing in all of this I thought

503
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:31,830
was the research I spent the first part
of the talk on that's been innocence

504
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:36,410
easy that's coming along with been hard
is we've had to invent completely new

505
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:41,660
organizations it just breaks what is aid
what is business what is the school and

506
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,930
we had to create a whole new set of
organizations that a little bit like the

507
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:47,430
emergence of the IETF in the iad

508
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:51,009
be in the organizations in the birth of
the internet so if you think of this as

509
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:54,819
an Internet of real things we've had to
invent the kind of organizations for it

510
00:44:54,819 --> 00:44:58,660
and in many ways it's much harder than
the technology it's much harder it's

511
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,890
easy to find people to invent it's much
harder sort of this nesting of people to

512
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:09,190
invent invention in the organization's
so if there is a background in all of

513
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:14,369
these and so that's a tour through very
short-term to medium to long-term what

514
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:17,780
does it mean to finally get over the
16th at digital and physical are

515
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:43,310
different and bring them together so
that all thank you and take questions

516
00:45:43,310 --> 00:46:07,040
problematical relationship with Ray
Kurzweil because he drives me crazy but

517
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:15,240
there's a but he knew me as marching
lock-step to execute his road map and

518
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,709
then he proceeded to show me the graphs
that that that anticipate every single

519
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:25,730
thing I've ever done so I don't

520
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:33,210
with a disclaimer ray I like having said
that he's canceling he does his homework

521
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:39,380
the word singularity has come to be
attached to the sort of millennial

522
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:47,040
that does fuzzy thinking and doesn't do
the homework and so I think the best

523
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,450
answer is this is that digital
revolution like communication and

524
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:56,009
computation but now for fabrication this
one is going to be bigger because

525
00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:01,120
reprogramming the world out here not the
world in there but all of these end up

526
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,900
being signals that they're exponentials
in its employees exponential becomes a

527
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,550
sigmoid Andreas an argument for how you
stack enough sigmoid and it eventually

528
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:13,930
becomes an exponential of exponentials
but I expect this is going to be a

529
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:19,910
sigmoid it is scary I think the most
alarming part of all of this was a

530
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:25,859
dinner I had at my house last week with
the leaders

531
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:34,650
gene drives and as well as critics and
so gene drive is nothing I told you a

532
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:40,490
scary compared to gene drives and Jean
Dr is Chris Burke asinine is this

533
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:47,399
amazing system that Emacs RVI for DNA it
just think the idea that you can just

534
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,190
get in and change anything it's amazing
it works beautifully it's easy to use

535
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:58,210
the alarming thing you can do is if you
wanted to say get rid of malaria you

536
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:01,890
could try to read a better mosquito they
didn't have malaria and hope it would

537
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:07,589
spread or you can put the added to the
genome of the mosquito that doesn't

538
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:12,870
spread malaria and in the genome put the
machine Chris Burke asinine such that

539
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:17,540
you make missus ito's with the machinery
to modify the genome into every every

540
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:21,890
child mosquito has the machinery to
modify the genome and seek an

541
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:26,509
exponential ring up of spreading the
machinery through the genome energy to

542
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:30,410
get you get rid of malaria and if you
get it wrong you kill all mosquitoes on

543
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,379
earth

544
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:42,440
and so that that community of biologists
has stepped back to say wait a minute so

545
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,060
this is all related to germline
modification which is permanent change

546
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:49,700
to a genome and say this is actually
really scary we can do this we don't

547
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:54,319
know how to manage it if you actually
did what I said it's not quite that

548
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:00,820
simple there countervailing forces but
it's roughly like that and so the

549
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,480
biologists are doing everything I told
you and we're part of collaborations one

550
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,790
of our collaborations is designing
completely synthetic lace another

551
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:12,220
collaboration is recording the genome
decree of codons and so we can do all of

552
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:16,730
this and when you make itself
reproducing there it really is alarming

553
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:22,140
it's exciting but alarming as soon as
you go to these non biological systems

554
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:26,120
it no longer can spread exponentially
because it doesn't have the feedstock

555
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,299
that that despite exponentially you need
to sources from the environment the

556
00:49:29,300 --> 00:50:16,030
seeds stuck in the back

557
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:21,660
that's the question is democratizing
access how does it spread arguably the

558
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:26,899
first two revolutions were sort of sales
in the rich get richer and they spread

559
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:34,180
in equality they've done good stuff but
as much bad stuff that to be clear this

560
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:41,410
sad love story ended with is not what I
think what I thought was to set up one

561
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:43,100
lab and then go back to the world

562
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:47,480
back to the lab and this exponential
growth is what the world and so nobody's

563
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,360
planning this is sort of lateral
alignment assets opting in but something

564
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,970
we have been seeing is all over the
world

565
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:01,200
these labs are flourishing under the
noses of places that have terrible

566
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:08,180
racial tension and terrible economic
disenfranchisement and the labs are

567
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,370
being driven in a sense they're relieved
the democratically elite they're being

568
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:16,549
driven by Braden benefit people all over
the world who don't fit you are looking

569
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:25,050
for opportunity and so there's a
wonderful lab network in France I was in

570
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:29,400
a meeting of the elites in France of
like the heads of state and the heads of

571
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:34,880
corporations and it was crazy like I was
speaking in a session of is it possible

572
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,040
to an innovative fans should everybody
leaving good at Silicon Valley and

573
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,580
that's the view from on top but down in
the trenches this whole other generation

574
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:48,190
just giving up on government and sort of
creating this whole network from the

575
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:52,960
bottom up in the same sense what's
happening in barcelona is the Catalan

576
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,960
separatism they basically left Spain and
left Europe because Brussels and Madrid

577
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,130
are helping and they're creating sort of
this new notion of an economy and so

578
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:06,609
it's a real concern based on the last
round

579
00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:12,450
and but what we have been seeing is this
is really being driven by people being

580
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:16,839
stale by the existing economy and
inventing a new one really extreme

581
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:22,089
example one of these labs on the giza
plateau during the mercy riots to call

582
00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:29,349
them worry I'm concerned are you ok and
the kind of laughed and said for the

583
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:32,730
Brighton then of kids who have no
interest in sectarian conflict they took

584
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:36,460
it as a day after go to the lab and work
and they're just fine

585
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:44,999
yeah and so let's go questions but
reproducing the history of PCs all the

586
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:49,109
people who should be worried about this
because they think it's a choice so it's

587
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:57,890
coming in under the radar

588
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:23,420
early period when you needed to know a
lot about a lot of stuff and there is

589
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,300
nothing on offer there is no big benefit
was justice

590
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,980
beautiful thing what's important to know
about that period is most of it was

591
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:38,100
driving it was not trying to make faster
computers it was you could use as

592
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:42,250
interesting you can make computers at a
quantum mechanics are you can exactly

593
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,670
the opposite

594
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:47,380
quantum mechanics is taught in the
language of partial differential

595
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:53,190
equations partial differential equations
are the idea of two centuries ago

596
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:58,130
there's nothing fundamental about them
you could you computation is a much more

597
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:02,410
fundamental description of nature and
the partial differential equations are a

598
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:08,069
Dr property of nature is a computer and
that's really what was driving a lot of

599
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:13,500
the early work on quantum computing and
so now fast-forwarding then went to me a

600
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:19,260
very unhappy period where once things
like shirts came out he became a work

601
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,770
program for physicists wear whatever
anybody was doing what I'm doing quantum

602
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:28,820
computing and we're now at a stage where
much of the claims of quantum computing

603
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:34,110
commercially are ridiculously overblown
and hard it comes down to to really get

604
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:38,660
the power of a quantum computer you need
to be in a maximally entangled state and

605
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:45,680
the record for that still is around ten
cubits but so far the killer app for

606
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:52,040
quantum computing is simulating other
quantum systems it's exponentially hard

607
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,820
to simulate my mechanics and beautiful
work is being done to make universal

608
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:01,530
quantum simulators let you model atomic
physics or transistors scaling so using

609
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:04,590
quantum computing to model quantum
systems is a beautiful

610
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:09,150
nation there's a really beautiful thing
emerging of really revisiting the

611
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:14,130
foundations of how we describe quantum
mechanics but technologically I just

612
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:17,960
don't see it is very important in our
lifetime because maintaining maximally

613
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,850
entangled states significantly larger is
exponentially did difficult they just

614
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:50,670
don't see any quick opportunities there

615
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:57,950
yes the question is how do we get from
can we do it too should we do it which

616
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:10,500
is an important question is always gets
more alarming yeah the so I do believe

617
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:16,850
in history and fruit for essentially all
of history we've been on the verge of

618
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:23,110
new things that are the end of life on
Earth and that's been consistent and

619
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:28,330
inconsistent throughout history is you
sir technology by itself isn't good or

620
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:35,670
bad people are good or bad so a
microcosm of your question is i three

621
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:42,080
rooms of intelligence analyst army
generals about all of this research and

622
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:46,040
when they get to the part at the end
about nine year old African girls in

623
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:51,190
rural villages doing surface mount
freeware consistently the room fractures

624
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:59,800
down the middle and so at room 11 army
generals half the room said my god we

625
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:06,330
have to control this but the other half
of the room that is not that they is

626
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:10,529
very finely divided their many days and
the other half the rooms are you kidding

627
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:15,440
the best thing they can possibly do is
have girls doing service that's at the

628
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,820
root of just about everything you are a
roomful of intelligence analysts and the

629
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:26,410
same thing and there was one guy his
face was red he was fuming I'm on the

630
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:30,200
hook to present prevent unanticipated
threats to our country and you're

631
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,450
telling me about the girls making
servicemen electronics in rural Africa

632
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,589
and the other part in the room the
intelligence analyst turned to that

633
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:39,650
Lennon said are you kidding if ever
there was something we should be paying

634
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:43,310
attention to its exactly that and so we
had

635
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:48,730
at the Protestant Catholic boundary in
northern ireland we have them here let

636
00:57:48,730 --> 00:58:13,490
me show you a picture

637
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,200
this one is that the israeli-palestinian
boundary in israel we have one at the

638
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,200
Protestant Catholic county in northern
ireland you know we have one in

639
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:28,779
Afghanistan and what we find is that
these are used for bad thing because

640
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:36,070
doing bad things to say well met market
needs you wanna hurt somebody that

641
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:45,630
there's great supply chains need to get
used to doing bad stuff and so it it

642
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:49,380
sort of nobody's in charge at the
lateral alignment bottom-up answer but

643
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,960
it's kind of investing in the wisdom of
ordinary people and I think that's both

644
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,830
kind of a trivial but a profound answer
that by democratizing access sort of

645
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:03,520
state actors are you can do all of this
stuff by democratizing access you know

646
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,710
it sort of brings in

647
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:42,619
inside of communities and I think that's
a really important part of it

648
00:59:42,619 --> 01:00:05,280
yeah

649
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:14,110
gathering of heads of state ever and
this was a couple months ago this is

650
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:21,100
sustainable development goals and the
Millennium Development Goals roughly

651
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:25,520
where rich white guys telling the world
what it should do that this was kind of

652
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,480
a duel of the world figure out what it
wants to do but the reason I was there

653
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,670
was the lighthouse was involved to try
to present not just problems but

654
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:39,970
solutions and so the Millennium
Development Goals are things like clean

655
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:45,480
water access to health care and a
surprising fraction of them rest on

656
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:50,450
access to digital fabrication so one of
the things we set up a pop of lab at the

657
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:55,850
UN and it was a great kids from Peru who
one of the Fab Lab leaders there he grew

658
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:58,880
up in the Amazon jungle and as he
describes it when the group had three

659
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,080
choices you could be a farmer a soldier
terrorists had to pick one of those and

660
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,029
so he's sending rapid prototyping tools
up the Amazon for sustainable production

661
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:11,950
in indigenous communities and if you go
across this checklist was with the

662
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:18,029
person in charge of humanitarian relief
for the UN better and I was speaking at

663
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:20,980
a dinner and she's really irritated cuz
he wanted to deal with the problems of

664
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:25,320
refugees was talking about machines she
wanted to deal with refugees don't have

665
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:29,510
access to infrastructure they don't have
access to education they don't have

666
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:32,170
access to entertainment and then the
speed of light bulb went off lead a

667
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:36,560
minute if you actually provide access to
these tools it it gets it all of that

668
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:42,340
and so there is this happening it when
he ran a lap at the UN which is a wild

669
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:47,560
experience bringing high power lasers
through security

670
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:53,060
the diplomats were reacting like wow we
don't see what people like you here and

671
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:57,759
so your question is is a good one
nothing's really written yet about this

672
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:05,420
it's evolving but if you think about
notions like work money refugee school

673
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:11,260
and think about connecting breaking the
bed an amount jury it really changes all

674
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,880
of that and it really means

675
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,940
there's a sort of medi- project of
reinventing how we live learn work and

676
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,950
play and so that's not just writing it's
really on the ground and ending with a

677
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:23,769
troll the lake and I think that's a good
point to end on that I'll be happy to

678
01:02:23,769 --> 01:02:33,859
talk informally an invite you for all of
us thank you

679
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:40,160
personally I was really engaging and a
little bit different than what we

680
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,490
normally see but the feedback that we're
seeing just an online has been fantastic

681
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:47,509
so it was really great one of our
traditions for our keynote speaker
