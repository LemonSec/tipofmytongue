1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,590
it easier for us to handle the masses of
data that we keep acquiring some very

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,680
much looking forward to this and just
John and Rob who told me to tell you

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,049
they're both nuts and that they've been
working on this for over five years so

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:26,130
we're lucky to have the result of your
Scott please look at the speakers by

5
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,109
yourself first

6
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:36,950
yeah so in in systems engineering field
for since 1988 two years older than that

7
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,070
his birthday

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:45,129
ok for you got for you guys so we're
holding up pretty well for all guys know

9
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:52,539
so I got a new fuel to rape old age of
18 kind of figured out what I want to do

10
00:00:52,539 --> 00:01:00,260
very young and aged local handed me an
old apple computer and said hey can do

11
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,960
anything you want with this I said what
do you mean he said there is like a box

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,570
of Legos if you can build with Legos you
can build any kind of software that you

13
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,669
want I took that to heart

14
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,470
fast forward you know where I'm at now

15
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:21,750
exciting opportunity to do some really
cool stuff really cool employer and met

16
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,210
John about five years ago and we've been
doing some crazy things ever since you

17
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,500
know so I want

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,420
trained as an economist I really like
solving puzzles and crunching numbers

19
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,860
and so what I've actually realized in
the last couple years is that that means

20
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,610
I'm called the data scientist but I he
said John what is it a scientist data

21
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,870
scientist is

22
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:53,880
cool term for that decision so I like
playing with numbers it's really fun

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,060
because you go to parties and you tell
people you do math in the first they say

24
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,960
is I hated math in high school may walk
away it's actually really awesome if you

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,899
don't wanna talk to somebody down is the
ultimate wingman ever so yes and we have

26
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,910
a lot of fun because Rob knows how all
the networking stuff works and then I'd

27
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:19,280
say okay with numbers so we are the two
great tastes that go great together and

28
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,300
it's Rob mentioned you know about five
years ago and the story robert l is the

29
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:33,300
first time at John I said to john is a
Java talk to you about the data sets

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,350
were going to be using is like no I
don't know anything about it and liked

31
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,480
what he means first guy I've ever met
first data scientists first usually

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,290
database administrator describe how your
day to me what are you talking about you

33
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,989
know what is this data how do you
organize it john was a person I've ever

34
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,340
met that said don't tell me anything
about your data at all I'll figure it

35
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,959
out I was like cool what your background
music medical so first thing I sent a

36
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,370
data center and John he runs a threesome
analytics he comes back to me says he

37
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,340
robbed all these source ports are
different and they're talking to the

38
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,010
same destination port in this dataset
that you sent me and they're talking to

39
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:20,840
this port number et what does that mean
they're talking you know what traffic is

40
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,130
like but wire reports all different
things called RFC he's talked about the

41
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,350
r/c comment that we talked about the
other day the Internet is a draft yet so

42
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:35,540
John says to me is like where's the
specification on these particles I said

43
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,429
what do you mean as a DRC he's like no
no no

44
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,380
after the URC there's a thing called a
standard and I said we don't have those

45
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,980
right and this is actually why I like
the problem for a map and analytics and

46
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,018
stats i'd because usually when you're
doing stats problems for math problems

47
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:54,430
you very clearly defined

48
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,200
thing you very clearly defined structure
you very clearly defined outcome right

49
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,379
and you do you work you do you prove you
collect your data and it all sort of

50
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,548
just come together and you publish a
really boring paper that nobody ever

51
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:10,349
reads and instead here we are and robs
like yeah we don't have any outcomes ok

52
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:15,909
that's kind of interesting problem how
do we find the unknown on and that's

53
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:19,478
kind of the theme of the talk is what we
can work out for five years is munching

54
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:23,620
on data and taking network traffic and
finding ways to describe it to try and

55
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,280
identify patterns revenge without
actually knowing what we're looking for

56
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:37,090
click to the next yeah I think about us
exactly so why do we keep trying to find

57
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:45,198
problem so this is really important so
johnnie I like to feel like we do pretty

58
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,440
much everything to the point of failure
and come back a little rabbit holes and

59
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,599
figure out like you know what the heck
do wrong what we do different approaches

60
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:59,229
that we tried but it's fun to fail just
remember that and actually feelings

61
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:05,669
important that you learn so a little bit
of the back on after we came from so if

62
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:07,530
you were here in 2014

63
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:13,599
Robin I had built a game where you could
visualize network traffic and we did

64
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:18,289
that in partnership with our employers
at the time we demoed that it was very

65
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:23,580
cool it didn't really scale very well
and we were kind of struggling again

66
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,430
with how to put useful information into
that visualization to help you make

67
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:34,400
better decisions and prior to that you
know the way we actually mad was a

68
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,289
client who want us to apply machine
learning to network traffic and so

69
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:43,620
actually my background for a long time
was started machine learning company

70
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,490
machine learning is the colloquial term
for today I but basically building

71
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,710
software that allows computers to learn
from data from their environment and

72
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,830
when we applied machine learning

73
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,250
to network traffic what we learned was
you know there are tools that make

74
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,220
development really difficult it didn't
scale very well right that's actually

75
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,410
one of the things that most machine
learning software doesn't scale very

76
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,390
well and the result we came out with
wasn't really intuitive to someone who

77
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:17,719
didn't have a stats background right so
we produced up and it worked but people

78
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,410
didn't really know what the heck it said
was the customer said to us all by the

79
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,120
way we're not parking the data so you're
gonna have to operate on this data entry

80
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,510
as it launched in streams and oh by the
way

81
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:38,539
think of the largest data flows you can
think of and multiplied by 10 so not

82
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:45,300
only do we have to figure out how we're
going to do this in real for real but

83
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,600
then also figure out how to make it
massively scalable and the tools at the

84
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:58,170
time we're talking five years ago no
joke you either had to pay three-letter

85
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:04,990
company that doesn't do windows whole
lot of money for a whole lotta licenses

86
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,750
for three things or you had you know
gold real kind of you know cutting-edge

87
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:15,270
pasta with some stuff that was not
material includes job a desktop software

88
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,500
which really doesn't work well and so
the other thing that Robin mentioned in

89
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,990
this will come back to this in a few
slide you know if you're going to use

90
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,680
machine learning or statistical software
right that's not usually requires you to

91
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,530
assemble a lot of data to train the
algorithm and so we've been trying to

92
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,869
get away from you can never get away
from training but we're trying to

93
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:44,090
minimize the trading when you're dealing
data but

94
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:52,469
large volumes of data but when you have
a system that changes a lot right

95
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:59,389
building a training set is very very
difficult so feeling like a boss stuck a

96
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:05,970
little things here in the white whiskey
ontology John I like to draw wipers a

97
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,270
lot and the only way we can capture any
thoughts that we have caused his own

98
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:17,229
race is really fast is kind of phone
capture the way boards and you know my

99
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:22,159
bottom line is if you gonna fail fail
hard when you feel hard that's that's a

100
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,729
great stopping point don't go any
further than that failure don't try to

101
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:32,880
figure out my gosh I feel sorry you know
just fail fail heart stopped and then

102
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,110
know that that's an Aimpoint you don't
ever need to go to again barring like

103
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,839
large changes in technology or something
coming up that you just don't know about

104
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,839
right now

105
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,630
yes I think you're starting out with
this like reply machine learning

106
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,720
algorithms to large industrial network
data you know what are some lessons we

107
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,140
took away as we continue to play with
this idea and the first one is keep it

108
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,830
simple right and don't over engineered
solution you can fall in love with the

109
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,950
beauty of the math and the analytics and
the algorithms I've done it what you'll

110
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,029
find out if you actually do this is that
the more sophisticated and beautiful

111
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:17,200
your analytic the more headaches you
have and it doesn't actually necessarily

112
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,770
give you a better result now to put that
in stream ok so now put that beautiful

113
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:31,819
analytic that John spent all this time
on looking at set to data stream and

114
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,790
wonder why bricks machines

115
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:42,180
yes right and the other thing is you can
get dumber if you try right and a quote

116
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,010
that actually love

117
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,950
is Antoine de saint-exupery who wrote
the little prince and paraphrases

118
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,780
wrongly basie says perfection is when
there's nothing left to take away not

119
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,550
when there's nothing left to add show
focused on how do we kind of parents

120
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:00,870
away don't get off the last ball point
there's something really important were

121
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,170
looking for help rate you know one of
the things that we're trying to get to

122
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:10,689
you is not the Robin John show feeling
chipper five years the same way

123
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,830
different ways whatever comes up here
every couple of years when we get

124
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:19,340
accepted shook on it and showing you
another dog visualization we need help

125
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,520
so we're gonna talk about that a little
bit later about how we're going to

126
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:31,420
solicit your help but like you got some
crazy great ideas to try no computers up

127
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,390
later ok we'll give you should contact
the police but I wanted to ask you some

128
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:41,189
questions so we brought down even more

129
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,240
make it easier for people to understand
the basic the four key pieces right so

130
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,300
sensing data so we'll talk about sensing
and sensors ingesting the data so once

131
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,370
he sends the data you have to collect it
somewhere you have to do some basic

132
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,620
preparation to do operations on it

133
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,670
enriching the data to this is where sort
of the analytics peace comes in but

134
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,060
we're trying to keep it really really
simple and then visualizing the data so

135
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,839
how do you provide scalable
visualisations that anybody can look at

136
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,630
and at least get something out of even
if they don't know the specifics of the

137
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:20,840
network engineering back so how far do
we make it that far enough right now we

138
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:28,000
are using force sensors very old kind of

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,080
library has been out there so-called
soft Lodi kind of wrapped into a bunch

140
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:42,190
of different open-source routers like
pfSense open sends been around for a

141
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:48,750
long time so we took in the forecast
that putting on some hardware so we're

142
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:55,610
able to actually run and generate
NetFlow clothes that were pulled some

143
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,650
interesting data we try to stay away
from Keith P cap cos when we get down to

144
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:07,439
the pcap level we felt we feel really
fast really hard it's just not something

145
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,930
that we can do

146
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:15,550
reliably there are some hardware options
out there that are coming out that we

147
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:21,469
might be able to do some scaling problem
gets worse and the other problem is from

148
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:26,650
an analytic perspective when you get to
the pcap level even though every sin

149
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:31,300
taxes consistent the structure of the
data is not right and analytics needs

150
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,990
structured data in some way

151
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:39,260
keeps telling me that all the time so we
decided to go with every aggregate flows

152
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,640
it will be five levels since that was
kind of like the easiest way to do that

153
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:51,220
works then see johnnie talked about it
for a long time and we're talking about

154
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,860
Treasury's we're not talking about like
spark we're not talking to stuff you

155
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,370
know where my car badges or parking data

156
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:03,830
running jobs were lost her you're
pulling data off the cluster and

157
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:07,510
analyzing it including analytic results
and then and then pumping out into

158
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:12,339
visualization talking about actually did
off the wire running it through

159
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:15,600
analytics and improving the
visualization without parking you did it

160
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:26,890
all we do a lot of pretty much
everything that we're doing is data Jul

161
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:39,860
kids and sci-fi are all the vendors as
an analytic smile when I will say is my

162
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,390
considered view that before you build
any analytic any algorithm need to go

163
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:50,150
hit some of the public libraries because
there are so many analytics out there I

164
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:56,709
just cannot imagine that if you need to
build your own special customize your

165
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:02,140
data you either have a really weird
problem are you having done so many

166
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:12,730
libraries out there for this stuff so
visualization we started off with like

167
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,160
forced to recognize ass and I don't know
if any of you guys Rashmi con 45 years

168
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:25,390
ago I did a big twittershare ball with a
really smart guy who was who invented

169
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:30,110
support directed graph and 3d
visualization JavaScript guys ahead of

170
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:39,390
Canada hockey pucks jump into it we
played around a bunch of punching game

171
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:45,720
engines couple guys came through a
couple years ago and told us that game

172
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,160
engine sucked

173
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:58,420
I don't seem in the audience so we're
really good game ages I could actually

174
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,410
scale looked at the Unreal Engine and
that's kind of where we're kind of stuck

175
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:09,480
right now looking at what can we do to
keep these visualizations faster

176
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:21,519
computer vision peace division aspects
we realized that we needed another layer

177
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:30,740
of taking our analytic results and
analyzing them ahead of time and one of

178
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:36,769
the things that I love is as a hobby is
robotics and I've been playing around

179
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,439
with robot operating system for a long
time and one of the aspects in their GOP

180
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:46,730
computer vision project she has a lot of
really cool algorithms in it allows you

181
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:55,110
to analyze frames of information and has
anybody seen a video where the guy super

182
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:01,389
mario brothers to play itself ok good so
he was taking place is a memory right

183
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:06,769
and what he was doing is analyzing each
frame and data for free marker and take

184
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:12,910
a look at each frame its aim is my score
going up as my school going down from

185
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:19,750
this data so I thought to myself as a
shit if I took our analytics compress

186
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:25,819
them down into something that the
computer can recognize as flame and

187
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:30,540
analyzed previous raids in and take
lessons from that going forward

188
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,219
information can I clean so I'm not near
the bottom here but I got the data that

189
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:43,000
can go into that kind that's right to
raise problems crazy people this is

190
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,790
where I talk about math and they decide
to stop and so mention one of the

191
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,259
challenge

192
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:53,339
that we've had right which actually is
products fine is that understanding

193
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:58,739
network traffic is very very hard
problem from a perspective and analytics

194
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:02,929
perspective the statistics perspective
what you have is a highly polymorphic

195
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:06,879
system that subject to emergent behavior

196
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,449
everybody here know what the word
polymorphic means cause if not I'll

197
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:16,899
provide a quick definition it changes a
lot in very unpredictable ways right so

198
00:17:16,898 --> 00:17:21,418
the Internet is actually almost like a
living organism in it mutates it changes

199
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:25,579
it has its own behavior right and
actually if you want some really cool

200
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,740
reading just googled her emergent
behavior and go read about it right this

201
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,230
is one of the debate around self-driving
cars right because the cars rock on this

202
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,690
and they started behaving collective
ways that we as people can anticipate

203
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,940
what's interesting is that this is part
of the reason we have financial crises

204
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:47,330
right everything's going great and the
stock market dropped 2,000 points in all

205
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,269
these people sitting around having lost
tens of billions of dollars and

206
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,840
scratching their heads being like I
didn't see that coming

207
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,789
well right cuz it's a highly polymorphic
system with emergent behavior and things

208
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:02,129
start to happen and the challenges that
if you think about classical statistics

209
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:05,969
and analytics right I have a defined
outcome I have a defined starting point

210
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:13,039
very defined system ok sports analytics
and sports statistics are really awesome

211
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,658
and fun to play with and they're great
for teaching cause they're really

212
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:21,690
consistent it is really really really
unlikely to probably 20 but it's really

213
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,169
small the next year someone is going to
hit 95,000 home runs right i mean it

214
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:29,320
could happen but it's really unlikely

215
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,299
on the other hand in things like
financial markets the internet you know

216
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:37,700
certain different types of systems of
which networking into markets are the

217
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,320
two really good examples ya tomorrow
someone shows up in its 95,000 home runs

218
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,049
you have no idea what has happened

219
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:52,549
so it's a really challenging problem and
if you really want to get into it

220
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:56,960
this goes back to the beginning of the
project we're trying to solve this using

221
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,330
Bayesian networks I don't know what
amazing network is raise your hand ok so

222
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,939
some of you so they don't work

223
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:13,710
conditional their graphs of conditional
probabilities so if I know these two

224
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,450
things here is the likelihood of
something else happening right so if I

225
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:23,340
have a network with reno's the state of
notte his condition then what I know

226
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,230
about news B&C right which sounds simple
enough in its own right but then you

227
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,989
realize that nodes B&C have all these
different potential states they could be

228
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:37,879
so all we're doing is trying to model
port pairing right I have 65,000 squared

229
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:44,709
states that any pair of nodes and the
study of no day is conditioned on those

230
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,409
65,000 square states of nodes B&C in
very quickly this becomes what's called

231
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:54,600
an np-hard problem right this is not a
problem you can simply compute and so

232
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,359
people usually go out this problem with
your mystics it works great if you have

233
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,309
something that is reasonably stable like
genetic data because you know there are

234
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:07,379
genetic mutations but they don't happen

235
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:12,209
super fast right again evolution moves
along but it doesn't move that fast

236
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,289
the problem is the evil lucien in
networking data is crazy it happens and

237
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:24,619
lightning fast so we said ok how do we
tried to get out this and we we realize

238
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:29,899
that the challenge is not how do I make
a computer function like a human we've

239
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:34,869
been trying to do for a long time we
have much better autonomous systems but

240
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:38,908
it's someone who's an old machine
learning guy I actually have come to the

241
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:43,159
conclusion that trying to to create
strong AI trying to make a computer here

242
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:49,519
but human is not a very productive
exercise in fact what what we want to

243
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,970
try and do is make the computer dahmer
to make the human smarter right so how

244
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,940
can we actually use the analog

245
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,260
visualisations to try and push lots of
data at a person in a way that a person

246
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,030
can understand you know if you think
about it evolution has has engineered us

247
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:11,240
to be able to detect things really
really fast that's why we don't get

248
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,110
eaten by Tigers I mean I'm sure some
people will probably see them in the zoo

249
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,229
in this room

250
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,080
who've actually like being in the jungle
and bumped into a tiger but you know

251
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,540
enough to know that if you see one you
probably the other way

252
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:34,490
a computer to do that takes a shit load
of data so the question is how can I use

253
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,580
the computer to provide the data to you
in a way that makes sense and let your

254
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,230
brain doin it does really well which is
sparse pattern recognition so this is

255
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,340
actually picture of arriving in in my
house right and the point I think about

256
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,689
the rug is you can look at this writing
you can see the pattern that totally

257
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,820
makes sense if I showed you the lunar
the weaver working with all the threads

258
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,780
would make no sense to you so how do i
turn the threads into a pattern you can

259
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:09,260
get this other slide which I know rob is
sick so yes so what do those things have

260
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,250
in common a window

261
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:20,510
how do you know that fantastic you're
smarter the computer is already look at

262
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:25,290
the bottom row there what do we see if
you look at the very end you'll see a

263
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:30,840
school bus and capture right you guys
know that but what the actual computer

264
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,020
seized is you know a bunch of nonsense
that it can't recognize allows you to

265
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,030
really extensive training it's only good
like two percent of the time

266
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:46,240
ok that's a reason why catches capture
you can define and build up a really

267
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,830
good you know catch a braking system
then probably need some phone calls from

268
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:56,428
people who have money whatever point is
is that

269
00:22:56,429 --> 00:23:02,470
you can tell a kid hey this is an eagle
this is a bird this is a swan this is a

270
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,860
bird even though they don't know that
that third one with the third one is at

271
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:12,199
Cardinal Hill look at that and say
that's a bird that's actually kind of

272
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,720
interesting because all you had to do is
provide training said to human that was

273
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,320
two instances deep and they kinda
getting grass but that is OK channel

274
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,590
tell you about all the point of actors
and all kinds of other math stuff

275
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,860
they're not going to training computer
do the same thing and we can do that

276
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:35,699
pretty pretty quickly so that's kind of
where we can actually out peace

277
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:43,360
a computer with pattern recognition he
got it so the answer is keep it simple

278
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,769
stupid right now we're boiling down and
used simple data analytics and learn

279
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:53,580
from smart people and easier to really
awesome talks so we also have a bunch of

280
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,519
different things that we've looked at in
seeing that kind of inspired or working

281
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:04,909
in one of these so yeah

282
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:12,480
shaken people talking so I don't know
how it happened but you had to say about

283
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,610
i think is like 10 cyber defense you
know don't throw a ball at me for saying

284
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:23,320
it's his title his talk but basically
what it was was he was taking he was

285
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,320
taking an OS and represent the 10
three-dimensional cue and then looking

286
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,939
to help malware was applied that and
slicing slicing and dicing and all

287
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,820
different kinds ways

288
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,869
check that talk out as I was really
inspirational and gave John and I a

289
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:39,299
whole bunch of new inspiration

290
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:48,029
Jeff Jonas he tortured his family I
don't know if you know who is the

291
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:53,239
context analytics stuff right that's
what he did was that they took 44

292
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:59,399
puzzles and mix them all together and
took pieces out giving said put the

293
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:09,168
puzzle together and then what happened
when and eventually figured out that

294
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:17,220
Jack was evil evil Red Bull pieces of
the puzzle him exposes together and they

295
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,590
could kids couldn't figure out where to
go what to do but they had the context

296
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,480
they had enough of the puzzle to figure
out what the thing actually was so

297
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:32,899
that's kind of true john on your next
step and actually thought it was a bit

298
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:39,658
here and there were many chances here
Jeff Jonas speak ok if you ever do do it

299
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:44,559
i mean in my view it's the closest thing
I've ever had to a religious experience

300
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:50,080
trillion he's developing busted the MIT
Blackjack team and a lot of his work

301
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,759
with the matching the pieces is around
some work he's doing on space-time

302
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,789
boxing where he basically throughout
this idea that hey we don't actually

303
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,840
have to fit everything together
perfectly

304
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,499
you just have to get it close enough and
so he's actually one of the things he's

305
00:26:03,499 --> 00:26:07,970
doing is really cool he's helping nasa
with the asteroid problem right the

306
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,919
asteroid problem being that at some
point if a large asteroid extinct so we

307
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:18,100
better figure out of its gonna happen to
take some action happening next week so

308
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,238
so actually day nasa couldn't make any
headway as I like what we have to

309
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:25,529
compute all these trajectories all the
same time and there is one of compute

310
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:29,919
power and Jeff's like no you just have
to know if to ask because independent

311
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,739
computer trajectories and they're like
oh yeah we had thought of that so so

312
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:37,530
where are we now

313
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:45,629
like so she gets lost and she sees his
man down on the ground and she says you

314
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,340
know where I am he says yes you're up in
the balloon she said you must be a

315
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,620
senior manager says I am how do you know
that because you just told me something

316
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:58,120
is totally correct an absolutely useless
so we're trying get away from doing

317
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,600
stuff that's totally correct and
absolutely useless and getting more

318
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,370
stuff it's like 98% correct and more
useful or just wrong so we can learn

319
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:06,870
from it

320
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:13,870
right okay where's the cheese so they
may recognize this image

321
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:21,489
fans out there anybody know what that
what that information in a graphic how's

322
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:29,460
that plot works now my co-workers so
unless you really take a look at this

323
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,980
and really understand how this plot
worked which will notice is it it's the

324
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,290
actual top-level do me a lot

325
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:42,030
ok of the entire Internet range way it
plotted is on a space-filling curve

326
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:50,360
simply a worker died actually looks like
that underneath ok so what's pretty cool

327
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:59,399
about this plot it's information that is
in in one D ok in one dimension allows

328
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,700
you plug it into two dimensions and
keeping the closeness of the values of

329
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,620
the data so the majority of the time
that we're dealing with information and

330
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,929
when we're doing an analytic the
analytic results sometimes comes out in

331
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:18,470
a single value and what we want to do is
when applied it and if we're looking at

332
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,240
a network for example looking at

333
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:31,350
well as level the network 24 I got two
hundred and fifty six that I can

334
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:35,209
actually plot I can take that
information uploaded on this graph

335
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,200
pretty interesting leonel show the
closeness now why is that important

336
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,290
well I don't know that you some network
administrators I know like to have a

337
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:52,090
DHCP range like to have a static
arranged to have a range of addresses

338
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:57,090
that they put certain piece of equipment
in ok well that person is thinking in

339
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:03,209
their brain together to put these things
together I want to put this together

340
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,680
ok you plot the data on space filling
curve you'll actually see that

341
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:16,100
information into centers of information
later ok now here could write a function

342
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:26,689
that would produce that grass without
Google rights oh ok so I did and if you

343
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:31,900
look at my accept Section down there a
lot of painting conservation get right

344
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:41,700
absolutely nothing about math and I had
to take some code that somebody else

345
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,470
world converted into Python so that can
actually run some tests and see if it

346
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:51,900
actually works great I love the rotation
function but all this code is going to

347
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,330
be able to get up later anyways have it
but it was kind of interesting because

348
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,399
you know I never really played around
with this kind of stuff and plotting and

349
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,520
taking a single value plotting an XY so
it's kind of interesting play with it

350
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:11,450
right now where we are as far as the

351
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:18,310
how we do what we do and sensing

352
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:28,360
generating NetFlow traffic streaming
platform called Stream parts which was

353
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:35,050
on top of storm part but basically what
it did was took and actually allowed you

354
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:47,570
do different languages the storm I don't
know anybody here Java fanned 11 Java

355
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:55,100
fan Josh yeah I know but she's just like
Java with Apache storming here

356
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,750
patty storm soaked a snowstorm that very
cool streaming data environment right it

357
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,490
was done by the same guys who built
Twitter facing the backplane for Twitter

358
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,950
syndication so it's a very powerful
immediate environment that is Rob

359
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:11,660
mentioned that the challenges it's all
Java native and so there are only decent

360
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,020
job of it then you get back to the
problem we have with the machine

361
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,190
learning stuff which is when you're
doing lots of machine learning and

362
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:22,360
training and analytics the job very well
well the problem that we have is guys

363
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:28,610
like john has been working in our place
and they had it through the coder

364
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:34,679
defense and they say here on this is the
code that was ok and I gotta go from or

365
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:44,470
Python and Java this so luckily I got
any major mortality partially created a

366
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,870
thing called stream part even though
storm was supposed to be multilanguage

367
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:55,310
it wasn't a little box to injure me to
happen by taking the closure rapper and

368
00:31:55,310 --> 00:32:02,210
BC allowed in sports and pulls you want
just by providing the topology viewed

369
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,020
closer I get a lot of boring stuff

370
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:19,300
and any free open-source out there Jess
enrich the data and then the

371
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,840
visualization what we're trying to do is
we're trying to compress down the

372
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,419
analytic results into really small
things we can get about a thousand 24

373
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:35,970
analytic results of 16 by 16 pixel image
that seems crazy but that actually

374
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:46,430
covers your entire network so we're
taking we're taking a single pixel and

375
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:53,420
GBA channel ok so four channels of color
I can take for analytics that that kind

376
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:57,990
of John the size or interesting to put
together take that color eyes of pixel

377
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:04,070
plot on health worker in in 16 by 16
pixels get you 2024 analytic results on

378
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,179
your network

379
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:12,320
24 which is a perfect segue to how we're
getting those channel values so first of

380
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,659
all PSA

381
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,270
donating $1 to the prevention of
statistical abuse as we view statistics

382
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:23,850
a lot yes we're basically grabbing stats
functions and using them for things they

383
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,939
weren't designed for so the way we're
getting the channels right now to make

384
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:33,620
it really easy and simple and reuse
stuff is the sci-fi library has lots of

385
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,580
math and stats function so it's really
awesome and Robin I was talking on the

386
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:42,270
phone just before the holiday in early
December and we're talking about how to

387
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:47,139
describe this data right and again the
problem is no outcome right no outcome

388
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,340
in because streaming it's floating so I
don't have

389
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,980
have my usual you know here's a year's
worth of data trainer analytic on I said

390
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:01,600
so I need to be able to boil down
changes in state of this node to a

391
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,070
simple number with maybe a handful of
observations right and i think is very

392
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:10,699
quickly over and over again so we're
running the sample so in extreme you

393
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:15,368
have a window to operate in OKC of
sliding window to constantly moves and

394
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:19,929
information that you maintain your heart
problems right with running on Lake

395
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:25,520
Street its my window what makes sense
how do I party analytics will have to

396
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,500
hold what can I throw away what he tells
off and you gotta think about it in just

397
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,020
a moving environment right so it's
actually like you watching traffic

398
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,440
patterns before you cross the street or
make a right turn left turn in traffic

399
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,710
you really gotta have a sense your
surroundings and only house what

400
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,899
information you need at that point in
time to make a decision right themselves

401
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:49,980
as we all do it every day when you're
crossing the street you're not really

402
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,980
thinking about what's going on the
french government housing he got exactly

403
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,990
what you need for the time period you
need exactly and so sitting in my car in

404
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:04,879
traffic I was thinking about this and I
realized all we need to do is described

405
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,260
the shape of the distribution right so I
think back if you guys have announced as

406
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,890
recently think back your college that
class right you do that little histogram

407
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,930
plot where you can count you know how
many baseball players I have an and you

408
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,859
plotted out and I thought I said all we
have to be able to do is reduce the

409
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:26,810
shape of that distribution to a number
and the beauty of this is that there are

410
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,410
lots of stats functions for doing that
the one we picture skewness and kurtosis

411
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:37,160
skewness basically says which way does
my distribution lean and kurtosis tells

412
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,680
me how spiked it is right so high
kurtosis fiber distribution of

413
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,690
destination ports with a hiker toes is
it basically is pointing to like one or

414
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,260
two ports value 5000 IU

415
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,630
asymptotic 0 it's telling me that I'm
talking to everybody now the reason I

416
00:35:54,630 --> 00:36:03,600
put in the prevention typical of you
slide is that judges can color who are

417
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,759
statisticians you're gonna raise your
hand if you like that's not what these

418
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,890
things were designed for yes you are
correct that is not what they were

419
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:17,810
designed for the Vikings were designed
to compare populations so you could test

420
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:21,680
the difference and we're gonna get there
eventually but for now we're basically

421
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,399
hacking them because it can reduce a
distribution to a number in order to do

422
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,460
that Alpha RGB channels we need a
normalized number between 0 and you

423
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:37,340
apologizing had time and that's why the
rocket like you weren't meant to put

424
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:44,060
rockets would oppose jet on a bike but
you have too much fun

425
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:59,370
alright okay five clinton's so you see a
video and I'm going to describe it

426
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:06,299
yes it is done it but it makes sense to
me and I suck at math we were working on

427
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,250
this and we're like oh wait a minute
that's forum we have 55 quadrants it was

428
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:22,100
worse before right up here and image up
here in the middle and 200 K five images

429
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:27,870
that are plotted in Hilbert
space-filling curve each pixel that you

430
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:36,830
see on there representing for analytic
results are you be john has really

431
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:43,500
really highly technical we were going to
hand this out to let you decipher what

432
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,790
you know what I said you're John this is
ten o'clock on Sunday after Saturday

433
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:54,070
party tell you what why don't we just
ask them to watch the video and remember

434
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,110
which one they thought was interesting

435
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,790
when the video asked the audience to
raise your hand which one they thought

436
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:04,550
was interesting and then we'll tell them
what it was I do have a friend who's

437
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:11,770
gonna make this into a quilt so what I'd
like to do just tell me which area draws

438
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:17,060
your eye what is interesting to you and
then we'll tell you why and then this

439
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,799
population of people are some really
interesting things and again this is

440
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:32,330
what we're trying to do is get the info
interesting information from people I am

441
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:46,060
gonna turn the music up because it's
cool

442
00:38:46,060 --> 00:39:00,230
traffic looks really boring but things
are changing their supplies in there

443
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:05,490
they're interesting each plot has a
different set of analytics at all

444
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,470
different story

445
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:12,950
talk about their things there yet
questions that interesting to you see

446
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,540
that for later if it's not changing its
because the distribution the shape of

447
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:24,420
the distribution isn't changing more
interesting questions so as you can see

448
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,260
we see some some interesting things
happening on the plotters in different

449
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:36,760
colors there the sample was taken over
two minutes and live network traffic we

450
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,010
recorded it just please the demagogues
but

451
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:44,960
in reality what would happen is this
output with then stream into a computer

452
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,810
vision system allows to create tips for
information on what we need to look at

453
00:39:50,810 --> 00:40:00,049
these types of intellectual running in
the quarter's darker later represent ok

454
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:17,250
tell you what I'm gonna let John get
through us talk to you so the answer is

455
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:26,370
it depends on the plot so named the plot
upper left-hand plot is data spewing so

456
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:32,870
basically we have four channels the
alpha channel for all of these is the

457
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:38,109
amount of outbound traffic so how active
the notice outbound so the opacity the

458
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:45,240
color right is is outbound traffic the
the blue channel is high inbound traffic

459
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:51,279
right silly stuff tends towards a blue
or a darker color it's an inbound it has

460
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,010
a lot of inbound traffic it's consuming
a lot of traffic so for example some of

461
00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:00,210
these nodes that are sort of gray right
to become black some of the ones that

462
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:06,190
look purple these are these are notes
that are consuming a lot of traffic so

463
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:10,200
those are consistent on the plot but
upper left hand corner is dated spewing

464
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:18,370
which basically compares the shore sport
and destination port by spreads show how

465
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:25,240
much data and Mike sending from how many
ports and how much my spreading that

466
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,839
data amongst other machines right that's
why I called the latest viewing because

467
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,800
if I'm really highly focused so it's
like a rich red were rich yellow I'm

468
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,050
actually very targeted one machine on
the other hand

469
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:43,110
and if it's like a green or light blue
or pink it sort of spread out the upper

470
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:50,630
right hand is how big my bite and
basically that looks at the size of the

471
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,200
package size relative to the flow cuz
we're looking at net flows and flows in

472
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,100
the bites are aggregated but we can
still calculate the total number of

473
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:03,470
bytes relative to the number of stuff
conversations the machine is having so

474
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:10,000
basically in this case if i'm looking at
again and nice

475
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,520
in this case different cuz I'm the
yellows are very focused you know stop

476
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:24,390
small number of very large conversations
the reds and blues and purples are large

477
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:29,930
conversations but pretty well spread out
the one in the middle is how many nodes

478
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,910
are hitting me in the lower left is how
many nodes in my hitting and then the

479
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:40,620
bottom right hand is promiscuity so
actually the yellow the yellow boxes and

480
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:44,060
that one mean that I'm actually not very
promiscuous I'm actually fairly

481
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:50,060
monogamous machine whereas the darker
boxes in fact there are some red ones

482
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:54,890
that pop up as you run the video darker
boxes in the red boxes of the machines

483
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:58,210
that are talking to lots of different
machines and I think one of the things

484
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:02,200
that we've been trying to get out with
these is you know what this really cool

485
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:07,339
sort of a task duration we can show it
to someone who's not necessarily an

486
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:11,360
expert in network engineering or
analytics and say ok point that the

487
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,440
thing that lights up when I first
started looking at these you know this

488
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,800
cluster down here right it shows up in
plots so there's something you know

489
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,110
you're actually it's not bad because
when you do the color key you find out

490
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:28,420
they're actually pretty consistent
machines that are fairly monogamous and

491
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:32,390
so you know something that has been
going on for a really long time they're

492
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:40,879
doing what they're supposed to be doing
as I run knowing where I see all this

493
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,940
data from

494
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,880
in these days it for a long time I know
that does that the cluster of machines

495
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:54,800
on the bottom in the center is the
infrastructure machine so your Active

496
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,470
Directory years which is your router's
your mail servers and stuff like that so

497
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:04,509
they're pretty consistent in their
functions what they do and then got

498
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:10,970
around throughout the plot some of them
are in a DTP range and some of the other

499
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:15,740
network which is it was kind of funny
know in this video as we get around 29

500
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,939
30 seconds I know that sort of lights up
in the middle and changes color really

501
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:25,910
quickly right and then it goes sort of
goes away rights to this note shows up

502
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:29,649
starts changing behaviors and then goes
away and I don't know what the heck that

503
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:33,869
needs doing what part of the premise of
this is that I don't have to write I can

504
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:37,400
now say ok I need the IP address for
this machine and when you look at the

505
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,339
machine and see what it's doing is
everything else has kind of nice

506
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:44,049
consistent behavior and this gets back
to the point of meeting earlier you know

507
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:48,460
as an analytics guy right when Rob told
me what we don't have any outcomes you

508
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:54,180
know after I sort of recovered from that
ok so we have to be looking for stuff we

509
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,069
have to be able to very quickly identify
when you're changing your behavior right

510
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:03,540
so it's not about saying I know this is
good or ban or this or that but hey this

511
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,599
machine just changed its showed up

512
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,910
change its behavior and went away which
may be legit but now you know where to

513
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,879
look

514
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:26,690
ok we ready for questions because I have
now is the contact area

515
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:39,369
answer any questions

516
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:49,130
the question was what do for quality 513
dreams mean yes the data spewing

517
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:54,670
basically we're using a kurtosis metric
which is how peaked the distribution is

518
00:45:54,670 --> 00:46:01,289
how focused it is and we're comparing
the bite the port based by outflows of

519
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:07,249
the node to the destination ports that
are receiving those bites and then we're

520
00:46:07,249 --> 00:46:08,558
adjusting that for how much

521
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:15,210
inbound traffic coming back to the
machine the upper right quadrant we are

522
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:20,690
comparing the bites out down from the
machine to their conversations on the

523
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:24,099
destination side right so subtly
different so what is the amount of data

524
00:46:24,099 --> 00:46:28,519
the other is how many different
conversations in my happening and we're

525
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,479
also adjusting in all of these cases
were adjusting them for the amount of

526
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,430
inbound traffic coming back

527
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:40,490
the center for Injury is basically
looking at how concentrated my outbound

528
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:46,848
data flows are along with the balance of
inbound vs outbound traffic right so my

529
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:52,720
mostly sending or receiving the lower
left quadrant is the same thing except

530
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,598
reversing

531
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,109
in the center point it's biased towards
inbound traffic in the bottom left

532
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:03,660
wondering it's biased towards outbound
traffic and then in the bottom right

533
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,129
hand we're doing the same idea of the of
the kurtosis at the distribution

534
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:12,950
relative to the number of IP's that I'm
connecting to my inbound and outbound

535
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:17,649
flows eg how many machinery basically
it's like taking all your friends and

536
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:21,380
drawing a map of how much you're talking
to your friends and then saying okay I

537
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,420
might just a one-person some I like a
super duper introverted with one person

538
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:31,039
I talked to or am I like ultra
extroverted I'm talking to anybody up I

539
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:33,230
think we're getting that done

540
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:37,590
thanks guys
