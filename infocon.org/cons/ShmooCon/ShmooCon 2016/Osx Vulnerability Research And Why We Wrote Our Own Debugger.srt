1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,029
basically ready so without any further I
don't know how many of you guys done

2
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:13,469
research on OSX lleve and GB suck balls
so hopefully we will learn about a new

3
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,289
to bloggers that we make OSX research
much less painful so without any further

4
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:21,170
ado please give a warm welcome

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:30,359
Tyler Brayton you don't get your hopes
to address a bit so it's not super great

6
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,350
hope you can get a new set of stuff
other concepts but some great content

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,730
just got a great time is agreeable
security time not just so ya never know

8
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,949
who we are

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:52,289
researchers 44 basis times we do we do
exploitation prevention detection and

10
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,410
creation large envelope reverse
engineering and bug on CNN previously

11
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,660
we'd been most then windows but this
this we started diving OS X and that's

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,000
one of the songs about so give you a
little bit of background about how this

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,159
all began

14
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,509
we had this poser and it's a funny story
because we spent like few weeks months

15
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:21,310
years trying and writing a father and
it's really like language where and

16
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,610
smart advancing as old school shit and
just on verifying the output from the

17
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,759
buzzer doesn't even like generating
stuff so like we run it and it generates

18
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,310
a handful files and then we like just
opened them and like on file like one

19
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:42,000
it does this safari and so we're like
like how lucky like we just tumbled into

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,729
light Safari bugs and then well yeah so
we we put the trash like maybe we should

21
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,280
use you know we should figure this out
like like what what is this guy who's

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,170
this crash it's like we're really good
at Windows Linux refinery gdb we love

23
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,140
winter bug we've written to bloggers for
both compete races also in the Windows

24
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:08,090
API is like unparalleled feature rich
really helpful awesome well-documented

25
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,870
correct and documentation everything
that Apple is not so we were like man we

26
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,370
can just about this so we we pop open
lol TV and we're like okay now would and

27
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,170
likeness is a novel debugger those
pretty cool how nice of this really cool

28
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,700
novel the bugger know is it a novel to
bugger but it's actually debugging novel

29
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:35,579
so to get anything done in a while BB
you have to write like you know like

30
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,760
legalese basically it's it's sort of
like inefficient and unusable its

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,929
feature rich in Austin has a bunch of
cool stuff that I started like does not

32
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,489
at all not at all for the record Ltd is
awesome and super feature-rich really

33
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:54,850
well tested for what it does it just
doesn't do what we needed and will get

34
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,880
more into what that means but did you
guys an example if any of your how many

35
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,959
gb

36
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,500
so and I don't know me if you're feeling
depressed myself by seeing other people

37
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,750
hurts all I can ask for raises hands but
if you see eg beat him and we all know

38
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:19,220
like an 04 / some size WX memory address
how do you achieve that in leb you start

39
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,350
with deer LOD become

40
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,390
and you're right this you read this
small

41
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:32,600
si in order to get access and like that
she's doing memory right what would you

42
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:41,780
want to do something so we wanted to
bility and LDB does run scripts but it's

43
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,550
an environment that load scripts not
something you can script from outside of

44
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:51,330
that environment and so we we wanted to
we could write scripts for complex

45
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,560
scenarios like crazy memory tracking you
like I want to put in my house treated

46
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,550
you keep up with something to prove
their references anywhere else in this

47
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,140
complex range to write the scripts and
then load in the script will show you

48
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:10,708
why here in a minute but when you when
I'm W Dr should I got a bug going around

49
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,610
exploit I like to read a lot of scripts
to reproduce the conditions analyze

50
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,669
things around and whatever else so
that's that's why we wanted this article

51
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:24,630
is available but it's mostly meant for
use inside of it and it's not the same

52
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,310
as what we would normally want so let's
let's see what we mean by that like you

53
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:35,550
see here you've got you've had this
import LDB this function this is this is

54
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,620
a sample taken from a blog by the way
and and where you can see his like its

55
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,479
architects fortress to set a single
break point this is a single break point

56
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:52,690
like why is it 10 lines is as its anyway
so you can see that like we have we have

57
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,060
a single break point where we have
strings to refer to a function as a call

58
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,020
back in the same in the same piece of
code River done basically like this is

59
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,450
not how programming should be for
anything scriptable and like these words

60
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,680
just like so verbose target breakpoint
create by name and then in quotes like

61
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,419
the function you want this is so many
words like many words of the time it's

62
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:17,650
like it's like you get the joy of
writing Java with the speed in type

63
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,750
safety of Python

64
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,050
just so many words like how would you
get if you actually get something done

65
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,500
how did you get any of those words into
like a single line you have to be Busta

66
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:35,910
Rhymes and by the way this look at this
latest handle commits we've written a

67
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,460
spot we went to load the file in the
file which already was preferential

68
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:45,310
remember from 15 lines up in this thing
you have to run the command is yo dawg I

69
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:51,070
heard you like writing commanding your
debugger script commands us to go back

70
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,020
to the debugger to run the command that
tells the script about the test test

71
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,180
test

72
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,180
toussaud's tostitos I don't know right
away

73
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,510
script ability the one thing about this
is that there's no way you can just

74
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,820
script its functionality from outside of
it you can run LDB and you can call

75
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:12,219
scripts with that awesome syntax but you
can't you can't just be like yo Dawg

76
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,690
analytical script and here's here's what
inspired us here's what we're used to

77
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,770
wear paper because of like this and like
DDB type things where his be traced

78
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,180
right a break point where most of the
slide is actually me describing be trace

79
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,650
where the other side was a wall of text
a text for traceability be as you can

80
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,060
see here just like important thing right
a callback break point equals call back

81
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,770
at it at the break point which one
simple concise functionality and so like

82
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,909
this is one good run inside the BBB
here's one that you tried to take stand

83
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:46,650
alone and like that's really where we
were trying to go by the way by we I

84
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,539
mean Tyler I this idea and I was like I
really want to write this and so I i'm

85
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,250
i'm like 39 dead from hacking so like
any good manager was like you should

86
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,350
write this and Tyler are all the cool
shit that's in the stock throw that out

87
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:08,520
there my mom I'm here is his family
mostly that being said the first thing

88
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,240
about any good research project is your
research what else there is

89
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,900
this bit slicer is probably best to
bugger outside of LGB that you can find

90
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,568
it's very similar to when the bug in
fact that it is very easily using a GUI

91
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,150
is great do is watch points really
integrated with the check to see what is

92
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,770
a game cheat engine that's what it's
used for but with that you can read

93
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,680
member you can write member you can
separate points where lacks is actually

94
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,650
part it does work with Python as a
python framework but it's very very

95
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,810
limited and its you can tell it's four
games in four games but if you just want

96
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,970
to meet in your program this is a great
tool to use so it's nice it was really

97
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,280
something that I also took a lot from my
god I took a lot of ideas and

98
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,549
methodologies that this site uses and
put them in a bunker of democracy is

99
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,539
probably five or six years old and has
written for PowerPC or 32 bit Intel

100
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:02,759
versions using voice commands it simply
don't exist anymore

101
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,889
uses old versions of the commands of
detail later and it simply just couldn't

102
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:13,470
is not nearly ready for 64 bit processor
and as I'm mostly snow is only 64 bit

103
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:19,070
now so that basically useless it's also
in Ruby who used to be anymore

104
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:27,300
securities little thing of beauty be but
I see Windows Linux OS X kind of treat

105
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,079
me right now has no sense in some
sections except exception servers in a

106
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:38,260
sense of two break points it's really
liking so that that led us to a see back

107
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,208
and that could maybe even be supported
by b2b at some point out that way but

108
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:51,089
that was so how do we get there and
books are our great 2006 and was it

109
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:55,839
apart BC as well but despite the power
PC to be almost more useful than the

110
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,430
more modern version

111
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,250
they're both great books and there's a
pretty pretty much between these two

112
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:11,089
books you could write you can do it we
did so we had to work with us before we

113
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:15,970
went on to the next and they're all very
well documented if you google debugger

114
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,149
you get nothing you go out to be a good
thing you get nothing nothing comes up

115
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:24,750
with this was the first place I looked
like peter is my choice must work to the

116
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:31,300
features of work hours you work I was
just for reference

117
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:39,229
all this following slides are all the
back and see will get more things so you

118
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,750
can have a better understanding of how
democracy works in the back end at its

119
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,190
core this is just a framework we've done
by these things on top of it but if you

120
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,940
want to write no jst wanna write
whatever you want this should be

121
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,160
accessible to any language that that was
kind of one of the big ideas it's very

122
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,579
easy plug plug and play so how do we do
it so I started retrace

123
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,350
attaching and detaching doesn't allow
you to attach that's gonna fuck your

124
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:14,380
program you never see you again peter is
a test continued flag and LGBT race

125
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,870
there's no people both memory so busy
this point I just drew AP choice there's

126
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,760
also like nofollow for things like a lot
of things that they've like it's like

127
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:29,060
Apple took like an obvious he's awesome
enjoy and like and that's like right so

128
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,229
he chases not work

129
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,589
totally useless but you will find
everything bugger for OSX use it and I

130
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:41,660
didn't know why I just do the way I did
you try to call when I started my

131
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,520
research I can hear informed us on the
right is she doesn't June 2006 that's a

132
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,610
ten year old blog post but this is
actually one of the most helpful blogs

133
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,700
like fines and even though sold just a
little information on the buggy and

134
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,920
these are the things that so the stock
is Canada China show everybody

135
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:13,329
demystified if you will make it less
scary just ask her PhD and give you a

136
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:18,510
port number and that port number is used
and all the guys from here on out so

137
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,089
anything you want to keep you remember
right memory separate points all that

138
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:24,829
kind of stuff you need to support number
of course this is your attaching what

139
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:29,459
was interesting about a year in
attaching a non-invasive to the process

140
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:33,540
the process doesn't know that you have
attached to its not really attaching in

141
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,880
that sort of it doesn't change in
behavior the process much like if you're

142
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,650
attaching and it starts it's things like
its attached like the heat goes into

143
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:49,910
things this is so far detach from that
no pun intended that like it all those

144
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,870
checks if you have any sort of like like
iTunes for instance as a present check

145
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,949
at the beginning they have no no
knowledge of what we're doing it as it

146
00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:01,459
would have no way of knowing that we
attached to it so just an interesting

147
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:07,729
idea that happened to come by the way we
designed this is just the market API's

148
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,380
for reading writing memory this takes
care of Peter a smoke test pump that I

149
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:18,290
poked user of those things are taken
over by these funny la KPI's you'll also

150
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,610
notice that uses just VMware and VMware
instead of mock is guaranteed to work or

151
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:29,450
64 bit so that's why that's why we went
with Mark yet 30 after 32

152
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:36,770
stayed pretty pretty straight forward
again as give us more of the beach race

153
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,590
functionality than the big change comes
an exception handling those with peter

154
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,680
is what you can do is you can just a
process and the way you can't wait for

155
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,760
some very fun event happen to signal to
come

156
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,240
that's not how it works here we have to
register with the current on the kernel

157
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,030
get the message to pass it up to the
answer so it will send a lube infinitely

158
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,970
waiting and when it gets when it gets a
message that passes off to catch

159
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:07,070
exception raised its notice the stuff on
those things are passed to it there's no

160
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,570
real way of knowing what break point
here or what happened what caused this

161
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:18,480
to happen so we had to do was have to
keep a lot of internal state to keep

162
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,010
track of what is actually break points
what caused the exceptions happen and

163
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:32,030
overhead for the exceptions so does is
it catches signal failure signals so

164
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,350
signals tell you that a process that
process exited

165
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:41,280
tell you anything that happened so what
can we do that's where we introduce this

166
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,750
idea cues take uses another thing that's
left over BST I don't even think I

167
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,180
really meant to keep it in there is just
a legacy music oh that's happened to be

168
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,630
there but give us the ability to track a
Strikeforce Dec exact track signals it

169
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:04,210
also gives you a million other things
like this happen to be the one that we

170
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:18,390
used for just a notification to do with
that so you can register and and that

171
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:25,670
will then choose what to do with those
generals half of what it looks like

172
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:31,120
ok event is the message when you came
and get something it'll drop down and it

173
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,080
ends with these bits to see what
actually happened and then they'll do

174
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,990
stuff ASAP

175
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:44,950
cause notice that we have no 40 child in
checker those are things that will allow

176
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:50,550
you to follow fork so if no tracker is
not tell us the child PID is this great

177
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:55,300
read and follow for it but you can
follow for LGBT I was wondering why and

178
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,149
this is definitely one reason why those
things happening they needed this call

179
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:02,610
which makes it impossible for us to file
for so we had to try to buy some

180
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:09,310
workarounds and get that working in a
different way so that's it for like I

181
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,089
was actually journals just a more recent
protection that's come out just as

182
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:14,480
interesting for the bugging

183
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,080
protection it was introduced in
September and I'll Capitan and

184
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,839
essentially just blocks where you can
write and two blocks from you so every

185
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,270
Apple program you can attest to any way
you can certainly flags in the programs

186
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,290
of the apples in a certain path you can
attach to it

187
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:46,010
system user has been you can write to
him at all and I'll be in a sales call

188
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:50,560
you get a very easy-to-use able to
disable this but for attackers and such

189
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,119
as many blocks lateral movement and
makes it much more difficult to write

190
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:07,670
whatever these things that exploit man
later we've run is protected in numerous

191
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,130
times it's because I didn't like huge
pain in the ass to deal with this

192
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:20,200
direction so we've been turning off and
on all times and then we have our little

193
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,660
bugger we not there's nothing fancy but
we have a little thing that weekend

194
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,870
program you test program an exact over
it it will map the new Safari or

195
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,629
whatever into that address space and
you're still attached to it

196
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:39,910
this analogy be a book they break ties I
can they don't work anymore so if you

197
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,719
try just the same protection to be like
hey I'm done I can't do anything but

198
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,560
because our our program doesn't care if
all the exact close as far into it and

199
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,540
we can bypass it and use it on any
program you want with it was very simple

200
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,589
commands do and it works very well

201
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:09,409
internals easy to use interface way out
to be a very very very heavy and

202
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:15,870
scripted get that letter writer on that
these guys are usually you can go out

203
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:20,658
find a tool that works and use it in a
way so much time writing on stuff but at

204
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:25,169
the same time is actually really cool to
learn a lot about the internals and

205
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:30,490
spent a lot of time understanding how it
differs from BSD from the decks from

206
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:40,549
some of the other our goal was never to
replace LGB Ltd has a ridiculous amount

207
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:45,039
of functionality it would take years
they spent years writing such a great

208
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,549
debugger the problem with that those yet
to read a novel to understand how to use

209
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:54,918
it and LDB scripting yes it's very
verbose it's not easy that's easy to use

210
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:04,289
interface we did not offer this so that
continues on far further than I could

211
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:10,408
ever to never put slides on there's 2008
by time functions available to be I

212
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:13,669
would take a few weeks just to
understand understand all these

213
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:17,919
functions also if you google LDB
scripting there's like four examples

214
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,620
website

215
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,689
website there's one example and it
doesn't it doesn't even really do

216
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,430
anything it's just that the brake
cleaner sources said luxury to find it

217
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:33,160
find a node that's all it does not only
reference when I don't want to read this

218
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,510
reference I spent like two or three
weeks reading the reference to try to

219
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:45,870
understand this before we decided to go
away so more time at this fund Ltd

220
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:52,959
scripts and then there's an introduction
to what are like it's very similar b2b

221
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,240
not exactly be but very similar about
five miles goes it should be pretty

222
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:11,980
straightforward interesting ideas of the
season case you rather be trace a david

223
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,559
hasn't hasn't downfalls with it but it
also has a lot of websites the fact that

224
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,690
were not amazed at the process means we
can attach and detach from processes

225
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,179
multiple times without adding ever
happening that process i contested

226
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:27,160
process reduced memory try to find
strings do different things to it and it

227
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,950
never knows I was there well as other
kinds of lazy such as servicing so when

228
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,280
you register a second server

229
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,240
the program that knows you're there
that's that that is a base of the

230
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,820
program

231
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,320
exception service and exceptional habits
now going to your acceptance of what we

232
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,490
do is we don't miss a second server and
so as a necessary process memory or you

233
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,020
just want to be around inside a process
you never going to Vegas recession

234
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,400
service that way the program never know
you're there you don't have to worry

235
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,150
about running out of money out of such
importance you don't worry about that

236
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:01,799
sort of stuff and lots of other
processes ones

237
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:13,450
we have is that code injection is that
code allocating memory and writes a cozy

238
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,850
device capable in that in that memory
great thread so you can easily backdoor

239
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,719
programs you could easily inject
yourself in another program sponsored by

240
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,139
threatening of that program running
inside of your program running inside

241
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:26,779
another program very easily

242
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:31,419
unfortunately are set by passing lot
work on that case so rumors that there

243
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:39,139
are other ways he runs it we haven't had
time to dive in the Sept but I'm sure

244
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:47,979
that's not too bad to get around a
simple example showing that I can test

245
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,179
of 10 prices at once and just putting a
list and then I have been processed

246
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:55,869
about you and there's really no there's
no way you can do that I love you

247
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:58,609
without having ten different terminal in
his opening testing all different end of

248
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:02,939
a 210 terminal windows and commands
frenzies over and over and over

249
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:18,570
try to get around so that you like it I
have a dinner for you this is done by it

250
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,939
because I like Python Python lots people
like pythons are most likely time but

251
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,389
with the rise of languages like node.js
that's totally possible to take these

252
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:33,439
and exports industry braverman OJSC
repin whatever they could reach using we

253
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,119
didn't want to make anything very
specific pipeline is really just

254
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,340
wrappers around

255
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,580
revolves around this rumor that it's
nothing special

256
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,870
it shouldn't take if you look at the
coalition take you a couple days to

257
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,590
write

258
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:50,580
rappers node.js trappers anywhere near
everyone is just as export function it's

259
00:21:50,580 --> 00:22:01,010
very easy to extend it's also easy to
see so I don't know about you guys but

260
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:07,570
I've actually already in the pipeline so
you can show you that is all very very

261
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,340
easy to use it see if you don't want to
use the overhead up i think is a lot

262
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:15,510
slower you can easily do all this and
see so there's a recap because it was

263
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:19,158
fine set of events like the talks
started out as like burger here so we

264
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:22,409
wrote it might be rooted but along the
way we stumbled into like when we rode a

265
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:28,039
than we ever wanted so we start with the
likes of fiery crash rather like

266
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:33,129
lawson's for your day we need to call
the bugger in times like right now and

267
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,870
he's like men Nike panic in the kernel
with these days so now we're going to

268
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:46,168
make this kernel based on this is
actually two of them one of which is not

269
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:50,210
as reliable as the others we've got like
one really consistent line and then we

270
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,750
stumbled into two or he's all into
what's great about that those while

271
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,870
writing the slides and finding jokes and
putting Busta Rhymes in our slides we

272
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,979
kill keynote so we've got some key no
bugs as well reproducible and then we'd

273
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:10,870
read keno and Ida and guess what
happened just throwing that out there is

274
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,479
a recap of our of our process event and
now now the hilarity of the talk begins

275
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,000
with a bunch of a couple bucks just a
heads up the Safari but he hasn't passed

276
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,090
in the latest version of Safari they
just pass it so I can demo for you want

277
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:28,260
to be in with overs and sorry but has
been passing fortunately the keynote and

278
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:39,908
to us accent because I crash in your own
just get by Kino put it in your done so

279
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:46,690
I'll do it for you if you want but don't
have to physically show as a prank yeah

280
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:55,730
yeah yeah yeah I lied about their pranks
bro I was gonna go in a couple of demos

281
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,280
as soon as the basis of the code and
then I have a couple of slightly more

282
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:05,360
verbose temas but I miss you can hear my
screens are like two seconds

283
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:15,260
computers

284
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:27,129
easier cuz I can't see any bigger

285
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:44,380
I was going to be the example of a
bigger they are good so it's basically

286
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,500
how it works is that the Great Plains
like this you get a break points by

287
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,590
address you get a break from my office
that you can I bring my name 2000 simple

288
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:59,790
stuff I C Jordan over there and as the
authors are currently using your

289
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:04,310
personal writing your own person is just
not done yet but we have included you

290
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:09,429
guys are you people think your stuff so
unfortunately super simple parsing code

291
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:13,310
until we publish our terrible code
leaders afternoon and we're gonna put a

292
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,010
link to your stuff but your partner's
awesome but we're making our own it says

293
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,470
we would always bugging stepping down as
so many problems and try to get the

294
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,450
stupid things that I spent the past week
dealing with these crappy bugs internal

295
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,250
crisis and all these things are trying
to get it going

296
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,510
attempted to spend more time to begin
Aquino day rather than writing about

297
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:40,450
your key noting so you know all these
other similar stuff is from its minutes

298
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:47,330
he brought them by name but when I asked
that I call backs and you come back and

299
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,919
you really do anything this one just as
a pretty print thing I made for the talk

300
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,290
so that's nice and all you really do it
just do despite a charitable government

301
00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:04,230
and that's it

302
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,110
everything is be run as root by the way
I that's one thing I think we need to

303
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,110
get over you have to be ready to begin
anything

304
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:19,159
yeah so they discover a point ahead this
is a pretty printing the print out some

305
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,360
registers for you and then it was a bit
assembly we depend on capstone we don't

306
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,020
have costumes finds that out and we're
told us that race to the bottom think is

307
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:34,400
text segments blue is data segment green
adjusted assembly and showing a

308
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,580
different point of it if you noticed
that we have break for my kids

309
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:43,830
90 this is a function the function
arguments are 123 and it was supposed to

310
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,159
print I went to three budgets for
demonstrate we put on 1993 does it so

311
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,720
that we can separate state gets date on
some stuff just just shown the basics

312
00:26:50,720 --> 00:27:01,520
reading and reading frame every stuff
together I thought it was going to leave

313
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,639
a memory is allocated page A 82 it means
hello I just don't those occasions

314
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,880
approves actually working and then I
searched through them to make sure that

315
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,230
I'm actually getting the same things
here and there are such things work

316
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:18,169
researcher blue eyes blue is in the
binary but it also shows up when the

317
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:23,350
ones and then the sex them some stuff if
you know this one is the same one that

318
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:28,080
we injected earlier just to prove that
everything is working as we say it's

319
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,810
working out the keynote

320
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:47,240
so very very well it's not like the most
useful thing in the world but you can

321
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:54,930
fall 2009 something happens to one which
one of which what I'm looking at is very

322
00:27:54,930 --> 00:28:25,670
easy to do this or is it would be very
difficult to do so obviously with 32

323
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:35,110
memory using it so I just wanna look for
me to just for fun sake and he's

324
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:40,030
definitely going for here mp3 and this
is gonna start the program every and try

325
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:47,899
to find which programs have this that's
bad

326
00:28:47,900 --> 00:29:09,680
to do this via sea surges or services
programs there was some solutions

327
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,140
sometimes it doesn't work but they got
so we can tell the first program has

328
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,910
always been the other programs come up
with some solutions as well because they

329
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:25,140
also have memory from the first DLC is
bound up from 40 so you know if you look

330
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:35,850
for a bit three it should only come in
the last one

331
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:44,320
and its officers in a whole program
program that a space that's kind of way

332
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:51,009
the first program so they inherit the
memory for the first month that's why i

333
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:59,480
cant find all of them but we look for
just last month the next one is so don't

334
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,070
buy a break from our it's great for
packing but it's also cool for Apple

335
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,710
because I think they're very cool and
equip their binaries they have this what

336
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:13,419
they call a protected binaries think of
things they mostly comprised of

337
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:17,370
proprietary information they don't want
you to be overrun Apple software on

338
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:22,258
other hard work so they could think of
some of their very key programs to make

339
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:29,710
sure that you can set up your hardware
to work on their way to reduce offer but

340
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,860
the problem with encryption is they have
to decrypt it ever on time Italy by fast

341
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,699
ship we all these programs will be
understood because of our programs all

342
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,039
our programs are protected from
beginning so we bypassed Sep we can

343
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:47,389
easily jump out the memory and we can
then potentially subversive we could do

344
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:53,678
with everyone with at that point so
today that I am going to use strings on

345
00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:01,139
the binary industry I thought that
probably should be inside of the three

346
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:07,459
how life can imagine would probably be
in there because I don't because it must

347
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,529
be because it involves having that the
word name then named Apple in them so

348
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:16,269
was great patronizing the medication was
just approved you that's an encrypted

349
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:22,519
binary run it again nothing and actually
see it as indicated by an area probably

350
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:32,610
don't care anyway

351
00:31:32,610 --> 00:32:12,629
again it all works well so you just do
you really want to run it sit there and

352
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:30,190
wait for you here at 08 / Python and you
put in a number 743 process over here

353
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:35,510
and enter it does and doesn't call
decrypt up in here under strings

354
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:53,650
undercooked been and then we search for
Apple again when I just was these

355
00:32:53,650 --> 00:33:19,730
you can actually see the real reason I
promise

356
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:29,200
dub in its organization created because
so it doesn't have to but if you notice

357
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,940
if you don't have any of the other major
point of living now you have actual code

358
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,660
and you can actually do something with
this university you could do whatever

359
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,400
you want with it to figure out how to
get rid of every trying to work with its

360
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,310
as easy simple way to bypass the
binaries and cash over there were texans

361
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:50,629
aren't necessarily the most things in
the world

362
00:33:50,630 --> 00:34:02,140
back to keynote for many more good one
so it is 2016 and never remembers

363
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:08,750
2009 you know in a few of your posts
stuff about binaries on Windows that you

364
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:15,580
could just drop city by and you were
money so I very funny little thing a

365
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:21,370
test to see what time I say it's like
this clarify I mean the position to ask

366
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,139
you apart

367
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:28,710
loading the text saying that the Bayside
every time I don't mean to keep I mean

368
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,159
by where the bay side of the program is
the same every time so i was just

369
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,770
curious as to what this is about
programs are doing this so

370
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:45,040
so let's kill us some stuff how he went
about doing this was a movie star

371
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:58,310
Jennifer Fox to like firefighters movies
with so then I went and I found that

372
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:02,390
Firefox is every time

373
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:07,450
ok let's see what else I can find so
that I wanted to download the torrent I

374
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:12,089
used transmission that's my personal
favorite times I am so I do it again and

375
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,620
noticed here

376
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,529
transmission shows up ok fine I won't
download any video transmission from my

377
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,400
computer so I open up the OC cuz you'll
see the change the aspect ratio as

378
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,080
QuickTime doesn't so everybody's BSE I
do it again and noticed that way you'll

379
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,790
see also doesn't have also doesn't have
this stream from popcorn time you know

380
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:40,620
that russia's Foreign streaming site
from there ok so I read it again this

381
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:48,120
one is talking time so you know what
fuck this I'm in Wisconsin on Windows go

382
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:54,060
there I come back I do it again and
noticed

383
00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:00,029
VMware VMware VMware so all these
programs I had my computer just to have

384
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:04,050
a good time ensured money and most of us
have different different programs I do

385
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:09,320
so these are just the ones I personally
had and all I can really say is that all

386
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,920
our programs but a large amount binaries
are not from Apple

387
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,480
i think is a huge security problem
people be aware of I didn't I was

388
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,390
definitely not aware of this until a
couple days ago when I wrote this I

389
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:45,109
think most of you probably know as well
as it's very interesting I would say

390
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:48,840
somewhere between alpha and beta a
diesel and needs one for us rewrite

391
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,850
leaders we have eight search memory
functions right now when I could have

392
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:55,700
just one it's the problem is with all
these grasses and things I've ever the

393
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:01,669
kernel of the problems I've been having
having a time 2013 right so please I

394
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:04,730
really hope you guys will check it out
and look at it but it was in the next

395
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,710
month I imagine going to a whole new
naming system in a whole new things that

396
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:13,080
you start writing scripts where it is
probably not gonna work we need few

397
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:19,020
things that much points testing
functionality as a must go to the test I

398
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:24,680
may I wrote a search string function
yesterday just for this certainly wasn't

399
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:31,029
quite and then to do stuff in the
current Okino Safari just gotta stop

400
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:34,570
doing that too that's not working out
too well for me

401
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:43,960
I just listened to a lot of people and
they felt like there was no real area go

402
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,270
and find all the information you to find
about OS X in about setting up the

403
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,009
bugger if you go through and you look at
these

404
00:37:53,010 --> 00:38:00,450
give or take blogs you should easily
build a brighter side of things and it's

405
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:04,299
not about these lines are more really
just try to put all of those extra

406
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:10,810
bugging me stuff into one area and then
these are some of our team that helped

407
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:19,799
works on the program with me and so
don't ask questions yet we're not done

408
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,920
but the code over these are probably a
little bit later remove US East Coast

409
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,470
before I pushed and then I'll be ready
to push themselves to make it to do this

410
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:37,680
on it so that you know how to put ready
to go back and make it work but thats

411
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:51,299
that and then alright so as an FYI for
hopper here I know I know democrats I

412
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:57,780
could put it on

413
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:08,920
we found we found this while also trying
to reverse things so that happens and

414
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:14,660
Sophia report you can see it is about
accessing this happen while trying to

415
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,480
simply trying to debunk some of the
programs were doing so that is a big

416
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,320
setback for us and then we were like oh
that's right some stuff Aquino and I

417
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:33,500
write these cool pictures with these fun
things in their shadows keno and then I

418
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,330
got one more thing for you but i wanna
see the codebase real two seconds I want

419
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:44,040
to say you're doing and I've been here
but I guess I guess I don't you think of

420
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,840
it that way

421
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:50,540
searching this way it's pretty
straightforward the source file this

422
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:58,460
policy files I see examples in here and
has all the examples and all the

423
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:06,590
findings of stuff erupted in lives here
they are more from lives and lives where

424
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:11,560
all the stuff lives so anybody here the
sparse file will be deleted

425
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:17,630
to get this program running go to buy
the ninja get up take take his Marco

426
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:22,320
para ser and put it here and it work

427
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,420
license to a solid that'd be great

428
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:33,480
licensing issues problem that's ok
though and then so its 440 were

429
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,830
literally but that's ok I'm not
releasing the guys that they have a

430
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:45,400
chance to myself yet so I don't want to
release all day without at least testing

431
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,000
at first and see you through the money
cuz i dont wanna give you guys free

432
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:02,470
money supply run that fast wares and you
buy any questions comments concerns are

433
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:14,279
you can't see the screen is way funnier
it's it's a bunch of spaghetti

434
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:32,070
think about the things and if you can
find new ideas about just trying to do

435
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:39,500
stuff today and it's got 54 times I've
said enough so there's there's a kernel

436
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,680
problems in his own security problems in
general so that's kind of a decrease in

437
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,569
stock I like the democrats great
everything but the state of Ohio

438
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:56,180
security is a little wacky but they did
they do work except not really I still

439
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:02,960
not doing anything I don't know how it's
a stock I think I deserve any questions

440
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:12,600
comments concerns that sir

441
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:17,600
you don't you don't you don't get the
you get the ability to halt notify and

442
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,180
then resumed at the thing that just
tells you that something happened

443
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:25,440
choices like it you know you hold up to
a signal to choose what to do and it

444
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,100
continues this is just something
happened it just tells you it's up to

445
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,279
the users of this week we have is we
have a theory of registering this

446
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,550
exception you can recession servers and
your success in callbacks

447
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,520
exception call back in then do stuff
with that message but by the hall is a

448
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,880
safe haven for cabin so what we've been
working on writing and stuff is a four

449
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,400
Captains ok let's break on that for work
and that's all that work that was a big

450
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,080
thing we try to do and unfortunately we
got him a time but right we've got going

451
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,120
to inject into a into for Canada Ltd
which is no return address child process

452
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,910
and we can touch the no new codes excuse
in the jaw process until you tax and

453
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:05,359
then and then not that out but you can
do that no LDB if you're a masochist and

454
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:11,930
and what if a ballot for the lines of
code but like the delay but you know

455
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:18,520
it's it's one of the things we will not
be released until tomorrow and try to

456
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,509
put the code this afternoon but dinner
here is used as kind of shitty so it

457
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:27,270
might not get out till tomorrow but if
you just take out get up to a concise

458
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:41,100
history just restarts on my twitter
tweet tweet to him if you follow us but

459
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:46,870
it will be at this link it is private
right now and I guess others posted its

460
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,740
fine

461
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:59,580
we love you I was really small thing
thank you guys for these the binary

462
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:06,770
ninja guys for just for right now just
realized help us out

463
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:28,800
answer

464
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,720
yeah we just didn't have a way to review
the questions I think he is said to be

465
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,509
weekend passes and re looking more in
ways we can work around six and one that

466
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:47,800
we showed was just using exact we're
like something and then blah standard

467
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,970
system call it works with so that lets
you bypass the fact that like Justin

468
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:57,439
Harris the other dietary there are other
things you can do while running but we

469
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:12,310
we are going to that are you are you are
amazing shots secrets

470
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:21,549
Taylor has extensive we have we have a
book on these days the promise of

471
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:29,490
observing tool you can observe it in the
works to the bugger so you can get the

472
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:33,240
output of things and you just amazing

473
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,919
introspection it's only analysis you can
get information but we were looking for

474
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:44,300
introspection and inject code that is
amazing it's wonderful to have been put

475
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:56,670
aside about it yeah I think about it and
other questions thank you all so very

476
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:02,560
central server and then you will ever
hear everyone already see by there and

477
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,410
when that cc-by gets it we have a
structure that hold on break points

478
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:13,190
that's ECB gets hit in from the sea by
we can see what address that hit from

479
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,700
the address we can look to our internal
structure a mess it up to the break yes

480
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:23,680
I think things lately win over Lakers it
like you start out a non-invasive too

481
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,839
bad we're like we're just observing
things you can read memory whatever when

482
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,410
you add a break point on the back end
the debugger registers an exception

483
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,350
handler for options are for you so until
you do something like that of a corner

484
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:37,870
whatever the program is no way of
knowing you're attached we do that

485
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:42,490
though the lazy binding as exceptions
are the exceptions were then catches

486
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:50,089
when the the sink trap happens and 333
happens and yeah just like a bit the

487
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:53,530
data correlate right back to bite
single-step whatever your standards and

488
00:46:53,530 --> 00:47:06,760
behavior that we just we I don't know
why there's a terrible at another

489
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,720
democracy didn't we didn't change
anything

490
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:14,700
following you just can't you just stay
attached just doesn't do that lol TV

491
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,660
doesn't do that yeah it's really like to
have to anything special for the exact

492
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,930
like no just casually works out to be
really convenient isn't exactly they

493
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,629
bail they say I can do that what we do
is we just let the let the exact map

494
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:37,240
over private place just about it yes we
so we we we do this we basically we

495
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,069
we've seen very point at the PLT we
inject any return addresses for doesn't

496
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:47,900
actually take it we must do whatever you
want so when they returned just goes to

497
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,710
work ok that spins the child process for
its just sit there returns the spins

498
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:55,360
pins you attach to it no new Xcode
excuse in the child process you then not

499
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,710
that cold cave and then it goes under
return return goes to the original

500
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,510
testing out
