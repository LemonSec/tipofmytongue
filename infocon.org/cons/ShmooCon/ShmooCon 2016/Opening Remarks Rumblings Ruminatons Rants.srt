1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,239
Chris just said that he doesn't use the
podium mic at a very controversial

2
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:23,250
statement I guess is exactly exactly
move around the whole goddamn podium can

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:36,790
enter one yet so here's the deal if
you're sitting in the front couple arose

4
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:58,320
screens and a confident man here to try
to make sure that you're not sitting up

5
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:17,400
front to close and unable to apologize
that today we found everybody say hi

6
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,100
has been helping us and buildings move
on and a lot of other conferences for

7
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,509
many many years beginning to drought
dries from California I think my fondest

8
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,560
had story was when he told me on one of
the trips that he had had cruise control

9
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,030
installed in his car and I was like how
to install that is what I got this stick

10
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,460
see and I cut a notch that says 65 and
75 analyst prominently the dashboard and

11
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:51,039
I awesome that is resourceful I like
that alot a good man can you hear me in

12
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,500
the back

13
00:01:51,500 --> 00:02:03,160
excellent so I'm versus highly organized
this is her her shtick hired gun and

14
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,700
coincidentally also her husband we are
streaming this live two unsub

15
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:16,410
materiality Russian 69 indeed thank you

16
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:24,500
today's gonna go so we don't have any
any anything in a talking about the

17
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:31,670
badges so I just want to clarify a few
things so your badge speaking smelling

18
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,429
good so imagine a bicycle how many
people have broken their bags in some

19
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:43,060
way so far we are designing these
initially house and into hiding in my

20
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,400
kids to try to put together the city
rate was almost a hundred percent so and

21
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,140
that was just putting them together
there's also some confusion the fact

22
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,790
that may be the fourth piece was an epic
troll actually as it turns out justice

23
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,540
pair so if you're trying to figure out
how to make that peg saying that really

24
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,989
giant hole is literally a spare because
we had pegs break like nonstop oh and I

25
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,220
radio on my butt

26
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,750
so anyway

27
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,610
louder so we're gonna go through do look
a bit different than yours

28
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:27,100
wow that's really good that is
outstanding so i mean clearly the ticket

29
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:33,549
sales process and buys two people have
been here before feeding the trolls

30
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,320
early

31
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:41,220
yeah just enter the newbies in the
community if you see like quotes like

32
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,990
conference name is canceled its just an
ongoing joke since like the days of BBS

33
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:50,300
like it is actually in Brighton and like
everyone cancelled alike thats funny

34
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,940
know really how do you prove you know
it's pretty amusing way to keep the same

35
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:02,340
format yes and they have been canceled
before it's here but we're to keep the

36
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,160
same format as you're just to give you a
flavour of what we think about this you

37
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,970
can sit through talks for three days and
it you learn a lot but a couple things

38
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,470
happen one you kind of bored I fall
asleep a lot like I actually think I

39
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,579
have a medical condition and I cannot
stay awake sitting down for more than

40
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,859
about 10 minutes so Friday night for
people like myself we keep talks very

41
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,940
short so the plenary in this room are
races around 20 minutes

42
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,710
like you know jeffords of people off
stage if they run long and they will

43
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,440
finish up with Aquino Saturday we split
up so that you know we've got three

44
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,410
separate tracks and then Sunday three
tracks and we bring the whole thing

45
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,260
together would use this format for a
long time I mean almost since the

46
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,440
beginning to the comments were done
pretty well that said I think one of the

47
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,240
things that we've held in general is
that things are working right now you

48
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,950
should try doing it differently and and
I mean that from the sense of innovation

49
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,820
you can get into iraq you can get into
you know kind of doing the same thing

50
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,580
over and over and feel like you're
making progress maybe that's not the

51
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,169
thing that's needed so we felt out to
review like we're still gonna stick with

52
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,390
this we think one track mind these talks
in general this this format has merit

53
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,669
but again we're always open to feedback
to it or email whatever

54
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:23,540
will be happy to talk about it so what's
wrong

55
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:39,420
Charlie Riedel / last year so what's in
this room bring it on bring it on this

56
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,740
will be over there and bring it on the
other side

57
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:53,680
no no you've got to build it in your
program we weren't watching the live

58
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,170
stream people just go to the website cuz
theres lakes

59
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:04,280
charities are just read the Guardians so
for those for those who don't know we

60
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,690
shook on it we don't try to make money
right we're pretty large conference and

61
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,230
oftentimes people very confused about
that like I have a day job that I do

62
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:21,670
that isn't this study does this
sometimes I get asked people to work on

63
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,760
but how does this but you know she also
raise our kids in this home in and do

64
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,450
lots of other stuff and at the end of
the day you know this is something that

65
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,360
we do for fun and we like to give back
as much of this process to the community

66
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:41,060
as we can for example today it's easier
charities for those of you that haven't

67
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,250
been here before you know you come to
conferences you can buy t-shirts its

68
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,950
fine its needs and the money usually
goes the conference organizers are or

69
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,050
something like that for us

70
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:56,900
you give us we give the conference all
the teachers as a donation then you by

71
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,620
the t-shirts are donated money to the
teacher jerry's $15 token and that's ok

72
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:09,300
you can drop into a bucket for charity

73
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,030
world bicycle relief so you choose where
you want your $15 to go so we don't get

74
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,070
that money goes straight to one of those
three charities so you're actually

75
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,490
donated to charity every time you get a
t-shirt so that's where doubt done this

76
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,529
for a long time is work tomorrow

77
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:30,789
advantage of this is Ben I'm technically
selling nothing in Dec I am giving you

78
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:38,899
the t-shirt yeah anybody been following
the duration for weed brownies a big

79
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:42,779
thing in Dec for those that haven't
there's an organization that this is

80
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:43,519
true

81
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:49,779
has been has weed brownies and if you
donate you will get a weed brownie but

82
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:55,509
they're not selling weed brownies so
everything's a ok it's a big cars like

83
00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:01,069
with all the emblazoned on the side of
it and the weed brownie guy in the

84
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:07,609
corner

85
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:17,519
do that next year with the Colorado and
do it do it we'd for charities and they

86
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,069
don't feel so bad about it

87
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,579
Story 3 o'clock there's other goings on

88
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:27,739
there's a lot of contests Marko germar
Kodak workers they're all you know down

89
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:31,399
the hallway registration and in your
program we don't want to spend a lot of

90
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,000
time talking about that but you know
part of her again if this is your first

91
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,688
time there's a lot of things that
happened inside these rooms with an

92
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:42,889
awful lot that happened down as always
be sure to go check it all out Saturday

93
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:46,579
night party for the third year in a row
we're staying put

94
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:53,599
there's no more gone round ya already
see it's open to anyone over there right

95
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,050
now all ages all ages but there will in
the bar we host should pay more

96
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:07,699
attention to the slides others drink
tickets are $10 at door open bar it's

97
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:13,490
like he's doing much to drink

98
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,089
you know that's a bold statement with
five people right left with several

99
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:22,320
thousand people it's it's a huge think
so but we do have trouble

100
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:34,610
ok you know she's really bad it's just
been hottest years transparency

101
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,440
gonna have three stand-up comics from
our community and the people in the

102
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,150
program their bios and everything

103
00:09:41,150 --> 00:10:01,840
yeah we are having not here and it
stands up doing you know ten-minute

104
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:12,530
Jason Blanchard works for CNN he's the
one with the crazy pictures 7 pictures

105
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:24,420
of him on sales job anyway so he's gonna
do to me that's gonna be followed by our

106
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:32,319
wonderful DJs and keep my Google Reader
hopefully coming

107
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,520
never partied with Keith Myers this is
your opportunity you never party right

108
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:45,100
keith is the Rockstar deejay hacker
right there may be DJing and not sure

109
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:52,020
okay that's got a little bit star-struck
for Keith Keith Jones Lambos and DJs and

110
00:10:52,020 --> 00:11:02,130
hacks things kids are so this is
something we've done now for a while we

111
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,689
got a lot of feedback a few years ago
about hey can you make it easier for

112
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,150
students to come like there needs to be
more our region and to be clear that we

113
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,230
actually have

114
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:22,500
fair participation from the service
academies people from well you know the

115
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,540
quiet

116
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:37,329
more than that yellow line down the
middle so after you know we got some

117
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,830
feedback so they could make it easier to
get students and in the feedback to

118
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:45,730
students is like a it's hard to take it
which is like but also you know it is

119
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,580
expensive rightly DC's not cheaply give
you gonna go to a conference in Omaha

120
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,840
like I presume hotels in Omaha are not
use expensive essential Dec I'm not

121
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:01,140
trying to get these expensive stage is
expensive they're going to be able to

122
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,970
take it every day in an Iranian for like
April I guess I could make it so what we

123
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,000
decided to have the system where people
can basically student which is not

124
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,270
nearly as sexual as it sounds

125
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:27,970
mostly so 18 and over this year it was
ok so they buy their own ticket to buy

126
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,600
the ticket of the attendee and then the
next one hundred bucks on top of that

127
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:41,240
there goes a stipend and $100 we match
that for $200 so

128
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,440
are 30 or both the first year in second
year that we did this we open 25 spots

129
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,360
for students and users and actually met
that both ears but this year we got

130
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:04,830
forty three applications for students
with only 29 and there are a lot of you

131
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:18,430
are if you feel comfortable and want to
be a student on this music so I mean

132
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,449
it's worked out pretty well and I think
it's obviously the feedback has been

133
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,520
positive across the board at some point
we will have to limit weekend just a few

134
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:34,500
years ago or something but you know what
is the continuing to get if you have

135
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,510
ideas on other ways that we can help

136
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:42,069
outreach like that that we agree on
something so for the last two years when

137
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,070
you submitted its hawkish makan we said
hey would you be interested in

138
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,620
contributing to a proceedings and
overwhelming response absolutely so our

139
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:57,230
general feeling is I hate watching
YouTube videos to learn stuff right like

140
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,010
it is painful like there was a great
talk at random conference acts you

141
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,740
should go watch it like no no I'm not
actually not gonna watch it like I won't

142
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,339
I am actually happier not knowing it cuz
I don't want to sit there for an hour

143
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:15,050
and watch people like me yet I can't
can't deal with it so I know it's really

144
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,609
honestly I really struggle with us so
we're like you know there needs to be a

145
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,079
way for now it should be passed along in
a more kind of concrete in conventional

146
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,160
way and so for seniors is a standard
issue a leader a little paper published

147
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,740
and then you can cite it you know citing
YouTube videos is stupid you know like

148
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:41,260
citation new to this world the time so
what we decided to do is

149
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:47,150
hadn't seen it all together and then
these proceedings that takes a lot of

150
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:51,160
work you have to edit it during
everything it all together yet to

151
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,240
actually do the you know publishing it
is my number all that kind of stuff and

152
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,470
it took two years to get it all done but
we got two years done so we got 14 and

153
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:08,580
15 available now online so you can go to
the proceedings and look at your program

154
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:19,850
so 2016 out in like so and and thank you
to all the speakers I know from having

155
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,650
been on the other side of that it can be
a frustrating thing to do that kind of

156
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,250
work in a Nazi your first realize we
appreciate you being kind of part of

157
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,960
that guinea pig process and you have a
baby apologies for taking so long since

158
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:42,970
thank you and we need to think James and
together I don't know in the room

159
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,810
it's like the state of the union to
consider if you stand up while others

160
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:58,399
have used all like to get some stand
behind me before I just come up in bball

161
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:05,459
Ryan what's your name sir Schuyler
Schuyler is now Paul Ryan yet stylish

162
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:15,800
just just put the seat there and kind of
look grumpy

163
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:27,790
to be behind it was a dreary enough dude
you are serious but Biden has a monkey

164
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:39,519
yes I it's called the state of Delaware

165
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:49,040
as as a story

166
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,459
guys doing stand-up lives just across
the river from us and that sounds

167
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:58,550
awfully homie right like you know back
in the prairie and lives across the

168
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,939
river and he was doing stand-up at the
bar downtown soon to go watch to make

169
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,110
sure that we had made a grave error in
inviting him to to to stand up and

170
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:11,059
Jason's dads there and Jason's dad is
built like a proverbial brick shithouse

171
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:16,309
you know tattoos really looks like a
pretty serious dude as this comic gets

172
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:21,040
out the half way through the thing and
he opens up with a trip joke at Jason's

173
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:27,720
dad said they're gonna watch it and this
guy this is a little tiny dude doing

174
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,830
this stand-up act and the rules about
the size of this stage right so it's not

175
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,590
like I'm talking to the big audience and
there's like one guy like this

176
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:38,659
a recent trip this guy's throat out and
so he starts out with the second truck

177
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:44,179
joke clearing incident from Jason's dad
and they just stood there for a second

178
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:47,790
and they just took a left turn words
into action how like I think I just

179
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:57,300
ruined his entire act was gonna tell
jokes dying anyway you have a lot of

180
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:04,570
materials and other people's material so
friendly warnings so please please

181
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:10,470
please be respectful hotels that the
other hotel guests each other up in the

182
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,700
program about in general how we feel
about these things

183
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:21,290
you know people that are here there's a
conference going on here at FLC Monday

184
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,120
so for some of you I hear parking might
have been difficult

185
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,760
yeah some of you may have just sold your
car in connecticut avenue for 20 bucks

186
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:42,170
valet parking and this year you will not
get a parking ticket in the sense that

187
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,130
you get a thing to get out of the garage
and parking ticket that's your own

188
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,840
problem when you leave the garage just
tell them you're stuck on you get the

189
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,199
discount so its varied streamline it
simply don't become registration so you

190
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,250
also have to wear badges at all time
assuming they don't break there are just

191
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,820
to go back to the badges there are
limited

192
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:11,470
replacements extras for reals last

193
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,370
reset enough about that

194
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:21,199
don't break your damn bad jealous I've
got some bubble wrap the you can

195
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,750
carefully place it in a week so they
brought all the pieces back so if you

196
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,870
break the main badge if you bring all
the pieces back so you can't like split

197
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,989
it and spend both houses of the dollars
and stupid shit like that we will we

applause

206
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:50,668
wow you can't watch the stream from the
conference so we don't have my desk on

207
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:53,570

announcements and standings

209
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:31,289
actually community and so for those of
you that didn't know him just a few

210
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:52,489
quick announcements we have a ipod touch
of a registration but we are there and

211
00:21:52,489 --> 00:22:13,770
saturday right after the main talks and
in our year so

212
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:38,970
years and get into ran territory so
here's the deal you know about the

213
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,640
opening we've gone through everything
and you know whatever you walk in rain

214
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:49,250
and everything is your program the
program i think is really first-rate

215
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,260
this year it's really nice got a lot of
great information and so read it what we

216
00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:00,340
want to do is talking more in general
about our philosophy on the content and

217
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,179
some of those came to pass this year
because of the excitement around the

218
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:09,110
round two ticket sales and there was an
awful lot of questions being asked that

219
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:13,010
we've answered in years prior in her own
the contact when we gonna give all the

220
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:17,780
transparency about your financial
assistance and that kind of thing but a

221
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:24,580
front center in Canada's Yukon website
and beyond that just new people in the

222
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,090
community that don't know why we started
work on the way that we filled out to

223
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,209
community in a while we have certain
policies so rather than just put all

224
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:37,290
that and and and and relegated to own
the con we're not talking immaculate

225
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,050
about some of the philosophy issues
about it on the console gonna happen

226
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,389
tomorrow I'll still have all the details
and the numbers and all that if you want

227
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:50,630
to come come for that but for now or
watch it later will be reduced to remote

228
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,750
sites

229
00:23:52,750 --> 00:24:01,550
so this is becoming increasingly rare
animal but we have a video mature policy

230
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:08,600
and we tried to the reasons that we have
it and we've held onto it in the face of

231
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,649
other conferences frankly dropping the
their policies is that in the face of

232
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:31,620
ubiquitous cameras everywhere is gonna
smartphone camera hidden ones given up a

233
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:38,239
lot of our personal privacy as societies
of all right and and I think that I've

234
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:48,920
struggled without a lot and what ages
but at the same token we've kept a lot

235
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,370
of those social issues outside these
walls in this conference has been

236
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,760
focused on a lot of technology issues
you know if you wanted to beat some of

237
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,250
the finer points around privacy or you
know whatever there's other events you

238
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,470
can go to discuss that we've kept that
kind of that length but that said we

239
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,340
held a pretty hard line around things
about trying to protect your personal

240
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:13,770
privacy as best we can win your ex ear
so even as those concepts involved even

241
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,570
as we become more accepting of
everything being recorded and we're in

242
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,790
every database and all that kind of
stuff it doesn't mean that you have to

243
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:24,100
go quietly ended at so one of our
general tenants is we do we tend to

244
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,320
protect your privacy but then it's also
want you to do what you can to protect

245
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,730
yourself right

246
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,850
privacy is a two way street and you
should hold people accountable to

247
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,620
protect it we also need to look out for
yourself so you know to that end we had

248
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,280
a picture policy that's quite simple if
you take a picture

249
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,860
everyone in the frame needs to agree to
have their picture taken I assure you

250
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,979
many shots of the stage for the audience
not everybody agrees so we gonna live

251
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,670
picture taking in these rooms at all
except for our official photog who know

252
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,820
the drill so we've got

253
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,560
Carson and then dan is somewhere so
there were counted out shirts they have

254
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,190
giant lenses but they still follow the
same rules and they may periodically

255
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,710
snap a photo that you know has people
out of frame and then even the leader

256
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,810
and is out or whatever their targets it
and we've reached that Menino kind of

257
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:18,679
what we expect so we're going to
continue to hold this policy may be odd

258
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,500
may be different for you please respect
it we will try to enforce it received

259
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,370
lots of photos to stop if you can't stop
and ask you to leave so that complicated

260
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:39,189
has been saved your FB like that they're
not gonna like the rest of this ticket

261
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:48,030
sales so we limit ticket sales notice so
it gives the con manageable for everyone

262
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,160
like we would not even joking like
there's limits to what we can do

263
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,350
ourselves as individuals with like jobs
in garages and shit do you know how many

264
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,310
pallets will fit in my garage right now

265
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:07,840
66 fell to stop it sits outside a minor
stuff getting wet and and and that's

266
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,550
just the garage like by three days
before the con our house is amazed when

267
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,090
you walk in the door in your met with
like you've entered north

268
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,699
no go east ok in its attacks adventure
just to get to the dining room so Jason

269
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:28,370
Scott should have been in here that was
really but it's also not manageable for

270
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,399
you when it gets really large you got a
really large commercial event you don't

271
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,740
see the people you want to see you don't
get to see the content you know you know

272
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:40,730
you get lost around by people around you
I don't enjoy that and a lot of people

273
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:46,410
struggle with social and other issues
and want to be on public you know these

274
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:53,660
big event it's hard to get motivated to
go out and and we want to keep it this I

275
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,730
think we're happy with this size in
general I think the people that make it

276
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:05,080
in her happy with the size if you don't
make it in our effort and energy and

277
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,899
money in time industry me this is people
can learn and I get the you don't get

278
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,210
home

279
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,070
time you get to interact with all the
vendors here when we still feel it's

280
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:19,439
pretty important to limit the size we
sell the tickets are cells right we run

281
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,710
the ticketing software re-run the new
landing page thing we clear the

282
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,840
transactions we have a merchant account
all that kind of stuff we do it

283
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,158
ourselves and there was an awful lot of
pushback this year just use Eventbrite

284
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:43,390
or just use whatever manner that's out
there and other companies I just got

285
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:51,419
turned it when you call those companies
and you get interesting answers

286
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:57,350
epic

287
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:02,529
people I we've never seen that before my
i want that to be the unique unicorn and

288
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:09,110
you're right we we did talk with them
and they were willing to work with us

289
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,090
like hey you know we're so gonna keep
track of these people what we can we

290
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,870
cannot market to them you know so you
won't get span about like like events

291
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,969
and things like that

292
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:24,710
well so we were doing that right as we
were basically up against the wall on

293
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:31,770
ticket sales for ticket sales in the
nursing thing we ran errands for years

294
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:41,590
that was our website and it was written
by here wrote it it was he wrote a full

295
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,408
blown CMS so god speed little doodle
that was awesome if you're able to pull

296
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:50,190
that off but you can apply but wait for
the punchline this little

297
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,320
characteristics like sometimes when you
would edit the page and you would hit

298
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,059
enter in the wrong field it would save
and delete the page and we were done

299
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:05,860
archive.org to recover the page it's
funny now but I wasn't funny at the time

300
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:11,209
this happened you know and then like
Heidi would be trying to post the links

301
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:16,320
for the the sales process to the web
page and hit submit to be logged out

302
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,450
like everyone's like it's noon it's
known like where's my legacy

303
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:27,590
soon you know people are so mean to you

304
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:37,679
not use you so but the thing is it was
wicked fast right because we get like

305
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,520
three thousand requests the second at
the peak of this thing when people are

306
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:47,620
coming like where's my leg and he wrote
idea what we're doing a pretty beefy box

307
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:54,929
area we we tested that for you you get
like 200 hundred and tenth connections

308
00:30:54,930 --> 00:31:02,620
are second on a wordpress site before
all the hell over let's do in gross so

309
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:08,159
in the first round we used actually
wordpress.com remove the whole CMS we

310
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,900
still had her own back-end systems to
sell it seconds and we moved up to

311
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,470
wordpress.com you just use WordPress
like we don't need to maintain the

312
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,560
WordPress installation cos there's a lot
of WordPress vulnerabilities not sure if

313
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,320
you've noticed that and it's a pain in
the butt to lie deuces in this region on

314
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,300
things are constantly and we only need
periodically so we went to wordpress.com

315
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:33,360
and they handle the load a big problem
its ads they have legacy analyst in

316
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,979
front of everything and we had people
that we hit publish and I saw the link

317
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,180
and how you saw the other person didn't
see the link and other person in Seal

318
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,290
Inc they would start a new browser
that's a private session in ceiling for

319
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:49,060
two minutes two and a half minutes
before it popped up again I D based

320
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,500
thing like I'm no idea what the
discriminator was when you start a fresh

321
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:59,690
reboot the box nope still wow so we felt
pretty bad I mean that's it allows

322
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,820
experience for you all and it causes
churn in its not good so we're like we

323
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,429
can't do that WordPress clearly isn't a
change their CD and they didn't even

324
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,790
have like voice support you give them
money and you get the email them and

325
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:15,129
that's it so I am I gonna have an email
dialogue

326
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,480
hosted WordPress provider and I said
look we're going to see like I don't

327
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,820
know several thousand connections second
can you handle this

328
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:38,070
past and we ended up actually started a
violent restart phone out and what was

329
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:43,320
interesting for WP engine company tells
them now and they were super responsive

330
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:50,510
to repair a we've never seen anything
like this before but they immediately

331
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,110
put us on a vigorous dislike within five
minutes but five minutes to law

332
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,750
enforcement on ticket sales right cuz
we're all really everybody's freaking

333
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:02,450
out yeah so we're like forget it you
know will back off and will test this

334
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:06,000
and so they have a much larger instances
actually three servers a whole CD in

335
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,620
front of that would reverse proxy front
of that and it was kind of interesting

336
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:16,219
because we crowdsource a couple of and
they're like we've never seen anyone

337
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,380
crowds or select test before I'm like
well you could go on IRC if you want

338
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:29,880
like that's a that's a good way to make
it happen so we are as this load test

339
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,560
and it pushed over this bigger instance
and this is only maybe about a quarter

340
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:40,700
of the normal traffic that we would see
on registration days now some of you had

341
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,520
figured out how to get past the the
proxy and from the web server 80 the

342
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,710
proxies not going to serve dynamic
content so people just aren't any

343
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:51,810
inquiries to the page that the servers
going to ignore what the process is

344
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,960
gonna be like I don't know if this thing
is a must go to work at the origin

345
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:02,220
server so I one dude sent like three
hundred and preserve the origin servers

346
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:11,170
that's awesome yeah so we we decided you
know we we we had kind of a sit down

347
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:16,909
like ok sources or not and we came back
to the whole thing like if we outsource

348
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:21,389
this we're basically selling your dated
somebody else right like you know when

349
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,870
we get done with us we don't we don't
know who you are when you show up we

350
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:27,310
don't really wanna know who you are when
you pay and a half to four like refunds

351
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:34,049
and things like that sort of like
accepting Bitcoin or something you know

352
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,990
there's really no way for us to
completely

353
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:40,189
but we we try to be as honest as
possible in this process that we pay

354
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:48,230
money to do this is going to be our
selves static landing page in a WSN m4

355
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,250
extra large by the way to handle this

356
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:56,830
give you an idea of yeah we brought in
outside town which servers which sounds

357
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:03,740
pretty geeky and so we are reloads
accidentally ran fine it was just an

358
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,200
occasional page and then for extra large
running engine X that we just manually

359
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,450
move go here for the next page when
people when the thing we live so that's

360
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:15,350
as complicated as it got and then we
went back into the system that works

361
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:25,250
just as well ya know so we have some
requirements wanna make sure your

362
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,140
privacy when minimize costs like we
could have made WordPress work we would

363
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:34,230
spend $10,000 doing the ethnic moves
cluster remember the Moose cluster yeah

364
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:39,080
it was like seven desktops that we like
literally hammered into Iraq with a

365
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,340
couple of servers on hundreds of hours
of labor

366
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,500
whatsoever be favoring one group or
another and that people with faster

367
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,380
Internet connections are more credit
cards or double digits kryptonite script

368
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:56,220
and that Canada and and so we there's a
bunch of things that we do like we

369
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,959
seriously review every single round
manually before we let people pay for

370
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,070
their tickets right it's this two-step
process you get your code you come back

371
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,260
in an hour hour and a half you pay for
it you know it's happy between that time

372
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,840
we're looking at the logs we look at
everything trying to figure out my IP

373
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,770
address by email but whatever criteria
we can look a user-agent whatever

374
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:23,380
doesn't look like there's a nanny and we
could call him in a bottom mood four

375
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,340
thousand living human beings hitting
like this is not a bot this is a rich

376
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:36,330
and there are bodies in there are little
things closing down so you know we feel

377
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,779
like we're trying to be good stewards of
this process and we spend time and

378
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,500
energy reconstructing what happened we
look at alternate systems like a lottery

379
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,550
games like just

380
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,560
lottery randomly ok well how do you buy
tickets

381
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,220
what would constitute an email address

382
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:59,049
let's write a script as you can make the
most email address in the next hour by

383
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:03,480
ticket for a box ok couple things one
that bias toward people that have money

384
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,730
lots of credit card whenever this track
with credit cards paid with credit cards

385
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:14,110
to students and people like that can be
done to put that game and also card

386
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:18,720
processors especially when in our model
we really sell tickets like three days a

387
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,589
year

388
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:23,390
get really grumpy about lots of little
microtransactions Republic change

389
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,910
because they are you doing all these
weird things I don't like it and got

390
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:30,339
thrown off one card processor this year
and it was because we did too bad

391
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,830
they're just like we don't do single
day's racing weekend kind of events

392
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:33,470
anymore

393
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,569
will do reoccurring thing but we're not
doing events like this so we had to go

394
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:41,840
to a different it's a pain in the butt
to get your accounts along the back end

395
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:50,330
banks are kinda crap so tell us they
they had sent an email like back in June

396
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,620
it went to spam

397
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,859
we never saw it and we tried to like do
test runs in october is just what we

398
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,980
sent you an email Mike if we were normal
business I'll be suing your ass

399
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:06,790
credit cards today here's an email
though everything we also had people say

400
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,850
like rights of first refusal I came in
your spouse should be able to come again

401
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:17,210
so we wouldn't have this is like a third
of the audience has been here one time

402
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,790
so you know

403
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:24,440
accused of being a lot already as it
stands so that would make it actually

404
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,840
even worse because I like three or four
percent of the hands up instead of

405
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:34,460
thirty or forty percent so even a
technical level the system that we've

406
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,110
built when you look at the operating
system how to configure the webserver

407
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:42,300
the whole deal people buying overseas
from cell phones ok people like a really

408
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,580
fast connection with its a 500 gained
like literally like it that packing in

409
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:52,940
so many of you there to get the ticket
before you on your connection it's a god

410
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,680
damn buy thoughts and single sled right
like unless you doing some wacky

411
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,779
violation thing and that is epic and
I'll hire you for that shit you should

412
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,610
probably to settle down and just
realized that you were not in line and

413
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:13,530
so are open to ideas were open to
different suggestions but be aware like

414
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:17,080
our criteria here is keep it fair we
don't want to keep students out we don't

415
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,110
want to keep people that you know maybe
can't afford it but you know they're

416
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,920
going to straighten it together and make
it work

417
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:30,230
non technologists you know even worse
makan labs or even though you know we

418
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,750
asked the students and tell us about
yourself and the idea is not to get you

419
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,810
pick the best InfoSec majors it's just
show that you're motivated you like I'm

420
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:43,180
philosophy major I think this is
fascinating cool come learn never taken

421
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,960
in class like come learn hands-on like
that's way more important than me like

422
00:39:46,960 --> 00:40:06,110
god-given right now that's not how this
shit works hard and every one of your

423
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:17,670
texts Oxnard I'm gonna talk selection
process in no particular order we do

424
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,810
have bias in talks election and that's
on purpose we want talks that are not

425
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,038
offensive

426
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:36,259
it's actually you can go to like that's
great and there's a lot of room for that

427
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:41,640
we want to try to focus on defensive
issues want to focus on new ways of

428
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:47,650
thinking about heart problems there are
still talks in schedule right there

429
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:52,809
aren't any but we definitely are are
looking for talks that helped push hard

430
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:57,459
on defense and awareness in risk in that
kind of thing and so we will bias away

431
00:40:57,459 --> 00:41:02,839
from you by stored first time speakers
to say everybody the first time but when

432
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:06,199
you look at it when people say I've
never spoken at a conference have never

433
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:09,380
spoken at a security conference in the
people who are crossing over like a

434
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,219
developer but now in the security
company and learned a lot to come speak

435
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:18,619
great that factors in cool release
something you know actually that you can

436
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:23,150
holder do something with that's useful
as a person who can't write code I have

437
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:27,299
a lot of respect for that always amazed
that people come up to my talks were all

438
00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:30,239
I'm doing is saying shit and I'm not
actually providing

439
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,880
because it's harder to get a takeaway
from someone who just talking and

440
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,589
something they can actually sleep code
or provide some new framework that helps

441
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:44,109
you out and also those of all directions
as it turns out things like smell smoke

442
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:49,650
on correctly as part of the directions
my favorite peoples are ready in asking

443
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:54,049
for tickets or press passes whatever
they spelled wrongly no you don't get it

444
00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:58,449
but it turns out this is an important
characteristic and we don't do it well

445
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:03,969
sometimes we hold people accountable if
you get the form correctly the

446
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:14,419
acceptance rate was I think about 16% so
there was a lot like 220 X thirty-three

447
00:42:14,419 --> 00:42:20,038
got accepted its right and people like
all the good talks about rejected what

448
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:24,019
what you really think that's what the
committee like a whole group of random

449
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:29,729
people get together include you know it
it turns out collusion is hard right it

450
00:42:29,729 --> 00:42:34,519
really is like you can elected class
president without people crying right

451
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:37,450
and let alone like you know you try to

452
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:46,540
so they're honest feedback and then we
compose it together and pick the program

453
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:51,810
so you know good toxin may get a means
it probably great talks did and we take

454
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:56,000
risks committee will take risks and some
talks it's the best thing to do for the

455
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:06,740
conference and for the community meeting
the balance for talks on a topic that we

456
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:10,970
can 45 so we will add one or two on that
topic so it's it's really the compose

457
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:16,520
program for the whole conference
sponsors we have a limit sponsors you

458
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,240
think it's a hard thing trying to be
attending a college may be a sponsor of

459
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,979
the conference sponsorship is just like
being in 10 D it's absolutely right

460
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:37,020
there's no first rights there's nothing
like that by the end of the month

461
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:42,819
earlier than any other year other people
in we don't let weightless DUI on the

462
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:48,660
website in August were open and there so
if you're thinking about sponsoring or

463
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,598
whatever just be aware like you know the
website for updates on Twitter and will

464
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,300
announce it but we really want
sponsorship to be a two-way street right

465
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:02,990
you know you see sponsor's out there
it's not like who's been raising our

466
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:07,229
savings ratio there's big blues and
whites and will kinds of fun stuff that

467
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,450
doesn't happen out there right now with
the sponsors three inches away from each

468
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,098
other

469
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:14,640
be like do something cool with a six
foot table and the fact that you're

470
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,328
pressed up against the wall don't end
there as the challenge and we certainly

471
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:24,730
have first your sponsors who get
confused like we had was the recruiting

472
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,710
firm showed up when you're in suits

473
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:32,290
know it was like those are gonna county
or something it was and they showed up

474
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,920
in suits and they were like standing
here on Friday like all huddled together

475
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:43,150
like they got the picture but led me to
a street because we poo-poo vendors and

476
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,130
yellow diamond all that kind of stuff at
the end of day like this is all part of

477
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,650
the industry that we're in and we have
to find a way to live together and work

478
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,700
together and make the most of us are
employed

479
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:58,069
instrument negative unemployment so I
believe most of the rooms and into a

480
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:02,140
week we try to get the sponsors engage
in hooked up in and doing useful stuff

481
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:10,339
self again we treat responses just like
he's great and you're not you lose dress

482
00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:16,109
to impress so we don't accept all friend
requests we are incredibly selective

483
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:21,150
toward what press we allow and what's
interesting is i think we've got two

484
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:27,400
more inches from press this year than in
years past and last year was last year

485
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,760
than the year prior to that we biased
toward people who understand the

486
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,750
industry and reporting I would even hand
as important as it turns out there's a

487
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:39,430
lot of opportunity for mud in InfoSec
reporting I don't know if you've noticed

488
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:46,049
but the power ted koppel said the power
to go down today so I've got my zombie

489
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:56,230
kid girls that was my that was my
squirrel limitation

490
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:08,540
hi I'm sorry there's any other way to
get to that part of the show and we also

491
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,180
those people who are motivated and and
want to break into this face everything

492
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,339
had that kind of mindset that can report

493
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,000
well for a long time we didn't allow
president and then we kind of had this

494
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,500
epiphany like like that's actually not
doing the best for me because there's

495
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,160
lots of good things said here has good
ideas

496
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:29,379
presentations people the hallway that I
think can help frame the state of the

497
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:36,020
union as it in a way that they should be
concerned about what they should and

498
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,970
having the press as a productive
dialogue that is important and that's

499
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:46,290
why we started allowing pressing but
that's why we also then we we don't

500
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:51,109
generally do bias against those who are
looking for a story what's going on with

501
00:46:51,109 --> 00:47:06,240
a good story line and we bias against
really big media and its control the

502
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:12,330
message but to be honest every
interactive the press in this kind of

503
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:17,359
environment it hasn't gone all that well
for me and I'm not even that big of a

504
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:24,660
deck so my favorite was when I was a
Booz Allen for a while

505
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:33,759
company but I did not actually on my
waist and working again talking like at

506
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,020
one of the years I was working there and
I was about some nonsense and I said we

507
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:42,440
have an accomplice to god damn thing the
last forty years which in the stream of

508
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,530
expletives coming out of my mouth that
was actually pretty toned down the Booz

509
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,140
Allen PR has a clipping service and
services now is the common thing an

510
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,580
industry that they look for instances of
their name and then they find the words

511
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,369
on both sides of in they send it to PR
people say what people are saying about

512
00:47:57,369 --> 00:47:58,640
your company

513
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,759
well said we haven't accomplished got
there

514
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,349
whose Allen Hamilton

515
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:12,210
landed from Vegas and I got this dance
agreements like please refrain from

516
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:15,460
swearing to publicly to give
presentations while I drop the F bomb

517
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:32,900
plot that one should have an attempt to
god damn fucking independent media

518
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:41,430
I don't work for myself anyway so at the
end of the day though we do think

519
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:46,038
housing engagement and even when its
hard conversations very important and

520
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:48,930
that's what we're trying to facilitate
says it's not all wine and roses and

521
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:51,538
we're not all doing the right thing and
there are a lot of problems and people

522
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:55,549
should be concerned about certain things
but we don't need it for us working to

523
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:58,109
stir up the public and caused a lot of
problems you like the president be

524
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:05,220
process because I get calls from people
who are honestly concerned about the

525
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:10,049
absolute wrong things right white people
are trying to break into my car I feel

526
00:49:10,049 --> 00:49:13,769
it point to the side of the road I think
it's my ex-husband exact exact seen

527
00:49:13,769 --> 00:49:17,779
these carjackings stories like I think
your car is out of alignment actually

528
00:49:17,779 --> 00:49:24,150
Occam's razor cuts toward that right now
unless your husband Charlie Miller and

529
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:34,460
dots and you're trying to kill anyone I
am faced with that one

530
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:43,299
labs so we had early on with the
conference as well as we do training is

531
00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:48,630
going to be training ahead of the
conference and the problem lies again we

532
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,619
were charged at the time

533
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:50,980
1500 bucks

534
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:55,550
for the conference on the low end and it
was hard to reconcile based you grant to

535
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,640
come into training and it hit 50 bucks
stick around for three days in the

536
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,569
conference and trainers don't like doing
stuff for free necessarily especially

537
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:08,450
really good training and we get hands-on
experience and what we end up coming up

538
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:14,618
with a long time ago and we've been
doing it to this day is lab so the idea

539
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:19,280
of the labs is that they're retakes they
are technology from vendors who donate

540
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,740
machines boxes software whatever and we
try to stand up an enterprise-grade like

541
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,850
not screwing around network that has all
intrusion detection and visualization

542
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:33,109
control all that kind of stuff in 36
hours and there are people who are not

543
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:36,670
screwing around experts in the field
doing this but then you apply to become

544
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:40,000
a party lines and then you're like a
mentee working on anything to learn

545
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,030
later to networking wireless ideas
whenever the thing is and you get to

546
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,740
play with all these big mentor tools you
get to learn from people that have been

547
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:51,759
the field three years and we charge 50
bucks mostly as a showing up as he may

548
00:50:51,760 --> 00:51:01,600
get free trade shows so you know we get
t-shirts and things like that and it's

549
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,779
been a great success in the hall you
going to labs you can talk to people in

550
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,450
a very open they're all very excited
about what they're learning to talk to

551
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:13,859
you about it some of the things we try
work sometimes they don't but in general

552
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:17,950
I think our wireless network is pretty
awesome like there's aP's breaking

553
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:22,430
everywhere they get wireless connection
all the vendors all kinds and it's

554
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:26,290
worked out really well and and we try to
be again as open as we can about this

555
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:29,720
cuz it we think it's a good model to
learn from and we hope to be able to

556
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,959
carry you

557
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:40,350
a few other points and now it is then up
is it has been like an hour so on the

558
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:45,270
con- this is really our first attempt to
transparency we've been doing this every

559
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:49,880
year we provide financial information
and sending information demographic

560
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:58,730
talks you know what type of talk was our
internal processes he you know

561
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:02,500
everything about the conference that we
think might be of utilities you to know

562
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,710
about as an attending as a potential
organizer as someone who's in the space

563
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:10,080
to build trust in what we're doing
because I mean honestly there are things

564
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,100
that we've done that haven't gone well
if you notice we got some hiccups but

565
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:18,500
there's a lot of faith from the
community and I think in in no small

566
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,350
part because we're very transparent
about what we do you know there's limits

567
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:31,620
like passwords but down on that
challenge we do provide much information

568
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:35,000
as we can so that you can make a
decision

569
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,420
are we doing the right thing for you and
we'll take anything back you have on

570
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:52,860
both fronts because we about this that's
why we do it it's not because it's my

571
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:56,710
God why do we do this you know and it's
like a million bucks house thousand

572
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:01,980
people people putting recycling in the
trash trash recycling cats and dogs in

573
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:06,730
her breeding no clue what's going on and
then you come here and we go Monday like

574
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:13,490
shit you know one of these 12 in the
summer if you want to know more than we

575
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:18,649
provide here and just ask whatever we
can go around if you haven't been

576
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:26,060
starting conferences and talk with them
for hours and hours of it works so that

577
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:33,210
you can learn from creeping creeping

578
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,320
mr Ryan how are you

579
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:52,740
know what my god I lost track is to be
bye bye bye

580
00:53:52,740 --> 00:54:06,640
ok last thing I'm gonna say on this
general rants this move all this is like

581
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:19,879
the importance of life so we're at I
think black at or near the time and I

582
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:36,800
sit around and they're saying lies and
every once in macular that got the

583
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,910
republican motivated as making a point
about agriculture

584
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:54,589
anyway so it's coming up soon as base
there in and nobody's called none of us

585
00:54:54,590 --> 00:55:00,480
tonight there were like hey that's just
wrong right we can run it better than

586
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:11,190
this and we started we started planning
for the conference to be different

587
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:17,110
engagement and tried to pull the
speakers accountable offenders

588
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:22,800
accountable detainees accountable let's
actually have honest discourse right we

589
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,780
can have discussions that aren't flame
wars right you can disagree with people

590
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:29,900
and not hate them I don't know if you've
noticed but the interest kind of maybe

591
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:38,160
turn that concept down a little bit
concerned about you and so and so we

592
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:46,740
decided to do it this year

593
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,879
microphones up and ask questions

594
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,540
things happen 12 people really good
ideas sometimes it's going to get up and

595
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,960
be that person and if you don't want to
be that person to person that doesn't

596
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,950
have a good ideas but god damn do they
need to hear themselves talk

597
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:08,470
excuse me I'm a follow-up question could
stop not gonna ask even had a microphone

598
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:12,980
X and then use wanna kill the guy in the
next guy is it's the same as his twin

599
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:20,790
right like this idea like a given some
the speaker and so we came up with these

600
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:28,119
species from ball's why not so the thing
in your bag is not just a stress ball is

601
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:31,650
literally it's a it's a way of
facilitating this course if you disagree

602
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:39,150
with the speaker throw the ball at the
person but be aware actually biggest

603
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:42,930
thing for first loss can hurt and there
was the great small launcher incident

604
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:49,549
light 2008 that's a thing really do need
like a pneumatic small engine I got tax

605
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:54,780
rate that left a bruise like I mean it's
a lot of kinetic energy we use that

606
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,970
somebody was it now this raffle items
came out there is an iPhone app that

607
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:02,220
lets me do something and so some guy got
down the floor and people were throwing

608
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:06,830
balls past the iPhone and I was like 35
45 miles

609
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:11,000
ok fire up the cannon and so the guy
gets down there and he's filming stand

610
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,890
up there like 20 feet away but there's
no way he's gonna hit me so I'm just

611
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:19,720
like and it was like who's the dude from
James Bond flick is like an invincible

612
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:26,859
and in the thing shot in the chest hurt
and the iPhone said two hundred-plus

613
00:57:26,859 --> 00:57:29,560
miles an hour

614
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,799
holy God

615
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:41,370
anyway I would encourage you when you
throw them in the biggest thing to be

616
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,970
concerned about a large glasses and
stuff like that

617
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:52,779
them you know make a point channel oh
here we are at the Hyatt the only saving

618
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:57,520
grace is that is the chandelier had so
many pieces in 2013 he could lead how

619
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:03,170
and no one of the best part about that
is the broken no one looked up

620
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:11,750
immediately so we don't throw t-shirts
are closing anymore so you can't have

621
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:18,900
nice things here we just had solid
series and bringing my grandmother's

622
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:29,760
good chandelier next year I'm gonna
start to wrap it up

623
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:41,600
final party so without that's the
philosophy in a nutshell I think in

624
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:46,110
general it's not what we can do every
year to you should hear this until

625
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:49,850
others like shimon styles have to repeat
this a bunch or you know what you go to

626
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:59,259
youtube and watch the video thing so we
hosted her own videos for years even

627
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,880
when I can with words like mucho
expenses Internet Archive has been

628
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:13,480
wonderful video stores now bandwidth and
makes any money so they do not have

629
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:19,130
Internet Archive mostly neither the end
of the day we think the Internet Archive

630
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,609
yeah Internet Archive

631
00:59:21,609 --> 00:59:36,558
is the best place that we can host your
data and it did get a little more

632
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:41,039
political than I intended to the
senators on stage I do in 20 minutes I'm

633
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:45,769
not gonna take 20 minutes but we really
want to be able to tell this story about

634
00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:50,450
what we think about UConn and partially
due to the changes in the industry

635
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:51,598
larger

636
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,140
I wasn't joking there's a negative
unemployment in this industry like there

637
00:59:55,140 --> 01:00:03,529
if you have any fire waller's on your
resume job i've interviewed people that

638
01:00:03,529 --> 01:00:07,680
I think we're confident the least and
they would take me three weeks later got

639
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:21,879
a job in the majors oxide so as
industries pours into it you know it's

640
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,009
not that we can relive the past is not
like we can go backwards and have it the

641
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:28,680
way it used to be my contention is
always been be aware of what we're

642
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,799
losing when things change and be aware
of the impact it has on the community

643
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:37,739
and to me the reason I do this and have
done it for her twenty years now is I

644
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:42,950
feel very passionate about making the
end user or secure

645
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:51,078
users are done you should check your
mail I wanna buy a fancy thermostat on a

646
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:56,029
drive their fancy car and its want to
work right and don't know that there's

647
01:00:56,029 --> 01:01:00,009
things I shouldn't you shouldn't have to
know when the daily users should be as

648
01:01:00,009 --> 01:01:03,910
dumb as you want them to be years
they're able to be God made them and

649
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,569
they should still be able to use things
securely

650
01:01:07,569 --> 01:01:17,538
game news I think that we are moving
away from industry from that concept

651
01:01:17,539 --> 01:01:21,559
right has more money is poured into this
is there's more players involved as more

652
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:28,539
international regulations coming to bear

653
01:01:28,539 --> 01:01:31,979
it's getting to be a very complicated
space and we're getting farther and

654
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:36,439
farther away from when i think is
building systems that users can use

655
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,199
nearly preserving your privacy

656
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:44,900
characteristics about right and and I
want us to be aware of those things and

657
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:50,160
and so I think that maybe a little old
school but we do that with a purpose

658
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,368
because we feel that some of that being
lost as important at least a three day

659
01:01:54,369 --> 01:01:56,989
time period that we remember what it's
like

660
01:01:56,989 --> 01:02:01,880
so that when we go to our jobs maybe do
things a bit differently so anyway that

661
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,799
welcomes new Khan will take off the next
20 minutes
