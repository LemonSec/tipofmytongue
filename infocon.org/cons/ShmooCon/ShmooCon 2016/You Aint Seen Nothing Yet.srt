1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
on our panelists today are marked him
who is the director of government

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:15,519
affairs at hacker on the engines are
also who is the CEO of hyperplane Geoff

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,730
Marsh who is the founder of DEFCON and
is now part of GHS so he just come to us

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,039
slightly schizophrenic because he's got
two hats to wear a hacker hat and the

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,949
government hats and Randy Wheeler who is
where are you

6
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,430
director of the I T controls division at
the you s Department of Commerce she's

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,059
been there for thirty years so she knows
all of the inside dirt so we should

8
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:46,050
train her of all the information she has
an armada greater today is great Conte

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,709
who has been a sticker here many times
I'm sure you've heard some of this

10
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,670
fabulous talks and he is still a
professor at west point as well as many

11
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,160
other things so let's get them there

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:08,590
the stage and see what we can learn

13
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,820
so thanks for coming and welcome to you
ain't seen nothing yet

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,130
new paradigms for policy regulation and
community engagement everyone's been

15
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:25,829
introduced I will in absentia mention
much had it was suppose to moderate this

16
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:30,869
study had a conflict at the last minute
to get out of there we've included him

17
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:41,509
and the rest of loft in their famous
1994 get started can talk about

18
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:49,750
government without a disclaimer and so I
think it's important to emphasize that

19
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:55,390
everyone's views expressed on this panel
or their own they don't reflect the

20
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:09,098
employers or their governments so why
this policy makers and with the stroke

21
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:24,828
of a pen that can make parts do all they
can help our policy-making and

22
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:31,720
legislative are incredible incredibly
powerful unfortunately that isn't always

23
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,970
the case

24
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:46,780
expanding stories that would never made
the front page in the past are now for

25
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:55,090
use in there's legislation percolating

26
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:14,870
exploits so given how should security
gauge how should government engaged

27
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:25,670
acknowledging that you know there are no
card-carrying members information

28
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:34,529
security but how should those too
loosely defined missions there are many

29
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,629
potential pitfalls that the army today
has tremendous experience in the space

30
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:51,828
in your gym think sums it up best every
speaker every writer every practitioner

31
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:57,030
in the field of cyber security his wish
that this topic in us with it seriously

32
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,410
has gotten there were we in the
cybersecurity this you've never been

33
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:10,139
working for foreign policy you eat see
nothing sometimes so with that I'd like

34
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,900
to go down 32 analyst and ask them to
provide brief introductory remarks

35
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:22,130
answering the question what am i doing
and why I like Who Am I what am i doing

36
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:33,800
so I'm just what am i doing so in this
context I found I was acting sort of

37
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,540
-ism facilitator running around trying
to make connections raise awareness and

38
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:48,040
Sandy alluded to it a little bit I'm
Advisory Council for DHS Secretary DHS

39
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,420
in so because of that you end up getting
status call the special government

40
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,950
employees so I'm in SGE which means I'm
a government employee but they don't do

41
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:03,550
so so I only get my expenses covered if
I'm actually added the HSE advisor

42
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,370
otherwise it's all free labor but
because of that you get other things

43
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,500
like a clearance and you get to talk to
anybody want to pretty much in so pretty

44
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,280
soon you end up talking to your
interested in the subject so you go and

45
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,619
you talk to people to find out what's
going on and then you quickly realize

46
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,240
that what you learn you can't really
tell your friends so you've just sort of

47
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,730
self-limited your usefulness because
you'll see people in the community

48
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,780
debating something and you probably you
might know what's really going on or

49
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,489
close to what's going on and you can't
really tell them in so it's been really

50
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,120
eliminating has now from my personal
invitations I called this is how the

51
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,990
sausage is made right this is how its
and this is probably what's gonna happen

52
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,460
down the road but I can't really say
that it becomes really frustrated so

53
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,370
when people say well if you get involved
you need to get close to the problem if

54
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,970
you're not helping your part of the
problem so here I am trying to help it

55
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,680
turns out it somewhat limiting sometimes
it sold

56
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,199
I'm just working my way through that
problem and then was the third question

57
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:16,370
why are you doing why am i doing I've
got nothing better to do

58
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,630
wheeler and the director of the
information technology controls division

59
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,590
and the Bureau of Industry and security
at the Department of Commerce my

60
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:32,909
Division is responsible for export
licensing computers communications and

61
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,800
information security products that are
controlled on the Commerce control list

62
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,280
as part of the expert Administration
regulations we work with departments of

63
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,638
Defense state homeland security code on
developing the regulations the licensing

64
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:55,220
requirements for the commodities
software and technology that are subject

65
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,780
to license requirement in within the
department defense because the

66
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,580
information security encryption they
were particularly closely with the

67
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:10,859
National Security Agency we do develop
the regulations and we also implement

68
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,250
those regulations by issuing processing
in issuing licenses and most of what we

69
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,919
do

70
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:24,570
be surprised in a division is in the
information security encryption and most

71
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,479
recently we've been dealing with the
rulemaking intrusions upgrade it was

72
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,758
agreed at the range as an arrangement is
a multilateral organizations they had

73
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:40,639
establishes a common control list of
forty one member countries and we

74
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,270
implement those as national security
controls on her colors control is and in

75
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:53,349
particular the proposed rulemaking since
even before the rulemaking published a

76
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,750
proposed rule is published last me

77
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:04,020
education opportunities for me we don't
usually do proposed rulemaking we don't

78
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:11,070
usually do which form are not a formal
rulemaking process it's actually called

79
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:18,120
an informal rulemaking process where we
request public comment in the address

80
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,800
those coming in the next version of the
rule in eventually perhaps that the

81
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:33,659
final and it has been very large
learning experience for me in the last

82
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:54,569
year as we try to bring export controls
into the twenty percent real translation

83
00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:21,490
service between exports and you don't
know whether you are attempting to

84
00:09:21,490 --> 00:10:59,720
people like

85
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:18,709
so addicted to stop with the questions
of what is the current state the

86
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:26,479
relationship and security government
general but in the context of the

87
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:37,000
relationship to use tax policy which way
is it true also something but you take

88
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,379
something my list of notes gonna brings
up later so I what I've realized what

89
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:50,370
I've observed this policy people that
are trying to get smart on cyber and

90
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,569
they're desperate for how to do that I
realized we don't offer them any really

91
00:11:55,569 --> 00:12:00,620
good so they're trying to dance classes
are trying to watch things on YouTube

92
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,680
they're reading his book anything I can
do they're kind of trying to view but

93
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,878
they don't know what the roadmap is
really don't need to reconfigure the

94
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:16,910
router and so we don't have a good waves
upon boarding house you folks are

95
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,709
c-suite folks aboard people to
understand the language and the same

96
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:27,508
exact thing is true and so I watched
that unnamed locations initiatives where

97
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:33,100
they had a bunch of really actually
really smart cyber guys and try to

98
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,600
advise policy and watch out for a year
and then later on you got the policy

99
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,319
people how did that work out there like
many great technical stuff brake they

100
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:48,360
fix the problems we had them involved
four times the recommendations four

101
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,170
times are terrible they're not involved
in work that wasn't supposed to happen

102
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:59,300
in so in these experiments it quickly
realizes that there needs to be a better

103
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,899
way to bridge the gap so I'd say both
sides are willing now people are trying

104
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:10,250
but there's not a real good process for
either side to figure out how to work so

105
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:22,300
that's a really good luck to you draw
the audience probably worth and how do

106
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:39,979
we bring what are there are things you
can do in which the other relationship

107
00:13:39,980 --> 00:14:14,960
information security to do so and then
nothing until the next races

108
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:39,960
so we are seeing some areas I
desperately need technology largely on

109
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,700
its own

110
00:14:40,700 --> 00:15:00,800
really really I think that the
intervention as exceptional and this

111
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,020
case by case basis

112
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:11,060
exceptional

113
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:17,829
early discussions

114
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:28,630
translation her chances and Billy just
think there's a lot of this blows crimes

115
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:47,730
are all I think willing to come to a
deal so I think the results for its

116
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:55,900
cause is just

117
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:11,430
doesn't represent to talk to about it
we'll talk is going to represent the

118
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:31,910
European summit in so what happens is
that there is a problem even if you

119
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:44,850
remember I think experienced
practitioner sweet and not just the

120
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:59,040
language every time since it's always
been actual mister

121
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:12,740
both goals in the legal like we're just
gonna stay true to total language thing

122
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:21,069
I remember is talking to someone and
they were one of the world he said you

123
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:27,069
had a really good intervention
intervention like what it was like

124
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:31,770
something is now calling a delight to
bring them up to the like no no I asked

125
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,370
a question

126
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:39,719
ok so an intervention national forum is
essentially razor handle one finger and

127
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,400
eventually to finger to mention or it's
like you have a different language just

128
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,290
for the way you and so to an outsider I
thought you were busy rescuing the

129
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,830
insiders he was having a normal
conversation so just even get your foot

130
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,139
in the door you have to understand

131
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:08,470
the language I would say they
encountered that there's cards and card

132
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:37,260
only to realize that that is sure to I
would just like to stay in the context

133
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,260
of this current rulemaking that we've
been in the middle level that I have not

134
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:48,290
noticed any medicines in people and I
think that is absolutely great and i

135
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,970
really appreciate everybody's
willingness to spend time in resources

136
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:59,090
coming to talk to us because we want to
do that

137
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:04,120
a correct cost benefit analysis and we
want to understand the issues I think

138
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:12,159
that there is an awareness issue and I
don't know how to that we started

139
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,990
getting the comment will only issue the
proposed rulemaking but there was this

140
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,880
her language out there for a year and a
half the floor

141
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:29,930
rulemaking was even there the proposed
rule was published and in October before

142
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:36,940
we published the doctors say gay
brothers from Dartmouth had published an

143
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:43,360
article about the Boston area language
in it did come to us with a completely

144
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,760
different and I asked dr. products help
he had become real

145
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,420
divisive language he said he couldn't
quite remember how did it come to his

146
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,730
attention but he found it very concerned
that I don't know how you overcome their

147
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:03,070
initial hurdle of getting people to be
aware something that's coming down the

148
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:25,750
road and Twitter

149
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:58,060
realize there was a lot of difference of
understanding of some of the terms in

150
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:04,760
the rural that we quickly addressed
certainly all commands that address the

151
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:11,920
impact of the rule and its effect are
taken into consideration and if and when

152
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:19,110
a final rule is written it will include
a summary of all the comments and

153
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,879
whether we agree with the comments are
not and why

154
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:31,630
and then either another proposed
rulemaking her final rule seems to me

155
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:41,600
that there's a potential and for various
organizations individuals and

156
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,090
organizations governments have some
change they may be doing an honest

157
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:53,419
broker type is it fair to characterize
that may be in the government there's

158
00:21:53,420 --> 00:22:00,110
little point is that people change with
the administration and that there's a

159
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:26,399
government employees that are just
professional government concerns so too

160
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,910
are provided the success story or a
failure of information security

161
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:45,050
community and government interaction in
terms of engagement and you have to see

162
00:22:45,050 --> 00:23:00,990
it play out here so the factory a
success story mansion with the details

163
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:26,080
of where the language was pretty
terrible treated back so she was

164
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:36,070
actually talk about it and I think
positive

165
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:40,879
final proposal she submitted to the
European Commission was actually

166
00:23:40,880 --> 00:24:03,770
significantly better had it was it was
calling the dog now just to be clear on

167
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:23,840
this year by the way those are the
Commission's why some hundred lesions

168
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,260
and then thats

169
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:51,320
legislations so somewhat significant
proposal

170
00:24:51,320 --> 00:25:55,000
on these rules around and secretary very
delicately spirits the fact that at the

171
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,010
time

172
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:05,110
technical advisory committees needy
there were virtually no people from

173
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:18,750
there was one and not just you know we
can end up sixty things after their

174
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:35,200
broken

175
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,440
leaders

176
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:52,539
thanks I'm hoping to put this proposed
rulemaking in the next column as when it

177
00:26:52,539 --> 00:27:00,730
out and then again she prepared to that
awareness issue and I think that it is a

178
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:05,190
particular problem in this situation
because of the fast-moving days

179
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:12,080
acknowledged that the information
security we're all in the fact that for

180
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,178
example within the last two years

181
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:26,440
didn't exist grabs at the time that the
bus in our language was negotiated and

182
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:35,870
it's really hard to keep up so I think
that is an issue that we need to we need

183
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:41,959
to again have that awareness and it
should be at the beginning step prices

184
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:48,399
certainly hope that will continue now
that we have a lot of names and

185
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:53,789
organizations to call on in the future

186
00:27:53,789 --> 00:28:00,509
pensions which is a lot of these people
are are completely open to your feedback

187
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:03,169
I might not do anything with it

188
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:08,970
11 representative was at DEFCON and we
were talking and he was asking for

189
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:13,990
advice on something and I said you know
there's a lot of low-hanging fruit that

190
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:19,470
we could do and one for example.com base
actually the deal that's easy to tell

191
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:28,460
the girls are just regular sessions has
to provide services within the United

192
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,720
States

193
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,510
so if an item is a tracking FBI done all
that traffic comes inbound over the

194
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:43,230
fiber transatlantic traffic it's the USB
well if you push your PC name servers

195
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,270
out in other countries like everybody
else in the world you can absorb that

196
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:51,690
attack traffic elsewhere right why let
it come in well we're making us less

197
00:28:51,690 --> 00:29:02,130
resilient just because of a purchase
regime years ago and will week later

198
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:07,940
he's doing an interview and he mentions
that perfect right you want to start

199
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:14,650
influencing solutions and something as
simple as changing location servers

200
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,340
actually shows that he cares about cyber
he's interested he's trying to engage

201
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,840
and you need to kind of almost come
ready-made with the solution for some of

202
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,850
the representatives cuz they have to be
an expert on everything at a moment's

203
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,139
notice and so the more work you can do
for them

204
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,800
thinking through his the pros of this
idea here's the cons you don't want ever

205
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,210
cover up the cons and need to be no
everything's balance so you can provide

206
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,240
that for them

207
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:46,610
their friend and then you might get
invited back so about awareness

208
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:51,540
think the most important thing we should
probably talk about is the fact that

209
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,700
information security community or
industry everywhere college is very

210
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:03,850
diverse is actually important to do you
have some kind of clustering algorithm

211
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:10,370
that allows you to get as close as
possible to the mark because while it's

212
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:16,429
true that series generally speaking
rareness issue I would also argued for

213
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:22,010
the bus majority technical people it
should be like the vast majority of

214
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:28,519
technical people should not have to
worry about what's BIS or equivalent

215
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:35,619
published in the past by dates so what
we need as an industry find more people

216
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:49,649
actually pay for her reasons so that
they like eighties but essentially have

217
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:54,668
the different views cluster around
people dads have the knowledge and

218
00:30:54,669 --> 00:31:06,649
ability to keep up with what
policymakers are also on the

219
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:09,889
government's that's their many diverse
views

220
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:16,849
polarized views on matters of equally
frustrating yeah I mean again my limited

221
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:24,408
experience with this is that there are
so many different views within both yes

222
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:32,239
and your government so like another
important issue is that what you tell

223
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:36,139
comers doesn't necessarily work

224
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:48,958
stage ward as an asset and again I'm
using american so I think what would be

225
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:54,549
really useful on the government and is
to have some kind of map that also

226
00:31:54,549 --> 00:32:00,379
explains that have a practical example
to this red so for the longest time a

227
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:08,829
lot of people thought that for instance
it took a long time to figure out that

228
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:12,668
for the vast majority of the
stakeholders involved it had nothing to

229
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:14,200
do with human rights

230
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:23,799
bugs essentially dad changelog detect
conversation we had everything that that

231
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:28,190
type of work

232
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:39,730
ok perhaps the most important question I
think we can ask the panel's hearing

233
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:45,700
bits and pieces of it come out what our
solutions you can do what are some of

234
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:51,049
the best practices in things like the
road people who speak the languages of

235
00:32:51,049 --> 00:33:00,039
trucks first so I would like to go down
and relevant to our panelists expertise

236
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:06,019
what are things that work and asked not
just one but as an instructor I learned

237
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:11,549
that she challenged people to come up
with three things down and in there they

238
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:18,799
said they might back at 10 and so I
asked for three ideas from the palace in

239
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:29,379
the past week and I would also say that
reason really the buzzwords actionable

240
00:33:29,379 --> 00:33:34,820
solutions like if you go to senior
leader is on fire this thing's going to

241
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:44,908
explode flux capacitors are traffic flow
and they didn't have to go there resent

242
00:33:44,909 --> 00:34:12,020
them that they can actually get sick
often start the ones that aren't so

243
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:22,190
ideas for the whole spectrum I did you
want to get in just the weekend or do

244
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,010
you wanna turn in tomorrow

245
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:30,580
and you know because it's really a
passion and so when I was it I can we

246
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,250
have these public comment periods all
the time as a multi-stakeholder model

247
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:39,679
representing the entire Internet is
really important for us to get feedback

248
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,418
so sort of like your comment period we
ran comment periods all the time and I

249
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:47,219
can and it was super frustrating because
we could not get very representative

250
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:51,839
feedback mean there is there are people
who are legendary that provided feedback

251
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,909
on every proposal had never come to a
meeting we don't know what the person

252
00:34:55,909 --> 00:35:00,160
looks like a robot but all we knew was
no matter anytime is a comment period

253
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,379
there is 1 user identity that always
commented and it turned out by just

254
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,700
showing up people actually really cared
what that one user identity said because

255
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:16,230
that person was relieved festival so I'd
say when the comment period opened for

256
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:22,150
dinner is almost like you can't win if
you don't show up so the least provide a

257
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,940
comment and it might not be the most
informed comment but provide comments

258
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,080
because I can I think one of the
comments that came out of the OC was

259
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:38,490
we've got the most number of comments of
any on what that tells him home so I

260
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,410
follow like I said yeah I can in a
couple of the internet he things they

261
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:48,370
care about and there consoling
announcing comment and so I'll go and

262
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:54,160
I'll check them out so that's an easy as
you think though other thing is in the

263
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,700
role at DHS

264
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,779
exactly right everything every task and
we get has to be actionable can

265
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:06,140
secretary something the secretary can do
and can do within a year maybe two but

266
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,190
you can't make it a three year thing and
it really it's because you like well if

267
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:14,090
they coordinated with treasury then they
coordinated with the DoD then you could

268
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:18,900
do this awesome thing like you but you
can't control those two other entities

269
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,030
what has to be totally wholly owned
within right

270
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,650
until when you can strain like that it's
also something liberating because now

271
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:32,710
you know that you no longer have these
externalities it's like all the pieces

272
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:35,320
that could possibly be used to solve the
problem

273
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,850
are here we just have to figure out how
to put together so I think focus on

274
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,930
those do things right and the other
thing I see people's over reach all the

275
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:48,460
time every task forces on people one
employer ocean's problems it's like

276
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:54,270
we're not gonna get the next more
important as we can solve this one so I

277
00:36:54,270 --> 00:37:00,600
think actually in low in what you pick
something and do it well don't try to

278
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,810
peak 10 things to show your range of
flexibility how awesome you are doing

279
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,630
things really well

280
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:20,560
government it's all in the resource it
demonstrates your way if you try to take

281
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:28,870
on ten things badly that you have to get
some wins so what's happening like you

282
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:32,700
mentioned in gear what happens is
finally in the room on the task force I

283
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,359
don't know everyone another task force
against I've gotta make the most of this

284
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,440
opportunity and then all of a sudden off
to the races and trying to fix it once

285
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,400
with one shot and has acknowledged you
do well people know that you did well

286
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,490
you're great Jupiter you'll be invited
but you try to do it all your first

287
00:37:51,490 --> 00:38:06,680
audition i've seen serious that's like
competition but exactly if you were in

288
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:12,129
government what would be your 110 like
will actually not the one thing you

289
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:18,440
wanna get done what you're one idea got
any ideas like that's that's great but

290
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:26,670
one because you you probably could do
you can't do five example he went in and

291
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,030
said

292
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:32,860
speed-up acquisition process engaged the
hacker community came up with soccer

293
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:43,320
fast track that was that happen and i
think is underwriters laboratory that's

294
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:51,570
one thing I'd like to look at it from
the perspective of somebody who is

295
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:56,660
actually implementing and running a
regulatory program keeping aside the

296
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:04,720
proposed rulemaking we have an ongoing
licensing process and we do depend on

297
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,439
exporters who have to come in and buy a
reporter registrations are license

298
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,230
applications and so forth to let us know
what's painful that's not how we can do

299
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:24,380
things better and we try to keep as open
a avenue of communication with them as

300
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,820
possible with emails with phone calls
keeping contact information on the

301
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:34,230
website etcetera and I like to think
that we are responsive to essentially

302
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:39,880
our constituency in the ongoing
implementation of the regulations so

303
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:47,690
different a lower-level second floor 7th
floor look at the issue but that is my

304
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:53,170
day-to-day work generally in terms of
trying to keep a regulatory process

305
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:59,420
going

306
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:07,880
so I would say this sort of a link for
the three things that I have the maximum

307
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,349
both sides whether you are agitating for
intervention or whether you are the

308
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:21,530
regulator policymakers should be to do
no harm and it is really easy to demand

309
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:28,170
that somebody do something you don't
have that map if you don't understand

310
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:37,940
all the implications of these are asking
them to stop and back when you do so

311
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:45,420
more specifically ask questions when you
engage with policy trying to understand

312
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,930
what their stake in this is try to
understand their assumptions but you

313
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:57,140
don't see a lot of questions when you
see industry engagement you see a lot of

314
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:05,319
Randy sitting there being yelled at and
you know some of the best progress that

315
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:11,970
we've made in this entire process has
been a result asking the right questions

316
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:17,118
and suddenly putting the pieces together
or a motivation was or what an

317
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,270
underlying assumption for inaction was
and you don't get there if you don't

318
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:35,160
just find workable solution don't try to
do everything it one time and projects

319
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,450
to hang on

320
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:46,730
make sure people know how to find you
that's that's a really good one

321
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,430
it's great if you've got one friend in
government or who does this kind of

322
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:55,140
thing but make sure that people know
that you're available if you want to be

323
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,569
participating in this process it's very
easy to say I am I am Here I am friendly

324
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:06,599
and I'm ready to help and people will
come to you for that kind of help right

325
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:13,030
now so there will be no your door and if
you are the right person for something

326
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:22,150
or bring the right person with you so
I'll try to go into very specific

327
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:32,940
details first prepare written anything
for two reasons first one because of

328
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:41,910
what I found is that it's really easy to
be misunderstood something written form

329
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:50,190
letters are somewhat understandable by
the policymaker will go much much you

330
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:55,770
can say at a conference or somewhere
else in what way does really people

331
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:05,640
cause you understand on the flip side
does means that brownie brownie points

332
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,450
with them and so they will actually be
willing to listen to you

333
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:14,109
the second thing is that I think it's
important to realize that almost always

334
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:19,339
negotiation process and you are
negotiating from a position of weakness

335
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:26,650
so I can adjust to things first there is
an awesome video by some harvard

336
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:32,630
professor talks about negotiating
strongly suggest you watch that the

337
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:39,670
second one is to understand what the
other party wants and it it's a

338
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:47,790
different answer based like professional
government employees are deep divisions

339
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:54,529
what part of government what side of the
political spectrum and Sons for those

340
00:43:54,530 --> 00:44:02,770
onward dad we need to do the last thing
I would say is that both myron jack

341
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:09,869
mentioned as so it's it's important to
us to ask the right at the same time

342
00:44:09,869 --> 00:44:19,089
it's also important for you like scope
down what you want a solution to be in

343
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:26,009
other words if for instance were talking
about soccer liabilities the answer

344
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:30,440
well this is an undecidable problem
because of the outing problem is not an

345
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:39,010
answer so so it is in in in in in order
that on average it somewhat hard to do

346
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,180
that on our side

347
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:46,680
underlying details that you need to ask
but it's very it's very important for

348
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:57,618
the other side because it's so on the
government's I think it's important for

349
00:44:57,619 --> 00:45:11,099
governments to realize that they're not
talking to so there must be on their

350
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:17,810
side also an effort to be willing to
listen to a difference of language both

351
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:24,990
again both in terms of actual language
opinions expressed very thing which

352
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:31,470
inures wishful thinking is I would wish
for more honesty because no seriously

353
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:38,319
cuz like if you tell me that your state
commanders I will not get my promotional

354
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:44,779
esters does past I don't care and
technical person I couldn't care less so

355
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:50,810
just tell me and I will help you get
that promotion wild same time not doing

356
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:58,369
something like I think I think there is
important that is not something that

357
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:03,960
happens at all I can add multiple times

358
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:09,240
assistance of politicians emailing me
from your personal account

359
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:14,560
essentially paraphrasing what the
politicians told me and that is not

360
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,619
there is not a physical way of dealing
with these things

361
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:25,460
anything oh and the third thing is that
I had a fundamental level i think that

362
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:33,670
again this is the type of thing but it
would be really useful government

363
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:40,369
actually resources understanding in
terms of information security in

364
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:46,230
actually understand what they think this
is something we're talking about a few

365
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:54,050
people I think there there's a lot of
misunderstanding which brings all sorts

366
00:46:54,050 --> 00:47:01,300
of different problems in terms of what
regulation is actually thanks I'd also

367
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:07,950
add responsiveness to the media
sometimes they need an answer quickly so

368
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:12,060
if you turn around and coherent answer
quickly that they can understand every

369
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,290
pressure send it to them a week later

370
00:47:16,290 --> 00:48:07,920
first-hand there

371
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:19,220
questions what some policy and are there
are basically two communities against

372
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,700
the government having a classified high
side discussion on the subject and then

373
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:29,399
everyone else having discussion are the
two to what extent is going on inside or

374
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:36,070
outside so that's the panel have this
other thing right now on my notepad

375
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:41,210
which I wanted to bring up which is
essentially a lot of this is that these

376
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:46,190
are all the opening salvos in what I i
consider the dual use war right

377
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:51,050
technologies that were not sort of do
user now do use and government doesn't

378
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:54,580
know what to do about it we don't know
what to do about it and so for example

379
00:48:54,580 --> 00:49:00,710
is an arms control arrangements
essentially be controlled things like

380
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:05,650
frequency hopping radio I can program
one of those things with my Raspberry Pi

381
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:14,570
now but in the eighties nowadays it's
like the new radio right so how does

382
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:18,500
that apply mean I would argue that the
radio part of Austin doesn't make any

383
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:24,870
sense yet it still regulated but it's
something you know birds supply chain

384
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:29,170
management I think Apple devices phones
now used to be that they had to have

385
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:33,330
liked each use cause of the radios in
them and every version they get better

386
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:39,950
and better and having suffered radio so
there's some point will be just one and

387
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:43,899
the frequencies attacks on will be
whatever its program to do for that

388
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:44,840
country

389
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,310
well that's a completely softer defined
radio that our cell phones now you know

390
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:55,230
prohibited so we're moving into this
area where you can't use normal

391
00:49:55,230 --> 00:50:00,830
compliance mechanisms how do you know
that the person does not using that to

392
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:07,020
defeat in arms and so so is happening in
the debate you see Apple's sort of at

393
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:11,500
the forefront of it I give him kudos for
being so courageous but these are like

394
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,620
the tip of the spear kind of problems
we're dealing with for the next 15 years

395
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:19,589
in so that's why I think it's really
important to take these lessons learned

396
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:23,510
in start getting involved because it's
going to impact you one way or the other

397
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:27,350
if you don't think in 10 years after
liability reforms gonna come down the

398
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:27,839
road

399
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:32,690
the toaster will burn down the house
will kill someone in somebody will get

400
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:36,730
sued an Internet of Things in the
software shrink wrap license is gonna

401
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:43,000
come under scrutiny from legislators are
and use a software developer might want

402
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,960
to think about that so it's not like
this is a one offered to other things

403
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,340
and then to your point about yesterday
discussions are happening on the low

404
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:58,310
side and it's really just because it's
kind of boiling down who enforce the law

405
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:06,549
enforcement

406
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:21,990
panel but if you are interested in
engaging on a particular issue another

407
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:26,450
part of the permanent commerce to
flourish and his office is working on

408
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:30,509
everyone's favorite old chestnut
vulnerability disclosure trying to bring

409
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:34,420
together researchers vendors across
sectors across the reports the research

410
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:40,750
ecosystem to see if we can't actually
demonstrated a community that we can

411
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:44,750
solve this other parts of government are
going to step in and solve it and the

412
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:49,310
Department of Commerce likes it when
industry can handle things itself so if

413
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:53,890
you're interested please come and find
me engage in the lots of other parts of

414
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:58,240
government that are now really trying to
work out and get more expertise from in

415
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,290
a sec you'll find people who you know
talk to friends of friends people do

416
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:08,759
want to hear from you think that's a
good people open up opportunities we

417
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,510
have to take advantage of them and to go
there in good faith and be participants

418
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:27,990
in question

419
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:49,979
so basically you're saying security as
preventive aspects reactionary

420
00:52:49,980 --> 00:53:04,950
practitioners how do they three of the
time to care about job security but by

421
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:17,029
the time like seriously because a lot of
this may be my not be like sharing some

422
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:31,290
you directly so no matter how unknowing
to some extent in this spending some

423
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:47,300
I don't think so I think it would be
company there is your chance to focus on

424
00:53:47,300 --> 00:54:04,770
this there was one that will put out by
late last year and this is a really

425
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:09,980
extraordinary either because the authors
to 18 months you're right it is an

426
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:17,000
example of low in the polls thirty

427
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,670
smartest people in

428
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:24,630
world on both of those subjects who are
distributed by source type and one of

429
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:29,990
the things you can do is try to find
those resources that are you like Wilson

430
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:36,720
Center does things like this credit
rating substantial overviews and

431
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:42,640
retrospectives and try to find which
that's so you don't necessarily need to

432
00:54:42,640 --> 00:55:08,910
be yourself but find and talk to them

433
00:55:08,910 --> 00:56:02,600
so there was something was gonna happen
even in the seven actually twelve

434
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:08,580
there's always talk about information
information change took hold the well

435
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:15,310
was sort of pitch disease panacea least
invasive everybody likes sharing

436
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:20,020
information we're gonna government we're
gonna get government out of the way will

437
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:24,940
help you know seller a chair and that's
a good thing how can that be bad and so

438
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:31,740
ever since 2012 at least it's been just
keeps coming up and go hard to say

439
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:37,939
you're against sharing and so if there
was this inevitability it was gonna

440
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:41,100
happen when we see other people did the
claim that they did some sort of

441
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:46,040
positive legislation was against
information sharing and so it became the

442
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:56,270
perfect need and then like you got to do
is reduce well-crafted

443
00:56:56,270 --> 00:57:50,960
lecture what's the relationship of
politics policy and to go a little bit

444
00:57:50,960 --> 00:58:13,620
of liberty to say how do hackers hack
this complex system and really are

445
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:21,690
unanswered questions on both sides
generally speaking when governments are

446
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:26,910
currently hiring I would think
government's you understand our policy

447
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:33,220
in this space in states where the
objective are there on a spectrum but

448
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:40,459
these are unknown but we're not doing
much better on this site so you know

449
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:49,290
right now it's very much deep in there
is no 11 imminent threat

450
00:58:49,290 --> 00:59:02,720
but the question is what we want results
from each of these not limping around

451
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:10,299
ideas that I think so far the secretary
to problems are not rising enough yet

452
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:19,540
from which is in the sense that there
there are and who you're fine right wing

453
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:27,470
or left wing positions on cyber matters
which is an abandoned that being said

454
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:34,830
what I was saying is that everyone you
talk to us some kind of agenda position

455
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:42,310
in after wild well like it's actually
pretty sure all the other party wants

456
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:48,750
what it's really hard work really hard
is to understand the relationship

457
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:53,270
between maybe the political parts

458
00:59:53,270 --> 01:00:00,950
counterparts but to a great extent that
is not something you should be concerned

459
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:06,430
about as long as you can have
conversations and then eventually you

460
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:15,960
relate since he was younger age in which
the pending a really complicated one

461
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:21,010
very quick for instance what was saying
before about the European Union the

462
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:26,440
reality is that European Parliament's
years the body dad actually approves the

463
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:33,930
budget at the same time the European
Commission years the one to trust the

464
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,000
regulation

465
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:46,650
the latest so there is a carefully
crafted balanced air sort of like in the

466
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:54,390
details on that balance so you'll find
key to come to the conversation I think

467
01:00:54,390 --> 01:01:02,859
the same applies to the USA with
different mechanism I think that one man

468
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:03,880
to thank our speakers
