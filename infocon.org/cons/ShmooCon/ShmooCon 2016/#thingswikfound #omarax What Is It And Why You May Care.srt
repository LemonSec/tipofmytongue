1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
a research engineer at Dallas Cisco and
as a warning I am an expert in none of

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:19,350
what you're about to hear so how many
people by show of hands search these

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:31,269
hash tags before now you will be in for
a fun ride let me tell you so in my

4
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:34,260
research I find all the time

5
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:42,030
a malicious domain and like many of you
I am curious a ok who owns this domain

6
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,390
and how many other to me and say they
have so in in doing my research you look

7
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,239
up your DomainTools you plug in your
email address and you find out that they

8
00:00:53,239 --> 00:01:02,519
have over 3000 other demands summer
would be malicious me not be how how do

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:10,240
you know how you could sit there and
visit each and every one or you could be

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,960
lazy and like I am very lazy and
everybody who knows he will say

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,240
otherwise

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:23,339
so what i'll do is all download as CSV
of all air links are you someplace on

13
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,189
and silentium or maybe some other two
light web shot and all visit every

14
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,829
single one of these websites and I
haven't I saw slideshow I can go through

15
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:42,820
and judging by the content I can tell
it's a fishing or if their web page got

16
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:53,880
hacked and malicious domain and and and
here's some you're expected results so

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,600
I'll go through three thousand domains
I'll find many tech support scam

18
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:09,978
find many deface pages many you name it
weather is iCloud I found a Starbucks

19
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,520
fishing state the other day I found a
home depot phishing site the other day

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,739
you named a brand name I have found a
phishing site for it and of course

21
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:30,170
unexpected results would often get
tweeted was a hash sounds things work

22
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,220
vandellas thing is every day you visit
the site and you get in a slang of the

23
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,400
day and you get two guys and it tells
you what he does for a living

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,050
where he works some things he likes some
things he dislikes now I personally

25
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:53,670
think the likes and dislikes are made up
I don't know and then here's some other

26
00:02:53,670 --> 00:03:01,190
things you might find I would love to
know what an asparagus labor though is

27
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:07,989
why is it like acupuncture but they stab
you with asparagus you have to eat so

28
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:13,540
much that I just can't picture is just
awesome

29
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:21,850
you've gotta share that doing so after
finding some of these these sayings and

30
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:29,358
more because I kinda intrigued by the
random this that's out there I decide to

31
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:39,329
go crazy on a Saturday afternoon no
reason just thought so here's my

32
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:48,450
original sketches kind of blurry so what
my plan was is to take domains ever

33
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,230
created the day before

34
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:57,100
not just one TLD every TLD I can get
access to users don't files or domain

35
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,019
points.com and wipe them into

36
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:11,930
to ask you a skill and then have a bunch
of a WSN nodes go out in parallel and

37
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:18,130
motto process and visit all of these
sites and as many of you may know

38
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:29,530
there's two million or so sites
generated daily so here's reporter the

39
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:36,440
magic happens once I have all these
thumbnails of all these pictures how do

40
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:52,050
I find the malicious items like that one
images bad of this insight so magic are

41
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,170
described the magic arises when an
excuse to use the low woman there her

42
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:09,450
name is she is at the moment just me you
stand up here from anything so then all

43
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:15,680
these images you've connoisseurs room in
the fund stops then you have to manually

44
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:25,160
looks through 84,000 images in a folder
and then you take those will you do with

45
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:34,820
those you could email what I do is send
out 300 to 3000 emails a day to whoever

46
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:43,200
owns the IP addresses and say hey your
website surfaced about it or hey this is

47
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,960
a phishing site you know let's take the
stairs I'm sure you don't wanna be

48
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,090
hosting this fishing site and many
people are pretty responsive I won't

49
00:05:53,090 --> 00:06:01,440
name names would like to maybe privately
on Twitter of those who aren't so here's

50
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:10,180
the magic what what I've tried to do
when I first started as I used numpy I

51
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:16,700
converted each image to a numpy array
and compared the percentage of how

52
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,390
similar the arrays were to each other
and it works really well

53
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:29,820
of figuring out whether one in the was
the same as another image the problem

54
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:36,190
with that is once you get above three
thousand images the disk i/o of opening

55
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:42,560
and closing every image just to compare
your three thousand images to one image

56
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:53,740
to see you find a match takes forever so
what I found our images as they may have

57
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:03,220
heard of him before I ever heard about

58
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:10,680
so the way they work for the rest of
evil is it takes to similar images and

59
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,900
it will convert into black and white
shrinking down to a nose eyes and then

60
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:22,580
it will calculate a hash based on the
pictures so the two cats on the bottom

61
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,669
will actually have the very same hash so
you can feed them through even though

62
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:36,640
the images are slightly different I can
tell it the same and this was really

63
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,640
weird for me because I tried twelve
different things which I an hour to tell

64
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:49,880
you everything are trying to build a
much more interesting story so random

65
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:58,260
things I found if you know anybody
that's afraid of clowns and want the

66
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:06,849
actual URL for this to buy willed child
like clowns scare the crap group going

67
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:15,550
now which is what your ass was grimly
funny I played a game with this and

68
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:22,820
before I show it to anybody I asked them
to tell me if it was porn or not you

69
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:31,810
have no idea how much fun I'm still
doing that to stop after this very basis

70
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:45,490
and the guy on the far right I have no
clue why like why would you do that in

71
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:52,089
his mouth dawg

72
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:56,930
I understand that but you wanted a
picture of you you gonna stay current

73
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:11,339
zone webpage needed anyway so I am
really tired and falling management

74
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:21,220
because how do you convince your boss
that finding all these fun things and

75
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,069
sharing of them actually being
productive and I tend to like my job

76
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:37,660
very much so I had to come over some
numbers so that I lose through 245

77
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:45,670
million domains so I was taking all the
newly created in means and then I had a

78
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:59,449
wild idea of the dot-com and died in
that zone files into this thing and then

79
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:04,910
realize how much of a bad idea was
because I got returned 84 million images

80
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:12,769
that I had to try and go through and
what is are removed all the landing

81
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:19,240
pages are checked for that i jus numpy
check or in the image and make sure it's

82
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,400
not one solid color and then everything
else I sent to

83
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:37,569
bucket way for me to download problem I
have hit so many walls doing this I

84
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:44,060
found out that has had a 12 hour limit
so if you pay fifty million items into

85
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,609
an escrow asked you and you're not
working fast enough to process those

86
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:56,220
they just start dropping off the back
and think hey client to these pretty

87
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:07,550
click the Add you're not just me so out
of over 2,000 malicious sites many of

88
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:14,189
which were just created days if not a
week before or somebody said phishing

89
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,880
site just haven't advertising is just
sitting there

90
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,290
chills and I'm going to uses somewhere

91
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:29,589
many were defaced pages so and I have a
theory I have not been able to prove

92
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,620
this but there are some divisions out
there and I hope they don't come after

93
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:39,250
me for saying this I think they are
buying domains and defacing them and

94
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,050
saying look I just two phases web page

95
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:49,680
those mice Erie Ave by wants to help me
prove that theory it would make for an

96
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,949
awesome talk or somethin somethin crazy

97
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:03,670
tech support scams are kinda dear to me
I had a friend whose father fell for a

98
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:11,120
fake tech support hey your computer has
a virus go here and luckily he was smart

99
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,200
enough when the guys heard asking for
money he Eastern clashing as I want a

100
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,250
second opinion and all this other stuff
and his computer screen and we started

101
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,839
going crazy why I watched it but not
only that having a friend's father fall

102
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:37,890
for this I had a fake IRS call recently
that scared the crap outta my wife so in

103
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,589
a way that works doesn't really have
much do this are going to tell you

104
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:46,600
anyway the way that works is they they
call and leave message machine they tell

105
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:53,110
you that they are for so so I R Us law
enforcement and there's a lawsuit

106
00:12:53,110 --> 00:13:02,370
against please call this number it's a
robot dial number and we own $500 liar

107
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:09,240
us so to my wife this could be a legit
and we forgot to pay off the last last

108
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:26,740
little bit of whatever was on pins and
needles and exactly my wife's job so she

109
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,150
called and right away this Sergio natter

110
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:37,770
and and two years she's like I want to I
don't want to go in court but you know

111
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:43,920
I'm not going to get your money ground
what sure she knows enough about what i

112
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,469
do to go you know what your number let
me call you back

113
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:52,050
arbitrary pay for this gonna talk to my
husband and right away they were very

114
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:58,109
rude and disrespectful we're going to
call your local authorities don't go

115
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,530
anywhere they'll be there within an hour
so when I sir doing this and start

116
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:10,040
fining them I start calling these
numbers and I get in my car nitrogen to

117
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:16,969
drive to Walmart and then I'd pretend to
send a MoneyGram and just to waste their

118
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:26,060
time and then I start firing these
things everywhere like every day there's

119
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:33,430
twenty new ones that pop up and luckily
through Twitter I found a contact of hey

120
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:40,310
this is how you can look up who owns
that number so I've made it my mission

121
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:48,119
for these 1313 thousand under whatever
number of mentally ill hit thousand

122
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,390
these people I've been taking their
numbers away from them

123
00:14:54,390 --> 00:15:04,689
a very nice mosaic image of a company
logo made purely over thousands of

124
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:13,130
taking drugs off the street and 20 and
you know 25 binaries nobody's seen

125
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,850
before

126
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:21,980
number sounds kinda small when you see
the average oh this is the DAS binary oh

127
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,300
this is just a brute-force fine area
when you find stuff that's new that

128
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:34,140
you've never seen before I get excited
about it often I mess it up and have to

129
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:39,830
hand it off to somebody else but I still
get excited about it so the moral of the

130
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:49,060
story is a very small ideas can quickly
get out of hand this started as a

131
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:57,229
five-minute solve a problem and I've
been doing this for the last six months

132
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:06,100
and would start out as oh well what if I
matches images this way next weekend

133
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:12,470
oh I've got way too many images match
these images this is gotten to the point

134
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:20,320
where I'm sitting watching TV in the
evening and I'm just tap and hittin the

135
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,560
down one Next Next Next just looking
through images trying to fine bad guys

136
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:34,959
and happen along things and my wife
comes to me and she looks at me with my

137
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:41,370
feet up on the coffee table asking me
can you be any more lazy doing your job

138
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:49,870
I i understand what you're doing but you
were just seems too lazy and I thought

139
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:55,630
