1
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,560
my name is Ray Davidson I am the project

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,539
leader

3
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,180
Grand High exalted Puba for the Michigan

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,040
cyber civilian Corps

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,579
and I am very happy to be here because I

6
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,800
wasn't sure that Circle city con was

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,300
going to happen does anybody how many of

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,180
you plan to go to come when it was like

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,940
earlier did anybody come in May

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,660
anybody show up I I submitted my talk

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,700
and then didn't hear anything I and this

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,980
is not a Slama at staff or anything like

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,480
that I know it was terrible but it was

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,100
I'm glad to be here I didn't think it

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,120
was going to happen

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,879
so I am from Michigan

17
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,100
Michigan is one of the other states in

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,799
FEMA region five anybody here not from

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,540
Indiana

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,939
where oh oh okay where are you from

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,240
uh okay Ohio has one of these

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,040
which if you didn't know I'll tell you

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,479
about it who else is from some place

24
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,580
besides Indiana

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,659
okay my knowledge in Illinois does not

26
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,880
so I'm brainwashing you and sending you

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,939
off to be an embedded um spy in Illinois

28
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,920
how about you sir

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,180
okay where in Illinois

30
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,119
okay so you're actually pretty close to

31
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,079
Michigan

32
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,659
you should come to gercon

33
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,380
and you who else is not yeah

34
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,700
okay

35
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,220
you look for me

36
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,479
probably

37
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,119
yeah okay and you saw her in the back

38
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,520
Jersey

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,140
do you know him

40
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,119
right okay

41
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,079
um isn't that

42
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,880
okay there's a New Jersey guy I just saw

43
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,200
on the news but he's in Pennsylvania

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,959
he's running for Pennsylvania

45
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,540
yes uh the news right

46
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,879
president

47
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,120
I I know you can see Russia from there

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,640
right so um I'm going to talk to you

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,319
about the Michigan cyber civilian Corps

50
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,540
but I'm going to spend a few minutes

51
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,620
because the mission and cyber student

52
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,360
Corps is uh um

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,160
we get some publicity

54
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,040
and people think it is a thing

55
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,800
uh and and I love the positive positive

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,900
publicity people think we're cooler than

57
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,940
we are I know this because I just went

58
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,099
over to Wisconsin Wisconsin also has a

59
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,920
cyber civilian Corps and I thought they

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
were really really cool and then they

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,500
started telling me about all the

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,660
problems they have I mean it's it's

63
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,580
startup problems so I'll tell you some

64
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,620
of the adventure we have this is I I

65
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,940
love this job

66
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,680
so I'm going to tell you why I love the

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,540
job I'm going to try and tell you what

68
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,379
we're trying to do with the Michigan

69
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,440
cyber civilian Corps

70
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,540
um but I want to to give you a caveat

71
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,879
here this is from halvor flake

72
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,140
um someone if you've been around for a

73
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,239
while you know the name haliber flake I

74
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,180
forget how I knew his name from my early

75
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,360
cyber security training but he says and

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
this is uh this happens all the time I

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,319
get calls from people that say how

78
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,180
should I start my cyber security career

79
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,340
you know what what should I be doing and

80
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,680
in fact I've got a guy from Purdue that

81
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,720
I hope would be here he's going to talk

82
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,220
to you but this is the this is the thing

83
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,319
when I started cyber security cyber

84
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,360
security wasn't even a thing like like

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,220
cyber wasn't a thing computers were just

86
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,599
starting to be

87
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,900
come into into being and the whole way

88
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,700
that you got into it was being

89
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,519
interested in what's in the gaps like

90
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,980
not the official subject so if you're

91
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,120
thinking of going to school in computer

92
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,920
science because you want to get into

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,319
computer security by all means listen to

94
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,540
what I have to say but I do not have a

95
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,819
road map and I think anybody that tells

96
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,620
you a road map is probably wrong because

97
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,599
if you're going to get started for

98
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,040
something that's going to come to

99
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,440
fruition in five or ten years the world

100
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,299
is going to change I mean you only have

101
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:07,319
to think about what's happened in the

102
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,060
past two years

103
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,840
so and I I do have to

104
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,680
quibble about

105
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,339
that's not working

106
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,979
sometimes I can make this be a highlight

107
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,300
but that last line having gone

108
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,660
mainstream I resent that but you know

109
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,520
it's what he said so I have to use the

110
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,139
quote so

111
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,080
where did I you know you know so what is

112
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,240
one way of getting started I started my

113
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,580
career in cyber security as a chemical

114
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,460
engineer I was in graduate school at

115
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,139
Purdue in West Lafayette

116
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,699
and I think it was about 1982 when like

117
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,199
as a graduate student you're on campus

118
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,940
all the time undergraduates at the hall

119
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,440
when they go to co-ops or whatever but

120
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,940
in the summer it's really nice nice

121
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,840
quiet

122
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,419
and so all the undergraduates left and

123
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:01,259
these um these shroud terminals started

124
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,699
appearing all over campus they were

125
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,240
beige and they had green writing you

126
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,479
know 3270 type Terminals and it turned

127
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:10,740
out they were installing a network of

128
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,820
factions

129
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,639
and the undergraduates came back and

130
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,740
they got training we were graduate

131
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,020
students we we didn't nobody thought we

132
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,280
were very important

133
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,560
if you're gonna sing I'm gonna

134
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,020
save it for the question period okay

135
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,539
well it's it's all right we do have the

136
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,880
Kumbaya at the end and you'll recognize

137
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,360
why uh but so I said Purdue the internet

138
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,300
appeared and at the time it appeared I'd

139
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,919
already done my Master's Degree and for

140
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,539
those of you that don't or aren't in

141
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,880
graduate school and uh there were these

142
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,800
things called typewriters back in the

143
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,500
old days and if you got a graduate

144
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,479
degree you had to get somebody to type

145
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,139
your paper on like 80 cotton some

146
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,199
special expensive paper and it was like

147
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,000
a dollar and a half a page for them to

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,039
type and you didn't have to pay if they

149
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,900
had to backspace or anything they have

150
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,940
white out back then do not use white out

151
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,199
on your screens it doesn't work on

152
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,699
computers that was the old way of doing

153
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:09,479
things

154
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,080
and in between my masters and my PhD

155
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,060
that was when they installed the

156
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,060
vaccines and the one thing that I found

157
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,000
out was that it would do type setting to

158
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,160
do in Roth t-roth for those of you that

159
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,300
that did Unix this was Unix 4.2 ESD

160
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,479
before anything so so we learned about

161
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,780
computers and at that time secure cyber

162
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,880
security was remembering to lock your

163
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,259
terminal before you went to the bathroom

164
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,660
because one of your fellow graduate

165
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,060
students would get in and put

166
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,979
um well I would call it a scene but

167
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,100
ASCII art you know not really high

168
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,900
resolution enough to be obscene but you

169
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,819
come back and there would be all kinds

170
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,319
of things that would go in your dot

171
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,580
profile when you blog back on the

172
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,440
computer that was cyber security back

173
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,000
then

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,400
so I got out I worked for I started

175
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,500
working for a pharmaceutical company

176
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,660
anybody happen to know what is located

177
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,080
at 30

178
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,680
30 years ago it was a company called

179
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,840
syntax do you ever taken a drug called

180
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,819
Naprosyn Naproxen

181
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,680
it's a painkiller non non-steroidal

182
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,120
anti-inflammatory that was their big

183
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,220
thing after they invented the sexual

184
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,560
Revolution

185
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,520
the syntax was one of the first

186
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,800
providers of oral contraceptives so it

187
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,020
was on Hillview Avenue Palo Alto great

188
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,180
place to be across the street from the

189
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,280
Xerox Palo Alto Research Center anybody

190
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,919
know what that is Xerox Park is where

191
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,300
Windows Mouse

192
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,880
the windows interface Mouse pointer wimp

193
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,099
was invented that's where Steve Jobs

194
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:44,160
stole the uh the whole Macintosh

195
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,440
operating system see jobs was around the

196
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,979
corner next when I was at syntax syntax

197
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,120
went out of business because they did

198
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,479
not reproduce Naprosyn and currently

199
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,419
3401 Hillview Avenue is the quarters of

200
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,280
VMware

201
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,639
it's pretty cool so so I I got out of

202
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,919
syntax it was too expensive to live

203
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,900
there but it was in Silicon Valley and I

204
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,599
my first computer was a Macintosh

205
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,300
you know like not Unix not Windows

206
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,900
really weird so so I left the um I left

207
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,699
the West Coast too expensive moved to

208
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,979
the Midwest Kalamazoo Michigan

209
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,139
pretty different from San Francisco I

210
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,060
work for a pharmaceutical company Pfizer

211
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,620
which you probably all know heard of I

212
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,660
went to work for upjohn

213
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,280
I worked went to work as a

214
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,780
pharmaceutical scientist I worked for

215
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,700
Animal Health created a formulation for

216
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,399
mastitis which is an infection of udders

217
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,580
in cows and it keeps you from being able

218
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,559
to drink milk because if a cow gets

219
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,479
mastitis they throw away the milk it's

220
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,060
very expensive for the farmers so I

221
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,700
worked on Pharmaceuticals but

222
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,980
the difficulty with Pharmaceuticals is

223
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,600
that they have to be stable on the on

224
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,339
the Shelf like if you go to Walgreens or

225
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:54,420
CVS

226
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,279
it could be that that drug has been on

227
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,860
the shelf for a year and we you want to

228
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,980
make sure that that drug is 100 or 99

229
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,480
potent and it can degrade a little bit

230
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,360
but in order to prove that the drug is

231
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,060
stable for two years on the Shelf guess

232
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,459
how long the experiment takes

233
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,959
two years

234
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,399
and then you have to do the duplicate

235
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,680
and triple it's not very exciting folks

236
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,959
and if you like dealing with people I

237
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,880
mean you know think of me doing this

238
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,760
talking to test tubes it's like really

239
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,920
boring there was a disturbance in the

240
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,959
force you all know about Shadow I.T

241
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,820
right anybody know not know what shadow

242
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,459
I.T is it's the it's the person you go

243
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:35,640
to that knows how to do pivot tables or

244
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,040
they know how to spin up a web page 20

245
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,600
years ago

246
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,420
um so there was Shadow I.T large

247
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,000
corporations historically about every

248
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,279
five to ten years decide that shadow I

249
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,800
could use evil we need to consolidate it

250
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,320
bring it into corporate and so there's a

251
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,899
corporate I.T which then starts to cycle

252
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,060
over again because the people in the

253
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,320
business don't feel like they're being

254
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,380
served and so they develop Shadow I.T so

255
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,120
Pfizer went through this process they

256
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,640
pulled everything everybody in and they

257
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,560
needed essentially sales managers or

258
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,899
account managers to be on the interface

259
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,420
between corporate I.T and the various

260
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,640
businesses Pfizer has three main

261
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,860
businesses there's r d sales and

262
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,080
marketing and everything else

263
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,660
which was HR legal law that kind of

264
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,260
stuff

265
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,320
and I could spell r d i could spell i t

266
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,959
so I got the job of being the account

267
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,600
manager between it and uh

268
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,480
and R D I would start as a scientist I

269
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,640
could speak I.T the first thing we did

270
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,160
was one of the big four firms that come

271
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,200
to Pfizer and said hey your support

272
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,660
costs are too high we could fix that for

273
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,940
you take away admin privileges from 40

274
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,620
of your population

275
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,959
and Senior Management I mean it was

276
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,339
Arthur Anderson or whatever they were

277
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,860
back then they paid the money he said

278
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,440
this is great so they started a project

279
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,620
how just I'm curious if you were given

280
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,959
the project of take away admin

281
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,839
privileges from 40 of the people I mean

282
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,579
ignore the fact that people are just

283
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,440
generally going to be pissed off at

284
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,200
losing things what's the problem with 40

285
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,560
of people not having adminant privileges

286
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,920
anybody

287
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,100
well maybe but let's let's say that it's

288
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,040
Bingo right and and they're going to be

289
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,740
if you have 40 40 of the people don't

290
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,660
have admin privileges

291
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,180
think you got a meeting of 10 people

292
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,100
randomly distributed

293
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,660
six of those people are going to have

294
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,279
admin privileges the other people the

295
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,680
other four are going to say hey

296
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,260
why does he have Abner villages it's not

297
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,339
going to work

298
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,200
so I only took the job if they said

299
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,360
we've take away admin privilege 90 of

300
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,980
the people and

301
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,860
add a customer's a customer satisfaction

302
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,060
measure

303
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,200
figured

304
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,000
we're going to take privileges away from

305
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,560
people

306
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,079
you know neutral is if they can be a

307
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,459
little we expect them to be a little bit

308
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:00,839
pissed off

309
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,839
so uh we had I had them

310
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,040
tell me

311
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,740
we set a goal jointly that 85 percent of

312
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,779
the people or more would say it doesn't

313
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,100
suck

314
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,860
right so neutral is positive and we we

315
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,839
hit that and that's just think about

316
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,519
that that's a security thing right

317
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,940
that's changing culture that is and I

318
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,920
ended up making friends with the IT

319
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,660
department they were not friends with

320
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,000
business back then I remember showing up

321
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,680
in uh we had to go to sandwich England

322
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,260
which is a major

323
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,120
major it's a cool facility oh you should

324
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,500
go if you ever get a chance because you

325
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,300
drive past the big airport that was used

326
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,820
for the bombers in World War II it's out

327
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,140
in the middle of the country but it's a

328
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,360
huge huge Runway so I went to sandwich

329
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,120
and I introduced my I.T partner as my

330
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,700
I.T partner and he almost

331
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,160
uh lost across his jaw on the floor

332
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,139
because they'd never been called friends

333
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,019
so um so this is that's how I got

334
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,720
started in cyber security I worked at

335
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,620
Pfizer I I uh got laid off in 2005

336
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,480
because

337
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,000
uh Pfizer downsized that they took over

338
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,100
too many companies so I got laid off I

339
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,899
took my retraining allowance I had

340
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,000
worked there for 27 years so I did get a

341
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,860
retraining allowance I took that and put

342
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,899
it all into work study with Sams

343
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,060
everybody served stands right

344
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,139
work study at that time was 500 dollars

345
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,019
you go a day early you had to you had to

346
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,720
stay in the the conference hotel but it

347
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,639
ended up being about

348
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,440
between two and three thousand dollars

349
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,480
per class and you've got the cert and

350
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,820
everything so using my retraining

351
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,220
allowance I managed to get

352
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,100
several search and I made myself useful

353
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,500
at Sans uh I would go to the conferences

354
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,540
and stay late

355
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,519
as work study you work you really worked

356
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,019
your butt off has anybody done work

357
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,760
study for Sans

358
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,100
no because it's a lot more expensive now

359
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,160
I think it's 3 000 or 3 500.

360
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,060
that's oh okay

361
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:03,620
7 500 for work study

362
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,839
yeah the the classes are the classes are

363
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,240
also expensive they were

364
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,579
about five thousand when when worst it

365
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,040
was 500 so it's really expensive to get

366
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,920
Sands training and I have uh something

367
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,980
like a dozen certs like I said I the

368
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,959
advice I have for you is not going to

369
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,160
work you got to find something else

370
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,839
there's other there's other ways to do

371
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,839
this so I worked for I got in very

372
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,660
involved in fans uh that got me a job

373
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,779
teaching at Purdue and Purdue Calumet at

374
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,279
the time they were trying to build a

375
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,440
computer security program and they

376
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,079
needed people with phds my PhD is in

377
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,220
chemical engineering doesn't have

378
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,260
anything to do with cyber security but I

379
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,880
know some cyber security by that time I

380
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,279
had sand search I had a CIS

381
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,380
so you know you kind of went your way

382
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,139
through the world I I got noticed

383
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,540
because I was tweeting of all things

384
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,300
there was a guy that the professor at

385
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,920
Purdue knows my tweets said hey

386
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,000
community

387
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,279
it was a terrible job it was too

388
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,740
hours from my house so I would drive

389
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,139
over and sleep and

390
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,139
for the week and then go back I did that

391
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,339
for two years and just couldn't take it

392
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,560
anymore but fortunately a guy named

393
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,120
Stephen Northcutt who was the time

394
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,360
president of Sands said hey I have

395
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,820
always wanted to to run a graduate

396
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,500
program and they're going to let me do

397
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,600
it would you come help me because you

398
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,920
have a PhD

399
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,899
so I said you know Stephen Northcutt

400
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,779
calls president Sans you don't you don't

401
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:31,920
say no

402
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,839
so I went and I did there for a couple

403
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,820
of years and we we spun up anybody have

404
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,079
a masters

405
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,639
here every once in a while I get some

406
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,079
money that has just joined the program

407
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,420
so I did that then they got

408
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,760
accreditation you don't need

409
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,420
high-powered people to if you're uh if

410
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,519
you're at accreditation

411
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,560
if you get accredited you're already

412
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,139
famous so nobody if you're thinking of

413
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,180
going to Sands now you're not asking are

414
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,399
they accredited and who's there right so

415
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,220
so they're accredited I left I was

416
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,079
looking for something to do there was

417
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,199
this I this idea of a bunch of cyber

418
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,899
civilians in Michigan and so that's how

419
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,579
I got into the Cyber civilian core

420
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:14,399
that's my background which is like not

421
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,560
starting off in cyber security

422
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,500
so among the signs

423
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,660
that you may see when you think you're

424
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,540
wired for a cyber security career uh is

425
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,639
this one and you should pay attention to

426
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,940
that one too uh but

427
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,760
that's how it started

428
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,899
I saw this slide and this just really

429
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,880
expresses my feeling these days

430
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,959
uh I am a dancer and well you know my

431
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,480
heart's been broken like if your heart's

432
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,399
not been broken uh you know let me let

433
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,899
me help you out with that

434
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,959
that's what makes you alive but there

435
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,120
there is supply chain and social

436
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,279
infrastructure collapse right I mean

437
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,440
look at us we're all in Mass we're all I

438
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,480
mean even having a mask on does make you

439
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,339
kind of kind of recoil from people a

440
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,799
little bit scary times this I got

441
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,619
stuff's on fire you heard of uh I am the

442
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:11,280
Cavalry of woods and Josh Corman

443
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,579
I did a talk at besides Las Vegas this

444
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,799
year and there was a track called um the

445
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,199
eye and the Cavalry track that was at

446
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,939
besides Las Vegas and this was one of

447
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,520
the themes that stuff is on fire so I

448
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,640
think this is really where I am it's

449
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,799
like I have all this stuff and I'm at a

450
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,760
certain age where I'm saying

451
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,919
this is it I don't have a gas mask on I

452
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,059
think we need

453
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:39,419
that um but if that is the case

454
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,460
how are we going to react and I'll just

455
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,380
tell you up front Mr Rogers is one of my

456
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,380
heroes so no making fun Mr Rogers is a

457
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,179
badass I don't

458
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,340
uh whether you've seen the movie or not

459
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,480
I have not but I know because I

460
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,220
I'm a member

461
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,679
an active member uh but an ordained

462
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,380
Elder in the Presbyterian church and Mr

463
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,140
Rogers was a presbyterian Minister he

464
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,059
got to be a presbyterian I don't care

465
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,220
what you think about religion but in the

466
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,320
Presbyterian Church you have to define a

467
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,720
group of people that that you go

468
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,679
that call you right Mr Rogers the the

469
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,799
the grand Presbyterian Church was

470
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,520
convinced by Mr Rogers that children are

471
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
a particular group of people that needs

472
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,539
a certain

473
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,000
way of addressing them I really want to

474
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
stay out of

475
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,860
it but he he identified a Target group

476
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,520
got a large organization to fund him to

477
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,919
support him to do this and so that's

478
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,799
really why he's my hero

479
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,860
he made it happen just and you know he

480
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,500
didn't beat anybody up Mr Rogers is like

481
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,179
the nicest guy so if you can make it

482
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,700
make it happen by by doing this it's

483
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,559
great so we

484
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,080
we look around we see the helpers we

485
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,059
help the helpers we are not the helpers

486
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,520
the helpers are a police fire you know

487
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,500
government that kind of thing we help

488
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,140
them and support public infrastructure

489
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,760
so in Michigan

490
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,260
who needs help

491
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,840
in Michigan there's 2500 public entities

492
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,360
this is we only deal with public

493
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,700
services okay Commercial Services

494
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,860
security is part of doing business

495
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,760
so you know if you screw up sorry

496
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,740
um but there's 2 500 local public

497
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,160
entities including cities counties

498
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,240
townships and school districts because

499
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,580
school districts are sometimes or

500
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,799
organized differently they they're a

501
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,419
special population and you know I like

502
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:39,179
Mr Rogers and he was about you so I

503
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,340
Healthcare shows up too but health care

504
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,660
tends to become

505
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,080
more so we have 2500 public entities do

506
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,840
you think there are 2500

507
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,900
I.T professionals to support I.T

508
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,539
departments in 2500 local entities I'll

509
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:55,559
tell you no

510
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,700
I think we think about 500 of those 2500

511
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,100
public entities have contracts with a

512
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,020
managed service providers many security

513
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,299
service providers many service security

514
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,280
you know mssp

515
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,559
so that leaves 2 000 of them that are

516
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,960
uncovered

517
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,760
there's another phrase from from Josh

518
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,600
Target Rich cyber poor this is a a graph

519
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,400
of the population of Michigan counties

520
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,980
by population and you can see e over on

521
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,600
the left is Wayne and McComb this

522
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,780
Detroit area there's Flint Lansing these

523
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,160
are you don't even live in Michigan and

524
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,020
most of the

525
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,280
se but you could probably name a half

526
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,559
dozen that's all

527
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,178
I hope you can name Kalamazoo now

528
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,340
but you see this long tail

529
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,679
the people managing the I.T departments

530
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,900
out here in

531
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,059
you know that's the kid that was the

532
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,520
best in the math class in high school

533
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,080
you know and he comes in and he gets

534
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,880
hired to spin up the website probably

535
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,440
got hired to spend at the website 20

536
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,020
years ago for the uh for the city

537
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,340
government

538
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,620
and and that's not making fun of any uh

539
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,480
bless their hearts you know for doing

540
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,580
that we've been in organizations where

541
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,320
they've been breached and people are

542
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,940
still coming to the I.T person asking

543
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,220
about password changes

544
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,280
so back in 2010

545
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,440
which was where Governor Rick Snyder

546
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,600
when Governor Rick Snyder was elected

547
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,880
and I know if you know Governor Snyder

548
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,440
it's for something else so just forget

549
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,799
about that because he his Twitter handle

550
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,679
is one tough nerd he did a good thing

551
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,840
for for Michigan I'm really happy he did

552
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,880
this uh he came up with the idea of

553
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,000
having a bunch of civilians who could

554
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,220
supplement State resources in the event

555
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,080
of a cyber emergency

556
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,900
so there was a bunch of

557
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,620
true I think 54 or five old white guys

558
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,480
got together and they had this Tech idea

559
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,820
but that's all there was I mean yeah

560
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,039
those were the people they did something

561
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,600
good okay

562
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,179
the the things that were in people's

563
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,120
heads at that time 2001 was the 911

564
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,140
attack

565
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,020
I you all were alive back then I

566
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,640
remember it was like it was like a huge

567
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,200
gut punch that lasted about a year

568
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,780
everybody was it was a terrible

569
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,940
Awakening we knew that the United States

570
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,320
was vulnerable and you started looking

571
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,539
around for for everything it was it was

572
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,100
it was really

573
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,799
um an Awakening to how vulnerable we are

574
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,860
in 2003 you might not remember

575
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,720
I remember it because I was at Cedar

576
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,640
Point with a bunch of high school kids

577
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,460
but the power went out all along the

578
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,159
northeastern Seaboard and uh if you were

579
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,720
to see your point I'm at the roller

580
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,220
coaster stopped at the very top of the

581
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,539
hill and people had to walk down and

582
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,039
they were sobbing and crying made a big

583
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:40,500
muscle impression turned out this was a

584
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,820
squirrel

585
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,400
but you know it really doesn't matter

586
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,919
because if you lose electricity

587
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,440
hospitals can't do surgery you know all

588
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,600
of those things so it was just a

589
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,720
reinforcement that we are vulnerable

590
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,780
in 2007 this was on purpose the

591
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,100
department of energy dragged an

592
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,020
electrical generator to Idaho

593
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,200
sent it a series of computer commands

594
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,840
and made it blow up and if you have not

595
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,340
seen this you should go find it on

596
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,840
YouTube

597
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,280
the generator just starts spinning

598
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,919
faster and faster and start smoking and

599
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,960
it it takes years to replace the

600
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,820
generator so you do that with a couple

601
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,100
of generators you're in big deep

602
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,320
and in Michigan we have the upper

603
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,539
peninsula if yours anybody do the the

604
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,880
Michigan map you know we have the upper

605
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,520
peninsula up here which is cold out here

606
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,039
I was just up there last week and uh

607
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,260
it's not very populated

608
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,720
and in Michigan the the governor

609
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,880
declares a cyber emergency when life is

610
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,520
a state people at life and limb are safe

611
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,460
so the Michigan the original goal of the

612
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,900
Michigan cyber civilian Corps was to

613
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,820
respond when the governor declares a

614
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,320
cyber emergency which means people are

615
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,480
in danger of dying that would be

616
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,520
electrical you know the electric power

617
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,679
going out right

618
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,840
right they also recognized that we had

619
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,000
trainable Workforce

620
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,760
Google has some stuff there and you know

621
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,280
the Auto industry was

622
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,260
not going great guns and we needed

623
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,700
something to do with all the technical

624
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,500
expertise we got University of Michigan

625
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,100
so how to use these resources uh we had

626
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,159
Merit was a one of the original

627
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,860
providers of the internet in North

628
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,600
America I'm pretty sure I don't know

629
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,760
this for sure but knowing about Merit

630
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,799
now I'm pretty sure that Merit probably

631
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,960
provided that internet service when I

632
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,659
was back at Purdue because they were

633
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,340
okay

634
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:37,039
excellent how do you would you

635
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,419
okay

636
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:40,919
there you go and so you know they

637
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,140
provided Purdue also

638
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,860
okay cool

639
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,380
so I I know that

640
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,419
um Merit was part of the nanog the North

641
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,200
American Network operator

642
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:00,120
yeah so they were the thing that was

643
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,419
happening was that nanog

644
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,400
internet was commodity

645
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,380
there was a guy from the defense

646
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,299
University in Washington DC named Joe

647
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,460
Adams that was from Michigan so they

648
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,159
hired Joe he was one of the group of all

649
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,659
black guys

650
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,000
um he wasn't that old but you know

651
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,520
so they they created a cyber range at

652
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,179
Merit they were going to take the uh the

653
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,340
not quite well enough trained people

654
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,799
within Michigan run through the Cyber

655
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,559
range train them up to be responders and

656
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,840
then we would have a Cadre of cyber

657
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,279
responders with Michigan

658
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,279
uh unfortunately

659
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,200
a couple of things

660
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,299
training people for an event where

661
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,760
people are in danger of dying it's kind

662
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,559
of hard to imagine the Cyber component

663
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,539
of that like what kind of packets do you

664
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:49,860
analyze

665
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,900
I I just couldn't figure out how we

666
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,640
would do that if you want to train for

667
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,520
your mission and I make fun of it but

668
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,559
like really when you get down to Brass

669
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,299
tax and you want to organize your group

670
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,520
and you have a goal if your goal is

671
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,200
responding to keep people from dying I

672
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,600
don't know how to do that with cyber but

673
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,659
there are other things we can do

674
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:13,440
uh we we also knew like there were a

675
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,679
handful of us that became members of the

676
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:18,360
Michigan cyber civilian Corps when it

677
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,279
was run by Merit and the way you became

678
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,480
a member back then was they did an

679
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,559
interview

680
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,360
and you had to have connections and like

681
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,360
I was a dean at Sand so it was

682
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,919
I mean it was pretty easy

683
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,840
so I became a member but there were some

684
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,400
of us that already had multiple sand

685
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,960
certifications and they were just

686
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,720
talking about the Merit cyber Rings they

687
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,179
were talking about like uh Global

688
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,400
Horizons New Horizons you know those

689
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,460
kind of level maybe CIA maybe SEC plus

690
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,620
training so it wasn't it wasn't as good

691
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,640
as we wanted

692
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,880
and also as we did some emergency early

693
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,659
response locals are not prepared at all

694
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:56,340
particularly when covid happened you

695
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,140
know how many of us are surprised that

696
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,220
there was RDP open to the internet

697
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,700
so in theory practices in the same

698
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,440
Theory but once we tried to turn the

699
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,120
theory into practice it didn't didn't

700
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,520
work we're seeing a lot more stuff like

701
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,080
this there's a college that's closed

702
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,820
down ransomware is all the big thing now

703
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,220
it's not attacking the power grid though

704
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,840
that does happen

705
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,799
but even on uh for those of you some if

706
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,120
you're in cyber security you listen to

707
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,279
something the Cyber wire security now

708
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,799
one of the podcasts and this is what

709
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,279
they're saying the ransomware uh is is

710
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,100
uh sort of tailing off a little bit now

711
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,260
but still we have some we have some work

712
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,700
to do

713
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,960
so looking at the thought process

714
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,299
there's a lot of things to do there's

715
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,419
response I mean you know the Mist

716
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:50,460
prepare oh what's picker I'll prepare

717
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,120
identify contain or eradicate

718
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,080
uh remediate and Lessons Learned and

719
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,720
this is very similar you know five four

720
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,480
or five six step process so we decided

721
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,039
that the first thing you want to do is

722
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,080
respond right if you get whacked you got

723
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,299
to have a response prepared so we

724
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,039
collaborated with Merit this was back in

725
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,020
2013 we created the Michigan cyber

726
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,500
civilian Corps I became a member in 2015

727
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,020
. we got lucky in 2015 because one of

728
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,659
those overqualified members was also the

729
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,880
deputy chief security officer for one of

730
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,580
the power companies in Michigan and one

731
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,340
of the old white guys uh when when the

732
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,440
governor changes every four years the

733
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,539
high-level people leave because they

734
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,760
they've been like the CIO of a state and

735
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,860
then they can go to a consulting company

736
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,080
and make lots of money so you get then

737
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,679
get the next the next crop of very

738
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,799
senior and Senior staff but then it's

739
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,380
like what's that British show Yes

740
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,360
Minister you know the technocrats are

741
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,640
always there I always always be there

742
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,419
but we lost the CTO

743
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,720
um so we got uh we got secunda the CSO

744
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,960
from a power company and he was cool and

745
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,299
he I don't know where he got money to

746
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:07,919
fund sandstream but we did our first

747
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,080
hand strain that year they tell me that

748
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,779
RFP is still floating out there but so I

749
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,460
don't know you know it's the vagaries of

750
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,080
the procurement process but we got sand

751
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,880
strings and that really turned the

752
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,320
corner on the Michigan cyber civility

753
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,840
Corps because it made it a thing

754
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,840
um Christian went off back to the power

755
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,279
company and I took over as the project

756
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,320
manager at that point

757
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,960
um we have now the Michigan cyber

758
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,779
civilian Act which is like I don't read

759
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,580
much legislation but I had to read this

760
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,919
in great detail because because we have

761
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,720
law we're subject to the oversight

762
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,340
Committee of the legislature and I know

763
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,159
way too much about legislation now but

764
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,620
it's a really good law it's like it's

765
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,659
only about three pages

766
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,940
the first page is definitions

767
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,740
and uh in the amendment in 2019 we got

768
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,520
the the government defined an incident

769
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,200
to include the existence of a

770
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,580
vulnerability

771
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,200
governments are great because they think

772
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,520
legislatures are great that can Define

773
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,740
things you may have you may remember

774
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,679
when Australia wanted to redefine pi to

775
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:15,000
be 3.14 I think and that they didn't let

776
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,100
them do that but they did let since this

777
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,500
is not math the legislature is able to

778
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,320
Define uh an incident to include the

779
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,120
existence of the vulnerability and if

780
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,240
you follow sisa you know cisa has a

781
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,980
catalog of known exploited

782
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,080
vulnerabilities so we have not done this

783
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,659
yet you just have the ability to do it

784
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:36,840
but now we could take the the exploited

785
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,600
vulnerability catalog work with our

786
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,220
local governments to see who needs

787
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,140
fixing and go out and begin to do that

788
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,899
so that's our next

789
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,820
proactive uh

790
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,580
activities are our next goal right now

791
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,500
we are just a responsible

792
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,039
we currently have 64 mic3 members and

793
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:59,399
most of them are sort of are have a

794
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,880
certification that is covered under DOD

795
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,659
8570 which I think is 8410 now but it is

796
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,520
the legislation that says you can work

797
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,100
on a cyber uh project for the US

798
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,940
government

799
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,580
we have I don't really care about this

800
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,120
but we have to hook up to other people's

801
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,500
licensing and accreditation validation

802
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,840
programs because I don't want to write

803
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,779
uh accreditation

804
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:27,419
so uh benefits obviously there's

805
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,520
training okay we have people that work

806
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,720
for small companies that would never

807
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,399
send them to sanskrain strength and we

808
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,380
don't do I I'm not guaranteeing that

809
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,580
we're going to get this Dance Training

810
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,620
again I think personally I think sand

811
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,899
straining is

812
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:42,179
overpriced and I also know for a fact

813
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:43,980
that there's training out there now that

814
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,840
is

815
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,659
uh employers like for a small business

816
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:50,940
if they have a member and that member

817
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,279
goes off to receive Sands training or

818
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,840
Black Hills training or whatever we're

819
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,240
doing at the at the point that's that

820
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,340
employer is going to benefit also so we

821
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,200
let their employer and employee go for a

822
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,340
little bit we're going to train them up

823
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,620
and send them back and that adds to the

824
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,520
Cyber uh the level of cyber security

825
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,840
within the state and we're all about

826
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,659
like you know if your neighbor is

827
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:15,960
vulnerable You're vulnerable too

828
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,299
uh we are included in the state cyber

829
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:20,100
response plan this or cyber disruption

830
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,200
response plan which you can find on the

831
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,120
internet um probably other states have

832
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,980
theirs too the the there's some parts

833
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,600
that are confidential but we're in there

834
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,799
we do tabletop exercises we have helped

835
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,600
to uh show the state that they need to

836
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,340
do a little bit

837
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,039
we did a multi-site tabletop recently

838
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,320
and in the state emergency Ops Center

839
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,760
they were sort of running into each

840
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,340
other like the Keystone Cops and again

841
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,919
I'm not making fun because every State's

842
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:48,960
going to be like that but if you make

843
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,760
people bump into each other they go oh

844
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,580
my nose hurts I better have a plan so

845
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,020
then they start paying attention we have

846
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,779
a much better plan now uh we hope we're

847
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:58,980
going to be able to participate with

848
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,720
cyber Shield this year the National

849
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,080
Guard exercise was 50 teams our his

850
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,779
training history we started off with uh

851
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,820
security 504 and I put the Sans numbers

852
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,500
up here I'll tell you what they are but

853
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,679
sand security 504 is sort of the basic

854
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,320
uh incident response process if we're

855
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,580
going to do incident response that's

856
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,779
where I got to pick are all

857
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,880
remediate Lessons Learned

858
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,419
so 504 is sort of the basic incident

859
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:31,080
response training from Sands we did 510

860
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,419
which is continuous monitoring

861
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:34,980
so if you're going to go in and look at

862
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,720
a network you kind of want to know

863
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,399
what's normal because you have to be

864
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,380
able to

865
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,779
end taking a course doesn't tell you

866
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:44,880
what's normal on a network but it tells

867
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,260
you where to go to look for what is

868
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,460
normal

869
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,860
if and I you know I I wish it were the

870
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,200
case that if you had 510 training you

871
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,820
can come into a local government and say

872
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,820
hi tell me about these five aspects and

873
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,260
the person there is going to tell you

874
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,620
and they're going to most likely say um

875
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,919
our room but if if we know what to look

876
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,899
for we can come and come and look we

877
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:08,639
then did do Network forensics if you've

878
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,000
ever used the

879
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,379
what is the soft elk

880
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:16,980
this is an elk stack that uh Phil Hagan

881
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,060
has put together for the network

882
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,739
forensics class highly recommend this

883
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:22,918
class it really I

884
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:25,918
I went through training and got really

885
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,719
interested in endpoint forensics but

886
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,300
Network forensics is where it's at you

887
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,580
you know you can solve a problem a lot

888
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,339
faster with network forensics and by the

889
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,440
time you got a disc image you can have

890
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,780
information from the logs so we don't do

891
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,659
a lot of of endpoint forensics but I do

892
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:44,520
have members that really want to do that

893
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,580
and I'll speak from I spent uh several

894
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,560
days over in Wisconsin Wisconsin has an

895
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,560
incident response team too and they have

896
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,260
the same issue they have

897
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,839
a large number of people and a small

898
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,580
minority want to do memory forensics

899
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,220
because it's cool but it doesn't really

900
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,400
help incident response so I I said

901
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,020
earlier that one of the benefits we

902
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,660
provide for for Citizens and employers

903
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,300
is training and I don't want to restrict

904
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,880
that to things that we use

905
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,460
that we must use like I want to leave

906
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,500
room for some esoteric advanced stuff

907
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,320
but I'm not quite sure what to do within

908
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,880
quite forensics yet

909
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,460
we did when we wanted to take a break

910
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,900
from Sands the fourth year we did

911
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,760
security onion training I'm sure you're

912
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,339
all familiar with that uh you may not be

913
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,480
familiar with Chris Sanders

914
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,820
investigative Theory class if you're not

915
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,859
familiar with Chris Sanders he's like

916
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:39,900
one of the wisest people in information

917
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,920
security

918
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,820
seriously go to chrissanders.org he got

919
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,500
he just not

920
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,740
I didn't he just got his doctorate but

921
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,480
it's in education

922
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,660
and he wrote Chris wrote uh Advanced

923
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,599
packet analysis and he's a cyber guy for

924
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,040
sure but he got his degree in education

925
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,440
because he studied about how stock

926
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,900
analysts make decisions and we did this

927
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,240
investigative Theory class it was it was

928
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,040
really excellent we went through

929
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,579
scenarios and you saw how we are all

930
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:14,220
tempted to jump to conclusions and go

931
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,400
down the uh an unproductive path for too

932
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,440
long highly recommend this class I think

933
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,119
you can take it online now

934
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,640
we are currently using a company called

935
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,359
rangeforce and again I I tell them I'm a

936
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,040
contractor so I cannot speak for the

937
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,780
state of Michigan but I'll just tell you

938
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,180
personally I love I like the rangeforce

939
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,680
platform a lot

940
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,079
it does not have

941
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,900
um the rock stars like Sans has had you

942
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,280
know it's not in-person training it's

943
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,320
read the stuff but they do a real good

944
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,880
job of spinning up

945
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,619
um virtual machines

946
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:48,720
and so you can read about something do

947
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,000
an exercise and get immediate feedback I

948
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,859
like it a lot and it's reasonably priced

949
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:55,680
so I along with black hills information

950
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,800
security and anti-siphon is their

951
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,099
training piece now I just think there's

952
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:03,900
nothing against Sans but I don't want to

953
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,940
give somebody my money if I don't have

954
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,859
to so this is the training we've done

955
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,540
we're sticking with rangeforce for right

956
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,180
now uh rangeforce has the ability to do

957
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,119
challenges so about three weeks ago I

958
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,880
got three teams of people together uh

959
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,540
they studied some modules around 40 OS

960
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,420
and Splunk so then we had a scenario

961
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,119
where we had to respond in the course of

962
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,740
a couple of hours and find out what was

963
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,900
going on it was a battle

964
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,020
thing but it's worth that was a great

965
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,940
exercise plus it got everybody together

966
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,099
in the same room for the first time two

967
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:40,859
years awesome additional benefits I

968
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,079
talked to our to my members

969
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:44,940
at least once a year to have a

970
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,320
one-on-one

971
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,500
that's not very much but as I do that 85

972
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,240
of our members have changed jobs in the

973
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,280
last two years and I know that's because

974
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,839
they know more

975
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,359
we have a group now so they can talk to

976
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,160
each other if somebody uses a job they

977
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,200
they tell each other we have a slack

978
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,000
Channel and the jobs

979
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,520
channel is pretty busy

980
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,180
we do K-12 involvement uh Merit used to

981
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,200
run a high school cyber challenge

982
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,060
they're not going to again after this

983
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,160
year but there are other competitions

984
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,140
that are out there and I do try to get

985
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,619
members like we members we have members

986
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:20,880
all through the

987
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,700
of all ages very diverse well not as

988
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,880
diverse gender and racist I'd like but

989
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,240
we have people in All Phases of life

990
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,920
sometimes you know the kids are they got

991
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,599
soccer and so people can't respond for a

992
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,220
while a digital one person that got

993
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,320
diagnosed with cancer and is out with

994
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,140
chemo for a while so it's it's like life

995
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,900
but as we get people involved in the

996
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,760
Cyber Corps they take that they take

997
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,440
their cyber security training back into

998
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,380
their regular life and so we get we

999
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,300
actually have an effect in high schools

1000
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,900
and 12. we have Civic involvement I just

1001
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,700
had one of my members just while I was

1002
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,500
up preparing for this sent a picture of

1003
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,020
uh or post a picture on LinkedIn of

1004
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,599
himself and his Deputy Reserve deputies

1005
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,839
uh uniform because he works with his

1006
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:09,359
local law enforcement we have adjunct

1007
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,720
professors I think the same guys I

1008
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,180
get people who are overachievers and the

1009
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,980
people

1010
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,440
diversity is wonderful we have a DHS

1011
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,460
Grant in Michigan to

1012
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,260
and we put together a contract with a

1013
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,880
marketing company so they have some

1014
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,320
posters that we're going to send out to

1015
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,020
Kenny Clarks and if I can get my members

1016
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,720
to show up we don't currently have badge

1017
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,680
badge or something if if I so I if I

1018
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,960
could get badges I I would have some of

1019
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,400
our members have badges and go stand

1020
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,260
with Representatives talking about

1021
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,480
elections being secure but anything that

1022
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,180
will will increase trust in the

1023
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,920
government in institutions I think is a

1024
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,339
good thing our main our main goal is to

1025
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:57,839
deal with cyber threat

1026
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,720
but cyber threats are built on top of

1027
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,940
threats to the to the underlying

1028
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,900
infrastructure

1029
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,140
so we we have to address that as well do

1030
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,339
you want to be a member now that you're

1031
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,079
all excited you have to have two years

1032
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,320
of infosec one foundational security

1033
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,839
certification some demonstrated

1034
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,820
knowledge and we do we do have some

1035
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,520
tests I don't like them very much and

1036
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,960
want to move away from them but they

1037
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,180
they work and they gave us the uh the

1038
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,800
group that we have today

1039
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,920
we asked for 10 days of possible

1040
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,540
participation but that includes about

1041
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,760
six of training and I don't think we've

1042
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,640
ever actually had 10 days of

1043
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,200
administrative stuff that doesn't

1044
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,359
include deployments

1045
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:44,060
we've had uh probably a double handful

1046
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,780
and

1047
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,500
oh

1048
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,400
damn pop-ups

1049
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:56,099
and you have to have a federal

1050
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:58,260
background check an FBI criminal

1051
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,900
background check because

1052
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,760
the law says that I don't think it's

1053
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,440
really necessary but theoretically

1054
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,960
possible that somebody responding to a

1055
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,579
breach of a local government could be

1056
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:09,960
exposed to the criminal justice

1057
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,140
information system or sieges and they

1058
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,940
didn't want convicted felons having

1059
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,800
access

1060
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,339
so the one thing that we did get changed

1061
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,740
when we got our law amended to say the

1062
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,859
background check here's the story uh you

1063
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,660
know when the governor signs a bill into

1064
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,040
law they always have a bunch of people

1065
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,440
standing behind right and the governor

1066
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,060
well if you're the president you hold up

1067
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,380
the signature but

1068
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,599
the governor just signed signed the

1069
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,400
Michigan cyber civilian Act

1070
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,180
oh sure yeah and uh and then you know

1071
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,619
they they reached around to hand the pen

1072
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:46,560
to somebody we could only get one person

1073
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,560
one member there to to sit with the

1074
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,079
governor when he signed the bill so that

1075
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,020
guy took the pen went home you know I

1076
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,820
was very happy we started implementing

1077
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,920
the law did federal background checks

1078
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,859
guess who failed that guy

1079
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:03,660
federal background check will pick up

1080
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,180
youthful offender so if you're like I

1081
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,560
don't know the details of the the

1082
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,920
federal youthful offender program but it

1083
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,960
happens you know people make mistakes

1084
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,900
and so they they they'll tell you your

1085
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,760
record will be expunged

1086
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,119
well you know it's expunged but it still

1087
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,200
shows up so we got actually I I don't

1088
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,880
really want to say his name but we have

1089
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,240
his amendment to our law because we now

1090
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,820
have advisors if you don't pass the

1091
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,859
federal background check you can appeal

1092
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:37,020
to our Advisory Board

1093
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,440
so I I made it up we got an amendment

1094
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,020
at least I don't have

1095
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,119
uh can you give me

1096
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:49,079
what

1097
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:51,960
no signal

1098
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,680
that's weird

1099
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,040
okay well

1100
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,900
um let me I'll just tell you then we

1101
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,980
have you have to do the federal

1102
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,560
background check in order to apply to be

1103
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,940
a member you go to our website

1104
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,220
you create a my login in Michigan every

1105
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,660
everything starts with Mi so it's

1106
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,660
pronounced my so it's your login uh you

1107
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,540
access the mic3 app you take some tests

1108
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,480
we have these uh three types of tests

1109
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,160
five tests total

1110
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,440
if you pass Network forensic Network

1111
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,240
fundamentals you get access to the other

1112
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,160
two and then you have to pass four of

1113
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,319
the five tests

1114
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:34,680
once you do that you submit your MDA or

1115
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,859
you sign an NDA and do the fingerprint

1116
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:40,260
authorization we do that last because we

1117
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,400
don't want to do fingerprints on

1118
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,420
somebody that doesn't have

1119
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,020
certifications and experience

1120
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,000
the activities we do we have monthly

1121
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,060
update meetings and I'm going to and now

1122
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,400
I'm going to start getting cpes for that

1123
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,460
uh training we do rangeforce we have

1124
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,220
face-to-face meetings as often as we can

1125
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,020
does everybody know about gercon

1126
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,560
in Grand Rapids it is a bit a bit larger

1127
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,420
than Circle

1128
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,359
I anytime you see a like if Derby con

1129
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:15,920
comes back it's a Midwest con Go please

1130
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,380
so operations the way we get deployed a

1131
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,520
victim organization will call

1132
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,660
1-877-mi fiber

1133
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,760
they see something is something they

1134
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,920
call that number one of the members of

1135
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,079
the Michigan cyber uh cyber command

1136
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:32,400
which is part of the Michigan State

1137
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,579
Police law enforcement will evaluate the

1138
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,220
issue and sometimes they take care of

1139
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,760
everything I I hope we can change that

1140
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,359
the way it is

1141
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,560
involved earlier

1142
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,079
and if they need civilian help we do a

1143
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:50,819
three-way handshake with attorney

1144
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:53,339
general approved documentation and it's

1145
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:56,160
a pain in the butt but we can be

1146
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,540
deployed

1147
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,540
response targets are like this similar

1148
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,339
to a small and medium business we have

1149
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:05,160
you know generally this is this is not a

1150
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,540
description of anything this is to give

1151
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,880
you an idea of size

1152
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,040
lots of external connections also local

1153
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,240
government will have connections for

1154
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,859
Friend of the Court

1155
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:16,200
um the criminal justice you know lots of

1156
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,940
other things

1157
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,200
um so we I'm gonna blow through this

1158
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,060
that's all reactive

1159
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,240
I have a partner in the government Andy

1160
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,079
brush

1161
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,660
who used to be a local goat like I used

1162
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,880
to be a computer security guy and I

1163
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,040
created a bunch of group for hackers

1164
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,180
because I because that's what I like to

1165
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,839
do I love packets so I created a group

1166
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,480
to laugh at my jokes essentially and

1167
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,520
Andy used to be a local government I.T

1168
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,140
official he used to work for Ann Arbor

1169
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,760
which is where University of Michigan is

1170
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,280
a big big city so he was a local I.T

1171
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,960
government guy he now works for the

1172
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,520
state helping local I.T government

1173
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,060
people prevent attacks this is the Cyber

1174
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,440
Partners meeting you can see where

1175
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,180
people come from we even got some people

1176
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,780
from Wisconsin Indianapolis this is the

1177
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,060
um the Indiana ice pack has been talking

1178
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,460
to us about forming an Indiana cyber

1179
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,560
civilian Court

1180
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,200
so you should build a strong team to to

1181
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,079
be cyber secure this is all the logos it

1182
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,119
does not have emic3 logo up there I

1183
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:19,980
stole the slide from Andy and so I'm

1184
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,180
gonna have to yell at him because he

1185
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,940
needs my logo but we have sisa kind of

1186
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,460
cheating for putting DHS up there uh

1187
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,520
these are all the folks we we work with

1188
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,040
FBI National Guard Wisconsin has a

1189
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,119
really good one

1190
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,400
uh I say that because I was just there

1191
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,200
and I I they're the only ones that I

1192
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,640
have a close

1193
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,680
but I think they're probably the closest

1194
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,440
to us and since there are two people in

1195
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,420
FEMA region five I'm pretty sure FEMA

1196
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,880
region five is Ohio Illinois Michigan

1197
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,400
Indiana

1198
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,520
uh Wisconsin and Minnesota

1199
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,060
and I don't think Illinois has one Ohio

1200
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:02,099
does uh they they're more with the uh

1201
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:04,440
with the National Guard

1202
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,040
Texas has one they are not allowed to

1203
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,599
call them anything that sounds military

1204
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,099
because the text the Texas Rangers

1205
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,380
didn't like that but they did steal some

1206
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,920
of our legislation and my my nephew is

1207
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,420
Chief of Staff for attended Texas

1208
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,760
legislator so I've been on the phone

1209
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,619
with Texas people I think they'll do

1210
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:25,920
something so we have a half dozen states

1211
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,900
it was happening the national Governors

1212
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,140
Association had us at their cyber

1213
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,000
Symposium meeting in Columbus back in

1214
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,540
June uh it had me uh speaking for the

1215
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,020
Michigan seesaw who couldn't make it

1216
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,420
Wisconsin and Ohio and it was that we

1217
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,880
had a huge amount of response I think

1218
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,700
this is this kind of idea has the

1219
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,740
majority it's being put into place other

1220
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,619
states and if you as a cyber security

1221
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,300
person

1222
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,040
feel like you can help your community

1223
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,079
this is what you want to look for and as

1224
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,119
I said no there's a guy named Tad Stahl

1225
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,940
who works in Indiana's office of

1226
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,700
Technology it's a state organization and

1227
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,099
I did not tell him before I said his

1228
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:09,599
name that I was going to say it but I

1229
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,480
did write to him before I came here and

1230
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,700
so if we can get something spun up in

1231
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,040
Indiana I would love love to do love to

1232
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,319
have Hoosier hackers because you know

1233
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:21,540
you've already got a motto right

1234
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,599
so build resilient social infrastructure

1235
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:27,140
this is what I do when I'm not hacking

1236
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,560
uh that is really me I'm a dancer and um

1237
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,099
when I worked at Pfizer so when the

1238
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:36,660
vaccines came out I mean I'm in

1239
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,480
Kalamazoo right so and I work for the

1240
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,880
state so I am deep state so I had to go

1241
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,480
volunteer uh and do vaccines but but

1242
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,520
meet people where they are if you if you

1243
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,460
are a cyber person take hybridness

1244
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,680
into the public you know I talk to

1245
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,599
parents at dance class they ask me what

1246
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,119
I do when I'm not dancing I told you

1247
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,099
know what I do same way with vaccination

1248
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:01,380
I talk to thousands of people when they

1249
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,240
came through to get their vaccines so

1250
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,920
they heard the word cyber whether it did

1251
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,720
good I don't know but

1252
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,700
we have to focus stuff and the general

1253
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,720
stuff

1254
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,520
that's where I have any questions

1255
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,839
additions yes sir

1256
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,119
found it

1257
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,359
I

1258
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:55,220
um

1259
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,920
I've been around so a year ago if you

1260
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,359
had said that I would have told you

1261
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:02,220
reasons why we can't do that and I can

1262
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,440
still think of those reasons however

1263
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,760
it's a good idea I mean it really is uh

1264
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,920
challenges

1265
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,560
and one of the challenges we have in

1266
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,660
responding is that local entities are

1267
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,859
independent

1268
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,859
and so we could set up like the state

1269
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:22,200
could set up a bug Bounty program and

1270
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,640
the state does get reports of

1271
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,560
vulnerabilities and I don't think we pay

1272
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,460
money but I don't know

1273
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,280
oh

1274
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,440
well if it's elections that that might

1275
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,800
be different

1276
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,579
right

1277
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:41,520
yes so um you're thinking in the right

1278
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,920
in the right place there's not a good

1279
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,980
answer packaged answer for that but that

1280
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,180
is the kind of thinking that we're all

1281
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,579
doing uh the the infrastructure

1282
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:54,720
investment and jobs act iija the notice

1283
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,640
of funding opportunity no follow just

1284
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,260
came out so we're going to be writing

1285
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,260
proposals there's a Homeland Grant uh

1286
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,760
Homeland Security Grant I've been trying

1287
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,400
to get some money from but currently we

1288
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,099
have the staff is me and I'm half time

1289
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:11,040
so it's over well I do have a I do have

1290
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,020
a project

1291
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,240
but we're working on it and one thing

1292
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,380
I'm trying to do is to get people

1293
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,059
excited so thank you for being for me

1294
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:20,400
excited it may not be happening today

1295
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,859
but it will and I put my contact

1296
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:25,440
information up here if Ray Davidson on

1297
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,700
Twitter you can find it yes

1298
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,540
I my I did not see the legislation I

1299
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,300
hear that they they submitted

1300
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,940
legislation I guess it would be in the

1301
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,780
house

1302
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,900
remember how how Indiana works but it

1303
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,480
didn't it didn't pass and I I don't

1304
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,040
think that's a bad thing but because it

1305
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,079
was pretty rushed

1306
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,079
um but I think it'll come back up again

1307
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:56,940
I don't know how the legislation works

1308
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,180
but we we are like I know Wisconsin has

1309
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,859
a mature program we're both looking at

1310
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:05,339
Indiana to say hey you guys are next

1311
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:07,440
so we're gonna gonna do what we can

1312
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,300
because Purdue's here too

1313
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,839
yes

1314
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,020
yes

1315
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,300
um we have we do it

1316
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,540
the in the Michigan State Police the guy

1317
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,540
that runs the Cyber Command Center is

1318
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,839
he has the philosophical approach also

1319
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,000
that they're not out to be law

1320
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,280
enforcement they're out to protect

1321
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,740
from cyber attacks and so they don't

1322
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,780
tell people and we have Good Samaritan

1323
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,460
law we have

1324
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,440
a confidential disclosure lots of kinds

1325
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,859
of things within

1326
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:57,780
so the the Cyber the state police was

1327
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:00,720
already poised to to do this local

1328
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,460
governments you're right I live in

1329
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,520
Kalamazoo and it's still a bunch in

1330
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,760
a bunch of all white guys and I I'm an

1331
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,260
old white guy too but I'm not one of

1332
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,819
them

1333
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:13,740
well it does though like

1334
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,460
well I I mean I'd long hair

1335
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,079
I'm not former law enforcement you know

1336
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:22,680
so it is but I know that the thing that

1337
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,940
I'm very excited about with the

1338
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,040
Wisconsin is that we sometimes we

1339
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,839
believe that if cyber insurance comes in

1340
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,339
we can't do anything

1341
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,200
Wisconsin has been able to work with

1342
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,180
cyber insurance so they can cooperate

1343
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,960
and so that's what I'm excited about

1344
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,359
um working with them and I think I'm

1345
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,700
going to get the hook here

1346
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,220
so you know clap and I'll talk to you as

1347
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,520
I come
