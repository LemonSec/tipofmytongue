1
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,680
first off I want to say thank you to

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,060
everyone for having me here I'm from

3
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,560
Detroit so I'm a fellow midwesterner

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,580
this is my first time in Indianapolis

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,439
and my first time at this Con and

6
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,199
everyone's been super welcoming and kind

7
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,820
and literally I walked in not knowing

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,559
one person and I now have like five new

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,079
friends so this has been awesome so far

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,180
a little bit about myself my name is

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,700
Caitlin kiska I'm a senior Cesar Analyst

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,160
at a very large retailer I've worked as

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,719
a threat intelligence engineer and

14
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,640
before that like a lot of people I got

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,640
my start in a sock specifically an mssp

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,780
sock

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,160
um and that's where I really started

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,960
getting involved with researching alert

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,780
fatigue because I was suffering from it

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,520
um in my spare time I'm an obsessive

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,559
bird watcher I've seen like 1200 species

22
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,660
of birds worldwide I like to travel to

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,119
seabirds and I went to Arctic Norway a

24
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,560
couple months ago for bird watching and

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,479
that's where that was taken and I'm at

26
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,460
the gambling bird on Twitter if you want

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,780
to torture yourself and follow me on

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,640
Twitter

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,860
but to the topic at hand

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,100
so what is alert Teague alert fatigue is

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,720
when an overwhelming number of alerts

32
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,759
desensitize the people who are tasked

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,080
with responding to them

34
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,420
it causes alerts to be missed malicious

35
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,640
activity to be labeled as normal and

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,860
responses to be delayed and overall

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,020
whether you're in cyber security

38
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,220
Transportation industrial control

39
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,380
systems or in health care it's a source

40
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,600
of human error and this last bullet

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,400
point can't be underestimated alert

42
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,340
fatigue can cause burnout anxiety and

43
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,680
huge amounts of stress which it's very

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,939
unfortunate for the people who are

45
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,560
undergoing it but it's also bad for your

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,880
organization because it leads to

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,520
turnover which we'll talk about shortly

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,680
and the reason we're here today is to

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,880
talk about why alert fatigue is

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,040
dangerous alert fatigue is dangerous to

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,240
the companies we're trying to protect

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,740
and the missions we are trying to

53
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,079
accomplish and in multiple Industries

54
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,880
alert fatigue is the root cause of death

55
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,280
and large-scale disaster uh in

56
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,899
Industrial Systems alert fatigue has

57
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,340
been linked to multiple large-scale

58
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,379
disasters which have killed hundreds of

59
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,879
people and cost hundreds of millions of

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,980
dollars in healthcare it kills people

61
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,540
every single year which is why they're

62
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,760
really proactive with combating it and

63
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,440
it's why in both Industries they've

64
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,700
actually started studying at really

65
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,680
really intensely since the 90s and it's

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,780
something that we can learn from and

67
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,879
just really quick aside here I didn't

68
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,739
want to make this a talk on the history

69
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,080
of industrial disasters which in and of

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,300
itself is very interesting but if you

71
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,920
actually want um when we have time at

72
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,180
the end if anyone has questions about

73
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,860
like in a granular level how alert

74
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,420
fatigue has led to Industrial disasters

75
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,640
or problems in health care I'm happy to

76
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,920
speak about that as well but since

77
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,080
they've been um researching alert

78
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,400
fatigue in these different Industries

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,860
since the 90s what they found is that

80
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,480
when analysts are suffering from alert

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,580
fatigue the alerts stop signaling that

82
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,680
something is wrong and instead the

83
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,480
overwhelming amount of alerts becomes

84
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,580
background noise and the analysts start

85
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,019
perceiving this as part of just their

86
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,580
normal working environment

87
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,040
and alarms and alerts they exist to

88
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,420
highlight deviations from a

89
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,940
predetermined normal status but when the

90
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,680
alarms themselves become normal they

91
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,659
stop enhancing safety and start putting

92
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,120
it at risk so how does alert fatigue

93
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,580
devolve into Danger

94
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,680
since they've studied alert alert

95
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,620
fatigue much more deeply in different

96
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,019
Industries they have a lot more granular

97
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,000
vernacular in order to be able to talk

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,159
about it and one of the things that they

99
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,720
talk about a lot which is extremely

100
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,280
dangerous is something called alert

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,300
override

102
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,340
and in alerting systems which are badly

103
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,159
designed and badly tuned a high value a

104
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,720
high volume of low Fidelity alerts

105
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,459
evolves into something called nuisance

106
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,260
alarms and that's actually the technical

107
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,780
term a nuisance alarm nuisance alarms

108
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,799
are traditionally what we would call

109
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,080
false positives in cyber security and

110
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
too many can cause someone to disregard

111
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,280
the danger an alert is trying to signal

112
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,959
and multiple Studies have shown that

113
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,340
when someone is presented with too many

114
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,239
alert

115
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,519
um excuse me too many nuisance alarms it

116
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:03,780
results in the person manually

117
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,599
overriding automated controls and in

118
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,280
cyber security we don't have a ton of

119
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,439
automated controls right now so how it

120
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,239
actually ends up manifesting itself in

121
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,939
socks or on IR teams is people will

122
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,339
disregard the alert at all either they

123
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,478
won't investigate it or they won't

124
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,100
really take it seriously

125
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,899
and one of the root causes of alert

126
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,759
override is that due to an overwhelming

127
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,860
amount of false positives the analyst

128
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,540
basically loses trust in the system

129
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,759
that's set up to assist them and instead

130
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,560
they develop this habit over time that

131
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,120
they don't need to investigate an alert

132
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,860
and they just this leads them to

133
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,860
diagnose malicious activity as normal

134
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,900
and again it's this lack of trust in the

135
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,479
system and this habitual disregarding of

136
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,120
an alert over and over and over again

137
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,440
that causes the analyst to make a

138
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,540
mistake and disregard the danger an

139
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,639
alert is trying to signal

140
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,280
and at its core that's what we are here

141
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,259
to talk about today we're trying to talk

142
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,180
about Engineering Systems where people

143
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,220
make less mistakes and we have to

144
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,720
remember that no matter what industry

145
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,639
we're in alert fatigue is a source of

146
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,979
human error we can't change the human

147
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,900
condition that humans will occasionally

148
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,300
make mistakes but we can change the

149
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,979
condition conditions under which people

150
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,720
work and ensure they're working in

151
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,100
environments where they make less

152
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,500
mistakes and in the second half of our

153
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,940
talk we're going to share some lessons

154
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,440
from other industries that can help us

155
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,419
design processes and programs which are

156
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:22,680
geared towards people making less

157
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,840
mistakes but first we're going to look

158
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,060
at two more granular ways that alert

159
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,800
fatigue helps programs devolve into

160
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,259
dangerous situations

161
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,000
one of these is something called an

162
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,320
alert flood

163
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,000
an alert plot is when analysts receive

164
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,460
such a high volume of alerts at one time

165
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,780
they cannot reasonably prioritize detect

166
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,759
diagnose or respond to what's going on

167
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,940
and other Industries see alert floods as

168
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,280
so dangerous that in transportation and

169
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,860
an industrial Control Systems they set a

170
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,020
hard cap at the amount of alerts one

171
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,580
person can look at at one time because

172
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,620
they realize there's no possible way if

173
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,000
someone gets 100 alerts they can

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,100
diagnose detect and respond in an

175
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,360
efficient manner with what's going on

176
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,400
and we can't really we don't have the

177
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,860
luxury of doing this in cyber security

178
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,060
try to tell a sock manager that we have

179
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,560
to set a hard cap of alerts that someone

180
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,780
can look at they'll laugh at you but um

181
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,860
this is something that again is

182
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,180
extremely dangerous in multiple

183
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,860
Industries and they take very seriously

184
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,740
and just kind of like a little example I

185
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,419
want to give here because the other

186
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,819
problem with alert excuse me with alert

187
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,639
floods is they caused the analysts to be

188
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,440
distracted by the or from their initial

189
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,340
task

190
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,919
and I want you to imagine that you are

191
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,120
doing

192
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,100
time sensitive detail-oriented work

193
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,620
which most work in cyber security is now

194
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,500
does anyone here have a chat in their

195
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,880
phone besides me please raise your hand

196
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,160
if so that you've had to mute like with

197
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,020
family members or something with slack

198
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,819
something like that I want you to

199
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,380
imagine and you're doing time sensitive

200
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,900
detail-oriented work I take your phone I

201
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,300
turn on an alert for every email every

202
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,460
text everything in your entire phone

203
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,960
your fantasy football team every time

204
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,699
someone scores a point and I put it in

205
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,500
your pocket and I say get to work and

206
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,940
you have to actually look at every

207
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,319
single one of the alerts while you're

208
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,600
doing detail-oriented time-sensitive

209
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,340
work we can all see how this could cause

210
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,360
a problem and you're not going to be

211
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,220
working your best

212
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,660
um but so every time again there's an

213
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,460
alert flawed you're inhibiting the

214
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,380
ability of analysts to diagnose any

215
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,940
malicious behavior that's going on at

216
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,860
the same time and these need to be

217
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,319
avoided at all costs we're going to talk

218
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,300
about some very granular ways for how to

219
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,220
do that later on

220
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,039
now both these situations nuisance

221
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,960
alarms and alert floods they're

222
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,360
stressful and alert fatigue is also

223
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
dangerous because as we will see shortly

224
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,500
it contributes to a painful working

225
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,259
environment in the sock this exacerbates

226
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,060
turnover which is a problem in our

227
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,340
industry as a whole but I think we all

228
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,440
know too it's kind of commonly

229
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,840
understood sock work and IR work is hard

230
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,240
it's stressful we have a huge turnover

231
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,039
problem specifically in stocks and IR

232
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,319
because we all know it's stressful and

233
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,180
the Pokemon Institute in my home state

234
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,740
of Michigan they went a little bit into

235
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,139
why this actually is

236
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,840
um the Pokemon Institute asked 15

237
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,759
000 which is a lot of people a lot of

238
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,020
different stock analysts what makes

239
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,440
working in a sock painful and 40 on a

240
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,720
scale of one to ten said that working in

241
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,220
a stock is so painful they rate it a

242
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,500
nine out of ten that's crazy

243
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,400
so 72 total rated the pain of working in

244
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,220
a stock at seven or higher and I think

245
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,560
we can all see how this could cause a

246
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,060
turnover situation no one wants to work

247
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,039
somewhere that they find painful High

248
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,539
turnover is something that's called a

249
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,039
latent condition

250
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,719
that's an underlying condition that

251
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,339
heavily influences systems and process

252
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,500
failures and we all kind of know how

253
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,380
this goes right so people leave

254
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,419
knowledge transfers hard or non-existent

255
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,458
doesn't happen a lot of times

256
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,839
institutional knowledge is lost also you

257
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,160
have to train up these new people that

258
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,080
takes time that takes money we can see

259
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,700
how all of this can help contribute to a

260
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,800
system or process failure

261
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,320
and in the poneumon study they really

262
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,240
Dove deep into what makes working in a

263
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,220
sock painful and if we look at some of

264
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,620
these statistics we can see that it's a

265
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,480
lot of what we talked about earlier with

266
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,279
alert fatigue and nuisance alarms things

267
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,800
of that nature seventy percent of people

268
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,300
who work in a sock out of fifteen

269
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,800
thousand said they have information

270
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,080
overload problems and this leads again

271
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,019
to pain in the sock 61 say they have too

272
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,700
many alerts to chase think back to alert

273
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,760
floods nuisance alarms and 61 say

274
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,320
working in a stock is painful because

275
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,940
again they have this latent condition of

276
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,980
turnover and they have the inability to

277
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,860
recruit and retain expert personnel

278
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,600
and this is why alert fatigue is

279
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,940
classified in multiple Industries as

280
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,019
something that's called a technical

281
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,180
Hazard and that's what we really want to

282
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,620
focus on today

283
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,060
so if there's one thing that you're

284
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,860
going to take from this if that

285
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,600
conversations around alert fatigue need

286
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,360
to be reframed in terms of safety we

287
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,860
need to be able to discuss that badly

288
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,300
designed alerts can turn into a

289
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,980
technical Hazard that can cause us to

290
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,420
have a process failure

291
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,339
alert fatigue has been classified as a

292
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,019
dangerous root cause of mistakes in

293
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,000
multiple Industries and in cyber

294
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,440
security we must acknowledge that it

295
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,779
jeopardizes our mission as well

296
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,459
it must be emphasized that an abundance

297
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,800
of alerts alerts that can't be triaged

298
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,420
in a timely fashion or alerts that are

299
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,580
not maintained they are dangerous for

300
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,959
your organization you are trying to

301
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,459
protect and they can jeopardize your

302
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:12,300
mission

303
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,100
so due to this we need to Design Systems

304
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,200
where analysts are set up to succeed and

305
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,300
aren't suffering from alert fatigue so

306
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,040
how do we do this we're going to look at

307
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,300
again different Industries where they've

308
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,980
been studying this since the 90s and

309
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,779
hopefully learn from them

310
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,060
all right so one of my favorite places

311
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,560
to learn about how to design better

312
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,120
alerts is industrial process control

313
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,380
systems

314
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,540
if you look at this up here this is a

315
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,399
wonderful infographic about how you

316
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,019
design ideal alerting and Industrial

317
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,880
process control systems we're going to

318
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,560
see it's really really similar to what

319
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,700
we're actually trying to achieve in

320
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,260
cyber security

321
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,140
so an industrial controls what they're

322
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,700
trying to do let me have a coffee before

323
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,300
we go into this

324
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,220
is design alerts that allow an analyst

325
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,779
to detect

326
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,600
diagnose and respond and Implement some

327
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,640
sort of containment measure here they

328
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,800
say react if you look before a hazardous

329
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,839
event occurs and this is obviously

330
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,279
extremely similar to our incident

331
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,959
response life cycle and what we're

332
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,480
trying to do so we're never going to be

333
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,800
able to catch everything early enough in

334
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,660
the kill chain where we can do this but

335
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,040
ideally what we're trying to do in cyber

336
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,740
security is design alerts that um

337
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,779
basically the analyst is able to again

338
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,839
detect diagnose respond put some sort of

339
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,399
containment measure in before a

340
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,800
hazardous event occurs and in industrial

341
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,660
Control Systems the Hazardous event is

342
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,399
an explosion or something of that nature

343
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,079
then cyber security we're trying to have

344
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,579
our analysts do all of this before our

345
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,860
hazardous event which is encryption

346
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,600
someone installing a back door someone

347
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,060
sending out a BEC payment before that

348
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,199
hazardous event occurs

349
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,399
and again we're just today talking about

350
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,019
how we can design a systems that allow

351
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,640
this to happen

352
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,740
the best way to learn from this is

353
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,820
something called the ISA alarm

354
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,100
management protocol which came out in

355
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,839
the 90s actually

356
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,519
um as the product of a bunch of

357
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,019
industrial disasters that had alert

358
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,720
fatigue at their core that killed people

359
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,980
um and one of the things that I want to

360
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,279
focus on here is specifically you see

361
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,060
underline in bold management so the

362
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,440
problem with cyber security and I've

363
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,060
seen this multiple places at multiple

364
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,640
sizes of organizations is they focus on

365
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,200
making alerts and putting them into prod

366
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,120
they don't actually focus on the

367
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,800
management of the alert which really is

368
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,980
the most important part so

369
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,660
yes that's great that you made an alert

370
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,800
but if you're not measuring how

371
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,420
successful it is you're not auditing it

372
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,100
you're not tuning it it's not really

373
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,140
worth very much at the end of the day

374
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,940
um and that's where we need to learn

375
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,980
from other Industries is this management

376
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,899
piece of our alerts and how to make them

377
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,000
more successful

378
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,380
so what we're going to talk about in the

379
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,880
next slide is a little bit about the

380
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,079
philosophy

381
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,839
but then the rest of the talk basically

382
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,300
focuses on the auditing so how are we

383
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,500
going to audit our alerts to make sure

384
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,420
they're good what kind of language do we

385
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,740
use and how are we actually going to

386
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,959
measure success

387
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,180
thank you

388
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,639
so again we want to focus on the actual

389
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,040
philosophy the philosophy is where you

390
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,420
lay out what you're actually going to

391
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,820
alert on so are you doing in-house alert

392
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,560
development are you mixing in Vendor

393
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,240
alerts are you just using vendor alerts

394
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,940
but also specifically how things are

395
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,680
going to be tuned how they're going to

396
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,300
be audited and how you're going to

397
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,160
define success you should have a

398
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,540
complete framework for this and again

399
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,040
not just focus on making the alerts

400
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,800
themselves or turning things on

401
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,360
there's really important pieces that

402
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,620
come out of this that sometimes people

403
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,200
Overlook that can definitely be

404
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,240
extremely dangerous so sometimes people

405
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,459
will figure out the tuning but then one

406
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:33,839
of the things a lot of people miss too

407
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,579
that if you don't do this in your

408
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,620
organization I'm you really should start

409
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,120
doing it right away is auditing

410
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,519
exclusion lists and that's like messy

411
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,260
work it's time consuming work but it can

412
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,339
save you

413
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,260
a big disaster down the line and again

414
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,639
you need to actually agree on all these

415
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,320
things beforehand and if you don't

416
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,940
actually start agreeing on them soon

417
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,579
I've seen really messy arguments about

418
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:54,959
who actually is going to own these

419
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,820
different processes and procedures so

420
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,779
it's something that you really should

421
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:58,860
look into

422
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,600
but one of the things that I wanted to

423
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,700
highlight is that even if you're not

424
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,260
like

425
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,600
gigantic and you can't make

426
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,279
implement this at your organization like

427
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,540
most of us let's be honest like people

428
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,740
are working with shoestring teams

429
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,120
sometimes of less than 10 people you've

430
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,800
got two or three people you're not going

431
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,940
to be able to implement this in your

432
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,220
organization but the important piece is

433
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,200
that you're constantly auditing in the

434
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,540
background and this constant cycle of

435
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,220
seeing if the alerts are successful if

436
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,959
they're useful or going on so we're

437
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,339
going to discuss how you actually want

438
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:27,600
to do that

439
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,220
the first thing you want to do is make

440
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,360
sure that the right people are in the

441
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,800
conversation

442
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,360
um when you're determining who is going

443
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,300
to tune how often and uh who is actually

444
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,040
going to be auditing you need to make

445
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,660
sure that the people who are working the

446
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,639
alerts on the front line are roped in

447
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,100
and this is where a lot of people make a

448
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,360
huge mistake

449
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,519
um so if you're in I work for an

450
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,680
extremely large retailer we have our own

451
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,660
content engineering team sometimes

452
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,339
there's a good feedback loop between the

453
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,199
content engineering team in mind

454
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,660
sometimes again I worked in an mssp sock

455
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,940
you'll have the clients who are making

456
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,560
alerts turning on alerts and they're not

457
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,820
engaging the people in the software

458
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,040
actually working them you have to engage

459
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,959
the right people in order for things to

460
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,880
be effective and this is something in

461
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,040
other industries that they really hit

462
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,680
the nail on the pit yeah hit the nail on

463
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,779
the head multiple times so alerts must

464
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,880
be configured valuable and usable for

465
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,740
the people using them they don't need to

466
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,480
be usable for the people who design them

467
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,160
they need to or the people in leadership

468
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,779
they need to be usable for the people

469
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,540
who work them and in Industrial Systems

470
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,160
they say that the alarm is a tool that's

471
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,260
used by the operator and must meet the

472
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,300
operator specifications to function

473
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,399
correctly again so it's the person who's

474
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,139
working those alerts day in Day Out

475
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,339
and in healthcare one of the ways that

476
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,220
they do this is clinician assessments

477
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,839
um in Vanderbilt for at Vanderbilt for

478
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,519
example they started they poll everyone

479
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,260
the clinicians the people who work the

480
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,320
alerts day in day out and then if the uh

481
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,120
results about another are unsatisfactory

482
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,860
it goes to a secondary committee for

483
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,260
tuning what they ask is they ask is it

484
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,180
effective this next piece is very

485
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,320
important it's one of my favorite parts

486
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,199
of this whole presentation actually did

487
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,600
it result in a meaningful action and

488
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,339
then is the operator satisfied with the

489
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,560
alert and this whole idea of meaningful

490
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
action is incredibly important and it's

491
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,000
a great way to measure actually

492
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,380
hmm

493
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,199
all right so

494
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,540
right now in cyber security on Twitter

495
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,579
there's a bunch of really gross debates

496
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,440
about true positive and false positive

497
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,579
and what's the definition of true

498
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,019
positive and false positive and blah

499
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,880
blah blah and this is an important

500
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,500
debate and it's become more important

501
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,880
because

502
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,100
anyone who works in stock or IR we know

503
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,600
it's best practice to have some sort of

504
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,820
threshold right so like if an alert has

505
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,279
an 85 or 90 false positive rate we

506
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,560
should tune it's this is becoming more

507
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,660
in Vogue in its best practice

508
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,579
what we want to do instead though it's

509
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:48,959
important to look at things as true

510
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,639
positive true positives and false

511
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,040
positives we actually want to look at if

512
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,779
an alert can result in a meaningful

513
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,160
action and that's what they do in

514
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,199
multiple different Industries

515
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,880
um so in industrial Control Systems they

516
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,920
actually call it a primary action which

517
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,480
involves someone explicitly doing

518
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,640
something that affects the process in

519
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,020
cyber security putting in some sort of

520
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,579
containment mechanism

521
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,000
they also advise people to get rid of

522
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,040
any kind of alerts that only result in a

523
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,619
secondary action in cyber security is to

524
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,640
be the same thing as an industrial

525
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,619
control system so an alert goes off and

526
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,599
all you have to do is call someone or

527
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,000
email someone or something like that get

528
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,439
rid of those just send them directly to

529
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,459
the person who should be getting them

530
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,720
anyways

531
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,460
um it's an easy way to reduce alert

532
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,140
volume and also just to speed up your

533
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,580
process in general

534
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,799
and I wanted to kind of focus on this in

535
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,299
general focus on this again because I

536
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,400
think it's very important is making sure

537
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
that we're getting rid of alerts that

538
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,240
only result in secondary actions and

539
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,400
we're focusing on primary actions so

540
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,720
again if you have an alert that only

541
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,059
tells you once it goes off

542
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,400
someone email someone

543
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,860
um talk to this person get get rid of

544
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,720
that the other thing too if you ever

545
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,580
have worked in a soccer IR

546
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,260
if someone tries to turn on an alert

547
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,299
that won't have a containment action and

548
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,500
they look at you and they're like you're

549
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,640
like well what do you want me to do with

550
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,100
this if it fires and they go well we

551
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,960
want you to look into it if they can't

552
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,640
tell you what the oh I'm sorry

553
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,160
sorry this child um if they can't tell

554
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,200
you what look into this actually means

555
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,760
it's not something you should be

556
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,919
alerting on we really want to be looking

557
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,419
again at alerts that have a primary

558
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,240
action so that result in do you have to

559
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,220
network contain a asset do you have to

560
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,780
network contain multiple assets

561
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,580
hopefully not do you have to remove

562
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,559
emails and then we can actually use that

563
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,120
as a measurement standard for what a

564
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,460
good alert is is does it actually result

565
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,919
in a primary action a large portion of

566
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,120
the time

567
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,919
and this is important because we really

568
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,840
really need to address volume and so we

569
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,100
need to look at what those high value

570
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,679
alerts are and make sure we get rid of

571
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,900
anything that's not a high excuse me a

572
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,340
high value alert

573
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,740
and one of the things too is that we

574
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,900
need to work with what's real not the

575
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,820
ideal and ask ourselves what we can

576
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,020
actually alert on with our current

577
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,840
Staffing levels people are a luxury and

578
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,039
likely you do not have the luxury of

579
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,299
letting your people investigate block

580
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,280
traffic or anything that doesn't invest

581
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,080
excuse me it doesn't end in a primary

582
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,360
action and you need to know that if you

583
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,100
actually do want to have a large amount

584
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,840
of alerts that have secondary actions or

585
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,820
things that no one does you're risking

586
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,559
giving your analyst alert fatigue and

587
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,760
they will leave and that will cost you

588
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,940
money

589
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,520
oh I'm doing really good on time so one

590
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,900
thing I just kind of like want to divert

591
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,240
onto really quick is um speaking of

592
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,860
volume and things like that so again and

593
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,059
having this kind of like realist

594
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,679
realistic conversation with your

595
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,440
analysts please before you turn things

596
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,539
on talk with your sock or your IR team

597
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,820
and ask if they have the bandwidth to

598
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,919
actually work them and oh do you have a

599
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,980
question are you just yes

600
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,960
yeah we're good we're good yeah

601
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,840
I think you want to again look at

602
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,400
I wouldn't identify who's the wrong

603
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,660
person I'd identify who's the right

604
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,160
person which again are the people who

605
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,220
work the alerts so and then it depends

606
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,720
on each organization again whether you

607
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,580
have a Content engineering team or

608
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,500
whether you're doing it yourself but it

609
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,080
needs to be a conversation between

610
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,580
management and the people who are

611
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,418
working the alerts

612
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,740
correct

613
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,940
that would be I think that could work

614
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,980
yes it depends on the org though yes

615
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,280
please

616
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,520
yes

617
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,580
yes and then also doing the analysis

618
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,960
um I'm a really big believer that the

619
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,460
alerts actually should provide context

620
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,620
to the analyst and you should be the

621
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,940
analyst should before you turn something

622
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,679
on you should actually show what the

623
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:53,940
alert is to the analyst and be like can

624
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,020
you work with this does this give you

625
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,580
enough information to actually do

626
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,980
something with and investigate in a

627
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,400
timely manner

628
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,419
but yeah talk with your people before

629
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,460
you turn them on come to them and be

630
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,200
like okay when we were testing this

631
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,400
fires

632
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,340
20 times a week do you actually have the

633
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,200
bandwidth to to work with something like

634
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,580
this they'll appreciate it it's just

635
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,380
better for you in general

636
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,160
another way to actually work with tuning

637
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,840
and also make your system safer is

638
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,880
prioritization uh one of my favorite

639
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,500
directors he always used to say if

640
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,360
everything is important nothing is

641
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,039
important and this is very true and you

642
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,260
have to prioritize analysts need to be

643
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,640
given very clear guidance on

644
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,039
prioritization and this helps not just

645
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,720
with tuning but also if someone's

646
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,700
receiving an alert flood that way they

647
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,799
can actually figure out what are the

648
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,299
things that I need to focus on and what

649
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,159
is a cascading event that maybe I can

650
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,500
leave at the Wayside for the moment

651
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,140
um in aviation they use for example

652
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,260
warning watch and advisory and you can

653
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,580
start you can kind of see where I'm

654
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,539
going with this from a tuning

655
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,039
perspective you can maybe start if you

656
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,240
have problems with volume which most

657
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,159
places do you can start tuning out the

658
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,500
advisory alerts things like that

659
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,120
um one of the big arguments I hear

660
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,100
against this is a lot of people are very

661
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,179
leery

662
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,280
to give low any kind of low

663
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,900
prioritization of stuff because what

664
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,520
they think is going to happen is the

665
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,539
analyst is going to look at it and

666
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,280
they're going to disregard it my

667
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,260
argument against that is that if you are

668
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,640
not actually giving your analysts

669
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,260
prioritization they're just going to

670
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,580
make up their own and it's not going to

671
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,140
address things how you want it to be you

672
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,460
don't want things to be ad hoc and

673
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,659
people just making up their own

674
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,440
prioritization model

675
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,720
So In Sum we're trying to reduce alert

676
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,000
volume which keeps our team safer which

677
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,440
keeps our people happier and hopefully

678
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,020
makes them stay longer and a few key

679
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,539
ways we want to do this I didn't have a

680
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:41,940
slide on this because it's so remedial I

681
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,740
didn't think it needed one but this

682
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,679
cannot be underestimated remove all

683
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,440
duplicate alerts it is very remedial

684
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,580
your people should not be getting

685
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,140
duplicate alerts but a lot of different

686
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,260
software Pro um different platforms send

687
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,240
them accidentally and this needs to be

688
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,280
engineered out also like a really kind

689
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,200
of low hanging fruit example

690
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,419
um is if you are alerting on like a fish

691
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,640
campaign don't alert on every single

692
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,440
email you know create an individual

693
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,419
alert find a way to kind of bundle them

694
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:10,380
together

695
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,240
but we also want to ensure alerts hold

696
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,760
value and are not overridden often again

697
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,320
that's by looking at what results in a

698
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,720
meaningful or primary action

699
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,760
um and also our our people are happy

700
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,159
with and we also want to reduce advisory

701
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,020
alerts or any alert that is considered

702
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,679
low priority

703
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,059
um the other thing too

704
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:31,620
I'm going to touch on this and don't

705
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,840
throw fruit at me if you also hate

706
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,400
risk-based alerting I just call it

707
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,559
alerting but one of the a really good

708
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,980
way to actually reduce volume and make

709
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,799
your analysts have a better picture is

710
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,240
risk-based alerting which again is a

711
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,500
buzzword but

712
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,820
um this is where we're designing alerts

713
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,760
that focus on abnormal situations

714
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,039
instead of just an abnormal variable we

715
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,240
want to group this activity together

716
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,400
better so users users can gain context

717
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,740
in a more effective Manner and it also

718
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,360
reduces volume right so like if you have

719
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,580
a host that has nine alerts on it you

720
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,840
don't want them to come in individually

721
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,640
ideally you'd like this to be grouped

722
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,900
into a case which you give to your

723
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,539
analysts and I do realize that there is

724
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,059
like a technical barrier to doing this

725
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,320
sometimes like some people don't have

726
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,600
the system for this but the idea is that

727
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,100
even if you can't implement this now

728
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,080
that you have it on the horizon and

729
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,980
you're moving towards it

730
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,700
this gentleman and I over a beer

731
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,900
yesterday had a very good conversation

732
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,539
about risk-based learning actually

733
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,580
um some kind of as we bring this home

734
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,159
and I have like a lot of I had a lot of

735
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,720
coffee today I have a lot of time for

736
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,520
questions and as my father said no one

737
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,900
ever got shot for going too short so

738
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,220
this is good

739
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,520
um but so with program management one of

740
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,900
the things I wanted to hit on as well is

741
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,539
metrics development so not just are we

742
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:46,980
measuring what we're turning on and

743
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,840
putting into prod but is something

744
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,360
meaningful and we can actually measure

745
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,039
whether or not our alerts have resulted

746
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,659
in a meaningful action more often than

747
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,720
not and then we can tune based on that

748
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,980
um and we also again want to create

749
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,780
thresholds for tuning whether even if

750
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,799
you're just going to use true positive

751
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,080
or false positive create thresholds for

752
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,020
tuning and adhere to that one of the

753
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,360
things I think is really important too

754
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,860
the less people you have the more

755
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,179
important it is that you're measuring

756
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,280
because if you only have four people and

757
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,780
you're doing like a round robin of who's

758
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,480
working the alerts you really don't have

759
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,700
time to waste and so you need to set up

760
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,260
this kind of metrics and measurement

761
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,940
that's going on in the background and

762
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,320
even if you just meet every couple of

763
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,700
months and say this is what's working

764
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,020
this is what's not this is what we're

765
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,700
going to turn off it's important this is

766
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,440
always going on in the background

767
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
and another thing that I've seen

768
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,880
programs do which is a problem is again

769
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,440
they're just measuring things that they

770
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,900
turn on and put into prod tuning takes

771
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,900
time tuning takes a lot of time measure

772
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,340
how much you're tuning how long it's

773
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,440
taking use that as a metric for success

774
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,659
for your team and also measure if you're

775
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,220
turning things off or other pieces of

776
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,140
alert management that reduce alert rot

777
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,760
alert rot is when you have old things

778
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,679
just kicking around that like I think

779
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,760
everyone's kind of seen this before

780
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,620
you're like this hasn't fired in six

781
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,960
years but it's still there and like

782
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,520
you're like I don't even know what I do

783
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,500
with this if we're fired if you have

784
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,940
things like that don't don't have them

785
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,200
on to be honest with you because you

786
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,059
really should be managing things and

787
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:10,679
unless you're you can't manage a whole

788
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:11,760
bunch of things that are inactive and

789
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,860
you don't know what they're doing this

790
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,539
is also really really important for out

791
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,760
of the box Fender alerts a lot of people

792
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,620
don't measure out of the box vendor

793
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,960
alerts and there's very we all know this

794
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,179
there's some junk crap out there like

795
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,919
you really need to be holding your

796
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,360
vendors accountable and measuring

797
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,919
whether their alerts are good or not

798
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,419
bringing it to your Tam bringing it to

799
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:31,919
your customer success manager her

800
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,600
holding them accountable and also

801
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,520
turning things off as well

802
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,279
as well one of the things too if anyone

803
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:41,580
has an internal like content creation

804
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,460
team a very powerful powerful metric as

805
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,100
we talked about earlier

806
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,039
perception of effectiveness of alerts if

807
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,039
you actually can say when I came in

808
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,919
there was very this you know this many

809
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,820
analysts thought the alerts were

810
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,120
ineffective I moved the needle and made

811
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,120
people perceive the alerts worth you

812
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,100
know more affected by 30 that's a

813
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,900
powerful powerful statistic it's a good

814
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,799
thing that you can be able to tell

815
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,100
people

816
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,059
and this is the next thing I want to

817
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,980
last thing I want to get into

818
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,659
um that I think is really important um

819
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,640
so in cyber security we all know are

820
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,779
familiar with the idea of root cause

821
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,659
analysis right basically the initial

822
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,700
infection Vector how the person got in

823
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,200
etc etc

824
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,460
um

825
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,200
and we've all kind of seen incidents

826
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,000
where what happens is someone somewhere

827
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,980
along the way missed an alert or didn't

828
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,600
analyze it properly or something of that

829
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,360
nature foreign

830
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,559
industrial Control Systems when they

831
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,559
have an incident or a giant a critical

832
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,179
incident and they do their root cause

833
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,400
analysis there's actually a very

834
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,020
explicit guidance that you should not

835
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,640
blame the analysts who missed the alert

836
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,919
or who made the improper action and

837
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:54,240
instead what you actually want to do is

838
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,860
look at your program as a whole and see

839
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,960
how it's designed and ask yourself if

840
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,340
you've made a program where people are

841
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,740
prone to making mistakes so again was it

842
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,380
because the alert volume was so high the

843
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,640
person actually couldn't figure out how

844
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,020
to prioritize or figure out what they

845
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,299
were doing have you actually created an

846
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:10,980
environment where people are literally

847
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,080
tired where you're making people work

848
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,820
12-hour shifts you know four days a week

849
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,159
and they are literally tired you need to

850
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,500
ask yourself again have I made this kind

851
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,820
of system where people can make mistakes

852
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,559
all the time and we're using the root

853
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,159
cause analysis to design a safer system

854
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,659
and again that's what we're trying to do

855
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:29,880
today and just take this with you again

856
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,320
you're never going to be able to change

857
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,700
the fact that people will occasionally

858
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,159
make mistakes but you actually can help

859
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,740
design a program and a process where

860
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,240
people make less mistakes and it makes

861
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,460
our organization safer overall

862
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,419
so

863
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,100
that being said my dad would be proud I

864
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,419
went very short

865
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,799
um does anyone have like questions

866
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,120
comments anything yeah please

867
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,419
yeah

868
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,000
and oftentimes we feel like your

869
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,740
conversation

870
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,840
yes

871
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,260
yes

872
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:26,279
it would depends who you're talking to

873
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,720
but if you're talking to management I

874
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,940
would talk about terms of waste and

875
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,860
particularly so also specifically if

876
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,240
you're dealing with managed service

877
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,559
providers most of those places actually

878
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,419
like are you're charging you have a cap

879
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:37,919
of alerts for the month and anything

880
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,080
over your charge and so that's where I

881
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,159
would start actually I'd be like you're

882
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,260
actually risking costing people money

883
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,580
when really you could just be sending

884
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,440
this directly to someone else and that

885
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,820
completely eliminates that risk that

886
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,380
we're going to have you're literally

887
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,140
going to be charged for that so

888
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,700
anyone else yeah

889
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,100
yes

890
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,880
I I like that and also too I

891
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,039
so when I was in threat Intel I did I

892
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,960
designed some alerts for our IR team and

893
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,399
I would work them myself before I gave

894
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,260
them to people and then I knew like I

895
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,059
was like listen this is coming out it's

896
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:32,460
going to be turned on if you have any

897
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,080
questions get get on the phone with me

898
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,520
and I'll literally work the alert with

899
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,320
you and some places it's just too big

900
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,640
where they can't do stuff like that but

901
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,720
I agree with you everything should have

902
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,220
an owner and everyone should be able to

903
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,960
I think actually this is a little more

904
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,760
radical I think everyone should be able

905
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,260
to work any sort of alert that they turn

906
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,820
on for someone else so

907
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,620
anyone else and then I'll let you go if

908
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,059
does anyone else have a question or

909
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,220
comment

910
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,700
oh

911
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,640
yeah you have you have to document

912
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,840
everything

913
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,539
so like I when I make alerts one of the

914
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:13,799
first things that I do is at the top I

915
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,360
always put objective

916
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,200
um so I'm like what is the other

917
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,760
actually trying to accomplish but then

918
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,840
yeah you have to manage the change

919
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,700
management process with how often things

920
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,340
are tuned and why they were tuned and

921
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,360
that's important too particularly

922
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,860
because as you add exclusions as well

923
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,720
those need to be audited particularly

924
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,760
over time so you have to document all of

925
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,740
your all the times it was tuned and what

926
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,140
the reason was so and then essentially

927
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,760
what I'm asking people to do and what

928
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,140
they do in other Industries is you go

929
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,580
through even if it's every six months

930
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,380
and say let's look at this let's look at

931
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,700
the exclusions that were added does it

932
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,440
still make sense does the alert still

933
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,059
make sense Etc

934
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:46,440
so

935
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,980
true

936
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,559
yes

937
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,100
do a search for

938
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,760
yes

939
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,520
I

940
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,360
can

941
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,820
really I think it really

942
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,360
follows

943
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,279
thank you well thank you guys for coming

944
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,080
here um the reason why I made this in

945
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,700
all honesty is I made it several years I

946
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,840
made part of it several years ago

947
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,460
because I was literally being drowned by

948
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,860
alerts and I had to actually make a case

949
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,779
to several people like you need to stop

950
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,279
doing this to me besides the fact that

951
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,260
it's costing me my sanity because some

952
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,520
people don't care about that to be

953
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,260
honest with you some people just they

954
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,299
some people have no empathy so I was

955
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,340
like maybe if I could put this in a

956
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,740
language that's more serious

957
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,380
um and to this day like basically

958
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,000
whenever there's noisy alerts that

959
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,440
people don't want to trot out I start

960
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,000
like speaking in this terms of like

961
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,679
danger and safety and like you're

962
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:30,840
actually gonna cause an instant by

963
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,279
Drowning Us in alerts like we can't work

964
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,080
this and it actually is effective and I

965
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,940
can tell you that from first from first

966
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,519
hand so but thank you for all for coming

967
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,980
I appreciate it and

968
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,299
um as we say in professional parlance

969
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:43,559
I'll give you some time back you can

970
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,419
have 25 minutes have have a coffee or

971
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,399
whatever so

972
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:50,178
yeah what's up

973
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,580
yeah every year yes so there's something

974
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,219
called Sentinel events which are

975
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,020
basically like when someone dies because

976
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,699
of whatever it didn't because of

977
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,080
something unrelated to what brought them

978
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,239
to the hospital and alert fatigue is the

979
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,619
number one cause of Sentinel events in

980
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:17,820
healthcare

981
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,399
um particularly with like uh prescribing

982
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,780
medicine and stuff like that because all

983
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,000
those systems were so noisy

984
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,099
um there was like 95 false positives

985
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,780
when they would try to do an alert a

986
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,739
clinician like literally you're

987
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,179
prescribing a dose that's going to kill

988
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,560
someone they were so used to clicking

989
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,239
through they just literally kept

990
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,320
clicking through and like you can Google

991
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,000
it like Google like fatigue Healthcare

992
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,159
medication and every year there's a

993
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,599
whole bunch of people who die from it so

994
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,980
it's um

995
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,780
we don't take it as seriously as we

996
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,580
should in cyber security because people

997
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,260
