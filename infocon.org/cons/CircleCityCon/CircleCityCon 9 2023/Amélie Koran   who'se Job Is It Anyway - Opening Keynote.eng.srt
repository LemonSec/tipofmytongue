1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,580
uh here we go it's the one fancy slide

2
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,900
that I have that it fades in it was from

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,340
a template so you bear with me on this

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,160
one so uh hi it's me I got the great

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,740
intro appreciate that so um you know so

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,300
one thing I would like to say thank you

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,219
for inviting me here uh it's not my

8
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,360
first time in Indianapolis first time

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,739
here at Circle city con so I really

10
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,300
appreciate you guys uh having faith in

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,500
me that I'm gonna present something

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,260
that's kind of interesting so

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:43,800
um

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,840
having been around a bit uh yeah which

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,399
means I'm kind of old and wizened and it

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,840
also means I've seen a lot of stuff and

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,180
have experienced a lot of things so this

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,680
talk is to kind of cover some of that in

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,079
perspective on how uh and where to meet

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,059
your peers your management and other

21
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,160
organizations and Community about what

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,239
you do do

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,820
what you can do and what you should be

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,739
doing in this career space

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,180
think of this as a guide on how to

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,680
bridge gaps between different roles

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
functions and opportunities in this

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,159
space and what you can do to make your

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,960
life a little bit better your job a

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,580
little easier and maybe have a little

31
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,159
bit of fun while you're at it

32
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,060
so a little history so we're we are as a

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,280
simple calendar recounting of it about

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,200
40 years into what's now commonly

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,759
referred to as cyber security

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,619
this isn't saying that like hacking

37
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,180
freaking building and defending secure

38
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,979
systems didn't exist before that time

39
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,200
but as a space that can be clearly

40
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,020
defined as such this is where we are

41
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,000
so as we wake up each morning some of us

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,140
jokingly refer to ourselves as

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,720
graybeards our joints crack grabbing the

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,460
occasional end State wonder why the heck

45
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,900
we're still punching the clock each day

46
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,700
and we look back and think about where

47
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,799
we came from and where we are now

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,740
sometimes we're way better off in those

49
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,540
early days and sometimes things are much

50
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,799
much worse

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,439
so first off this isn't a career talk

52
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,320
this isn't a pipeline talk nor is this A

53
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,079
diversity talk this is just a real talk

54
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,579
this is a talk on where we can

55
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,320
conceivably go next

56
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,300
given our four Decades of slogging Along

57
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,099
coming from folks ripping apart Hardware

58
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,500
in their bedrooms basements and garages

59
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,560
and to where people can claim a PhD in

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,060
an area of expertise that we may have

61
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,680
all just had funds for Laughs way back

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,819
when

63
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,739
so current events if you guys been

64
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,180
watching the news and obviously like

65
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,739
catching much and all sorts of other

66
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,239
stuff online I really appreciate seeing

67
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,340
everybody in Mudge We Trust t-shirts

68
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,840
um so as it stands I'm in a few minutes

69
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,640
to kick off of a conference that's now

70
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,800
can almost add a tens digit to how long

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,360
it's been going on

72
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,700
so Defcon about one-third of what we

73
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,200
affectionately refer to as hacker summer

74
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,440
camp turned 30 this year you guys made

75
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,120
that joke earlier about someone you know

76
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,500
being old

77
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,239
um but we still encounter new things

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,280
every day but much of it is based on

79
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,260
mistakes or issues introduced into

80
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,360
languages hardware and operating systems

81
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,580
years ago that adversaries are still

82
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,980
discovering and working against us on

83
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,019
it provides some of us a really good

84
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,239
paycheck and for a couple new folks here

85
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,160
it's a suitable answer to your family

86
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,660
members when you get asked around the

87
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,400
dinner table what do you want to be when

88
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,660
you grow up

89
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,700
personally I started out as most of

90
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,440
people my age think of wanting to be a

91
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,440
vet an astronaut or like in my case I

92
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,940
want to get into visual effects for film

93
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,980
but well before I fell into my current

94
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,720
career space and glommed on it the same

95
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,459
way a remora would glom onto a shark for

96
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:24,900
cast off

97
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm not one of the rock stars ninjas

98
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,159
Pirates or have a blue check mark on the

99
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,140
bird platform or make a living on the

100
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,019
speaking circuit I'm just here I'm a

101
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,720
working stiff just like many of you here

102
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,280
I have some news for you from you know

103
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,860
two out of those 40 years to impart for

104
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,200
the next four or even just two decades

105
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,019
coming up

106
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:48,299
so I currently work

107
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,879
for two organizations uh one is my

108
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,440
primary source of income

109
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,599
um T-shirt here uh one is a large

110
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,040
entertainment company that's reflected

111
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,319
in my clothing uh and I'm kind of

112
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,879
prohibited on speaking on behalf of but

113
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,739
the other one is a side gig that I do

114
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,099
for a DC research thing Think Tank on

115
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,659
security policy and that's actually

116
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,980
where my interest lies so it's kind of

117
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,819
cool

118
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,700
my full-time job says because of the

119
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,280
business that they're in they can't I

120
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,840
can't ask for a three five or ten year

121
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,298
plan because the technology changes so

122
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,199
often

123
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,199
now the side gig that two percent asked

124
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,880
me to think about what's like hot now

125
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,620
and developed strategies that can put

126
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,360
those three five and ten year plans into

127
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,380
something that could be managed and

128
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,340
trusted

129
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,460
this makes my head hurt every day having

130
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,460
a context switch several times

131
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,740
I look back to when I was a little bit

132
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,259
more operational oh yeah go ahead shoot

133
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,120
away

134
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,500
um I look back to when I was a little

135
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,180
bit more operational finding evil in a

136
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,680
tech environment

137
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,780
um but where you know where things are

138
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,639
kind of coming across uh you know your

139
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,800
threats threat feeds and in social media

140
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,660
today and realize it's just a little bit

141
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,160
more sophisticated than what it was back

142
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,040
in the 2000s early 2000s and we're still

143
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
seeing the same threat actors doing the

144
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,720
same stuff we have new tools as so do

145
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,759
they and not so much of it this is a

146
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,860
cold war kind of an Artemis but it's

147
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,000
more of an escalation of the

148
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,320
brinkmanship

149
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,479
I look hard into the abyss of the future

150
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,699
and know anything that I say today

151
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,680
probably by the time I step off this

152
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,900
stage to some extent will be invalidated

153
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,919
and that's what we deal with

154
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,139
collectively on a day-to-day

155
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,479
so first off one of I think the problems

156
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,979
I'll get real on I'm sorry about the

157
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,780
small text here is over

158
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,820
professionalization I know that's a huge

159
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,120
big ass word but let's get in the the

160
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,699
Crux of this so so many of you who call

161
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,340
this space a career have a title that

162
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,080
based on Research that from other talks

163
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,060
I've done over the years didn't actually

164
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,120
exist before 2010 honestly you've got

165
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,979
you know whatever inflated title that

166
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,419
may be here and they put it there so

167
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,280
they can give you a paycheck and say

168
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,139
they you know you're doing something

169
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,479
for those who aren't my age this is

170
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,400
either also backed by like a certificate

171
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,979
a certification a degree or some other

172
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,900
track you followed adjunct to any like

173
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,400
personal interest you've had in the

174
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,900
space before you actually drew a

175
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,940
paycheck on it that's cool that's okay

176
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,880
that's how I got in this however it is a

177
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,500
current barrier to entry to this job

178
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,660
market for many opportunities they say

179
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,580
please have this cert this degree be

180
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,680
this tall to get on the ride have a

181
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,300
decade experience in a tech language

182
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,820
that's barely half a decade old shit's

183
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,520
broken I say but we keep feeding it

184
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,500
differences between expectations and

185
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,900
reality and also the desire driven by

186
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,819
regulations laws and the general sense

187
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,740
from private companies the public sector

188
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,120
has a little bit different issues of

189
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,639
please don't sue us and then ask the

190
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,280
world for help and just get about 30 of

191
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,720
what they actually want it in the way of

192
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,240
resources and talent

193
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,520
me I sure as hell didn't think this was

194
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,560
going to be my space while I have a

195
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,780
degree there's no way related to my

196
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,639
current job I will ignore any of the

197
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,680
titles I've had when I've been remotely

198
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,860
associated with security so my terms are

199
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,139
don't put Faith in paper put Faith In

200
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,340
Yourself

201
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,580
however for those who are hiring stop

202
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,620
asking for freaking unicorns they don't

203
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,539
exist in quantity or costs that you can

204
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,120
afford so re-jigger your asks and think

205
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,000
deeply better about your actual needs

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,919
even the US government doesn't have it

207
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,660
right

208
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,580
in my two lovely database talks on

209
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,440
hiring in this space both of them are at

210
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,380
schmukh Khan and devsecops the data

211
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,080
which drives this demand is so so out of

212
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,880
sync labor department is so out of sync

213
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,979
that in reality that feeds an entire

214
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,840
news cycle you've seen the Articles this

215
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,580
summer about the the walls are coming

216
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,500
down we don't have enough cyber bodies

217
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,300
and stuff like that when it actually

218
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,319
isn't

219
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,220
really hire smart people higher curious

220
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,860
people higher creative people

221
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,660
most of those have talents you can teach

222
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,860
the rest to

223
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,199
there's no ISC or EC Council cert that's

224
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,120
going to foretell when you get popped by

225
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,979
a nation state which is the in Vogue

226
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,020
adversary now or how those staff

227
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,819
actually perform Under Pressure given

228
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,380
that particular situation

229
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,180
I've been there I've done that it's all

230
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,620
down to how people work with one another

231
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,539
and see if you can look at the situation

232
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,160
and realize how screwed you actually are

233
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,680
and then work towards fixing it

234
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,039
so next one gatekeeping that's not a

235
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,900
this is not a career talk so I mentioned

236
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,580
graveyards earlier and that's a little

237
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,900
bit more affectionate term for folks

238
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,460
who've been around seeing some stuff

239
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,979
I've seen some stuff and tend to better

240
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,440
Regale Us in stories of your in your

241
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,539
face that were at a different level now

242
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,919
and they're just being technically

243
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,720
proficient at fixing stuff it just won't

244
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,060
make the grade nowadays

245
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,279
we actually have to properly interact

246
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,020
with other humans to be a little bit

247
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,419
more effective at our chosen vocation we

248
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,479
as humans have a self-protection switch

249
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,039
namely if we feel threatened we find

250
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,440
ways barring traditional weapons to fend

251
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,940
off impending doom

252
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,220
so as I noted for those who've been

253
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,260
around we may be in self-protection mode

254
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,660
or about keeping control knowledge

255
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,459
experience and just general act like

256
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,140
a-holes when it comes to welcoming and

257
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,700
supporting new people in the field

258
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,300
seriously stop that too I can count in

259
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,860
large volumes of how much I'd appreciate

260
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,360
another person to help with all the work

261
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,820
I've done and have to do

262
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,860
your fear about transferring knowledge

263
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,680
and Trust to somebody else is misplaced

264
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,720
next off the popular one here management

265
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,399
versus engineering

266
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,560
most organizations as it seems maybe

267
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,360
your own is a little bit different they

268
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,339
often identify as person X as being

269
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,560
fantastic at what they do and they think

270
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,300
about how to transfer that and manage

271
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,880
that knowledge so they promote them yeah

272
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,640
in most cases that doesn't actually work

273
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,860
management of people projects and so

274
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,959
forth and is another skill entirely

275
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,339
different from doing the tech thing that

276
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,260
you're most likely known for being

277
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,240
forced to basically lead people or lead

278
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,279
projects and programs may push folks

279
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,420
well beyond their personal Comfort

280
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,940
levels and even career desires

281
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,160
much like in academics because you're a

282
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,560
talented researcher doesn't make you an

283
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,420
actually excellent teacher if you have

284
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,220
the talent for people and resources and

285
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,260
management communication skills and by

286
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,839
far that is rare but it's also desired

287
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,220
so it's up to you to determine how you

288
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,420
want to use that

289
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,580
for managers listen to your people

290
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,440
listen what they have to say if you take

291
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,060
the route of placing your staff in roles

292
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,580
or duties that they have no desire to be

293
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,160
in then you may not you may be the only

294
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,600
person at fault if they decide to leave

295
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,220
but if they stay it may actually

296
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,959
adversely affect your operations and the

297
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,399
goals of your organization

298
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,100
however this is me coming from a former

299
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,140
hiring manager provide opportunities and

300
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,120
growth avenues for people to explore

301
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,220
strictly being dogmatic about keeping

302
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,899
technical people Technical and

303
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,880
management people management removes the

304
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,100
ability to build trust empathy and build

305
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,959
Communications and work experiences for

306
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,580
your staff

307
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,360
so everything does change there is at no

308
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,640
time in your career where you or your

309
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,560
peers have mastered all that there is to

310
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,779
be in this career space stop comparing

311
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,160
yourself to others I've had people tell

312
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,019
me that on Facebook when I complain if

313
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,700
they're super deep in a topic or they're

314
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,240
super broad you just do you one constant

315
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,860
here is that everything changes and

316
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,380
involves and so can you but don't let it

317
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,200
get overwhelming finding your Niche or a

318
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,820
sense of enjoyment is part of the career

319
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,980
in life development it may be immediate

320
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,839
or it may take some time

321
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,240
heck I'm 25 plus years into this and I'm

322
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,500
still dancing around with what gets me

323
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,579
out of bed in the morning beside an

324
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:12,540
alarm

325
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,519
the other thing about change is you're a

326
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,200
little lost now but until something

327
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,940
comes along that hits you where it's the

328
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,500
right thing you want to be doing it

329
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,760
could be something that doesn't exist

330
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,200
now or it could be something that you're

331
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,640
smashing two things together and

332
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,440
eventually you come and make this vision

333
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,880
of awesome that you want to go and do

334
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,160
for the rest of your life heck

335
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,959
I've been doing cyber threat analysis

336
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,820
well before they have that fancy title

337
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,800
it was interesting and fun but it was

338
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,899
long ago this is for the dod and that's

339
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,279
you know have their own terms for it I

340
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,720
forgot what it was but I don't think I'd

341
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,279
actually want to return

342
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,100
however having that informs me like

343
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,560
tools in a toolbox that this capability

344
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,140
is having somebody now specialize in it

345
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,880
and it's just part of their day job and

346
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,800
it's an activity all into their own so

347
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,000
you don't have to be the master of

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,100
everything you still need to fill your

349
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,260
toolbox but it's okay to loan those

350
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,360
tools out even get rid of some tools if

351
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,860
you're not using them on a regular basis

352
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,380
and just suits that you don't it just

353
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,700
doesn't suit what you want to need or do

354
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,519
if you learned it before you can learn

355
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,320
it again it's just not going still it's

356
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,459
just the focus and relevance

357
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,360
so

358
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,040
this part I really want to kind of drive

359
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,100
home a bit it's your sphere of influence

360
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,660
um yeah I'm going to go off a little

361
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,060
script here for a moment

362
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,980
um because this is more relevant to this

363
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,420
week's activities

364
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,000
a lot of times when you are in an

365
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,700
organization where you feel alone or you

366
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,620
may have another friend or a peer that

367
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,120
you're dealing with and you're wondering

368
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,920
why you're not gaining traction

369
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,959
and sometimes that's frustrating it

370
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,540
leaves you upset and and tired and not

371
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,980
wanting to do your work

372
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,600
the key thing is understand where your

373
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,339
sphere of influences are where you go

374
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,380
and touch those people that can actually

375
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,700
kind of help you along and get you out

376
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,959
of that hole

377
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,380
so I often get asked what can I do with

378
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,480
X to get y it all comes down to knowing

379
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,920
where that sphere of influence actually

380
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,560
covers and where you need to work to get

381
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,720
it to have others get it connected where

382
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,399
you want it to go and where you want it

383
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,380
to be it can shrink sometimes it can

384
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,320
span other times often that sphere of

385
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,880
influence shrinks when you change roles

386
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,980
or employers so if you leave this

387
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,139
massive sphere of influence you may have

388
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,399
had at a current employer shrinks down

389
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,139
you got to start all over again again

390
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,180
that's okay it's it's just the natural

391
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,920
form of moving around

392
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,800
figure out what you can change both of

393
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,839
the near near term and strategically in

394
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,120
the far term this is chess this isn't a

395
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,100
speed run I'm unfortunately not tying it

396
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,100
to uh the the cartoons but I'm more of a

397
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,360
video games person so we'll see where

398
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,399
that goes

399
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,040
those aren't you require some nuance and

400
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,540
manipulation this is a little bit of

401
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,700
that social engineering aspect uh you

402
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,019
know social engineer your boss a little

403
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:46,740
bit

404
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,660
don't do anything like gaslighting or

405
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,339
anything malicious but understanding

406
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,019
that each person in the role needs to be

407
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,579
handled very uniquely

408
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,800
a lot of frustration arises when you

409
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,480
start on something like a new gig a

410
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,579
project or another activity and feel

411
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,860
that nobody's listening paying attention

412
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,380
or seeing the value in your work the

413
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,000
sphere is part of where those edges can

414
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,160
kind of touch and influence so sometimes

415
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,260
aiming too wide in your blast radius and

416
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,480
thinking you have this Megaton idea when

417
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,980
it's actually just like a few kilotons

418
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,959
and those you wish were actually paying

419
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,459
attention or totally looking elsewhere

420
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,380
so it's like a lot of little explosions

421
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,560
however a number of small blasts small

422
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,600
kiloton blast can get you the attention

423
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,279
you so rightly need so if you have a

424
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,500
whole row of these little little small

425
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,660
kiloton blasts it'll add up to you know

426
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,480
clearing out what a Megaton would

427
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,000
your sphere of influence can increase as

428
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,680
you move up the proverbial ranks but

429
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,300
again if you don't feel like you want to

430
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,680
climb that ladder you know there's no

431
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,300
reason to go do so but it isn't always

432
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,699
actually guaranteed as you can have an

433
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,620
enormous amount of influence but also be

434
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,120
isolated because having to pull all

435
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,320
those switches for management and

436
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,480
managing people and projects uh becomes

437
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,860
distant from the main action so you're

438
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,480
not down in getting that visceral feel

439
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,699
so carefully figure out where you feel

440
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,260
comfortable and where your skills and

441
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,000
influence find that balance of where

442
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,040
you're comfortable with it

443
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,260
there's also a way to kind of chain

444
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,120
those spheres of influences like a

445
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,160
perverse Venn diagram where your work

446
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,600
and messages are kind of carried up the

447
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,220
chain across the organ Network structure

448
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,380
so if you can find that that's also the

449
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,240
next kind of Step there

450
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,000
so next up is getting this gang or band

451
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,500
back together like why security

452
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,000
conferences you all are sitting out here

453
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,279
in the middle of Indiana I'm from DC so

454
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,079
you know 500 miles to get here and

455
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,699
trying to figure out how Indiana works

456
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:28,320
you find yourself here at this

457
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,060
conference some of you attendees some

458
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,980
staff some speakers so thank you all who

459
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,959
are here and to be honest in our field

460
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,820
it's one of the best ways to expand our

461
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,380
sphere of influence you're here you're

462
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,120
meeting people and so forth you're

463
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,100
acting locally in this case and

464
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,180
hopefully spreading the knowledge

465
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,339
globally and especially since our career

466
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,199
space is rapidly adapted to sharing

467
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,240
Talks by YouTube and other means that's

468
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,560
another way where it kind of carries

469
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,839
beyond that this often comes because we

470
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,399
need to disseminate our timely research

471
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,680
quickly to the world and others but also

472
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,600
the need to just be open and transparent

473
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,519
about the cool stuff we found or build

474
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,779
or we know

475
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:03,300
well evidently we see the social aspect

476
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,220
of get-togethers like this where you

477
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,079
know hacker summer camp you go out there

478
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,839
you get to see friends it's family

479
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,120
um but also smaller ones like this it's

480
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,380
your local community you're getting

481
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,459
people you're building that Network

482
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:15,540
You're Building those spheres of

483
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,339
influences

484
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:18,959
it's that way for folks from different

485
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,579
organizations and situations to get

486
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,079
together come and learn exchange

487
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,300
experience complain at times but also

488
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,980
check on their work to see how they're

489
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,300
doing if they're doing the right thing

490
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,800
or what they could be doing to make

491
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,940
their lives a little bit better a little

492
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,139
bit easier

493
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,019
it's often harder to show value to

494
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,399
management

495
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,600
um you know especially if your

496
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,579
attendance is sponsored like why are you

497
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:39,839
going to the security conference why are

498
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,800
you spending your weekend doing this

499
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,839
well sometimes it's fun but other times

500
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,639
you're here to learn so one of the

501
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,259
things is trying to demonstrate that

502
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,480
value back to management it's difficult

503
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,699
especially if they don't show up

504
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,500
I've always been dismayed for the

505
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,420
longest time has not seen senior leaders

506
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,519
in our career space actually never make

507
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,680
it to smaller cons like this even the

508
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,240
larger ones are really sparsely attended

509
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,820
over time seems shmukon Defcon you

510
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,319
occasionally see some people in suits

511
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,339
show up

512
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,500
however in my current role it has me

513
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,419
addressing more kind of larger technical

514
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,760
Partners outside of just security and

515
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,919
typically their vendor conferences AWS

516
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,619
Google Microsoft and so forth and they

517
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,660
push towards having these guided

518
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,579
executive experiences these VIP

519
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,319
experiences

520
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,179
um and they shelter them away they kind

521
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,220
of move them off into an enclave or

522
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,020
behind a door and they give them the

523
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,120
better food and the better drinks and

524
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,660
the better swag and generally those just

525
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,880
focus on General Tech you know it kind

526
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,620
of seems very you know top level and

527
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,240
they just get a Surface experience to

528
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,039
this and then it just leaves us trying

529
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,419
to gather all the details we're in the

530
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:43,679
technical sessions trying to write

531
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,059
everything down come back with notes and

532
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,440
trying to bring that to them

533
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,600
well that kind of seems insurmountable

534
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,340
it's an opportunity to kind of bridge

535
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,020
those gaps between you and management

536
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,480
it's a conversation starter did you go

537
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,940
to this this session or did they tell

538
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,559
you about this thing so there's a little

539
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,299
bit of this kind of gossamer threats

540
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,220
that you have especially if you you know

541
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,720
do have management yourself attend the

542
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,640
same conference but the key thing is to

543
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,080
try to keep that momentum up and going

544
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,520
trying to make sure that when you get

545
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,720
back you have that conversation

546
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,400
immediately with them

547
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,960
so

548
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,700
you don't need to be a security person

549
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,320
to help in this area

550
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,000
now I was going to note under this last

551
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,039
Point while doing my own time to try to

552
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,840
do some Outreach and whatnot as that

553
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,299
wasn't a security conference

554
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:24,900
um

555
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,179
it was a little tough um it almost cost

556
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,039
me my job and I wish I could find the

557
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,780
pictures and stuff I did to kind of do

558
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,299
the research for this but um I actually

559
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:34,980
made that effort to bust the executive

560
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,419
out of that little bubble that they were

561
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,620
in

562
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,840
um yeah it did work I I required some

563
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,760
time with Photoshop and a trip to Kinkos

564
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,919
the next day and some scissors and glue

565
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,020
and and stuff like that but I you know

566
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,460
went and

567
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,840
you know kind of follow the rules a

568
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,039
little bit kind of broke the rules and

569
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,020
busted them out of the the uh the

570
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,039
executive session

571
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,840
and what it was is just you know you

572
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,160
needed to give them that visual feel

573
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,840
like get this was a Gartner conference

574
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,860
is the reason I don't get to go to

575
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,320
Gartner anymore

576
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,460
I I forged the badge just be out

577
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,840
um so I forged a badge to be able to get

578
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,460
and talk to the executives and and told

579
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,720
him I said you really need to go to

580
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,160
these other sessions don't just sit in

581
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,840
there and have the nice little uh you

582
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,980
know little cucumber sandwiches and

583
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,880
whatnot and you need to come here and

584
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,020
get the really crappy brownies that

585
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,400
they're serving

586
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,740
um but this isn't really talking about

587
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,120
breaking about the rules it's just

588
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,620
getting more serious about your work

589
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,720
getting getting what makes you excited

590
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,039
about your day-to-day job and getting

591
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,440
that instilled in the executives

592
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,960
this also is an opportunity to kind of

593
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,059
get Outreach outside your own Tech

594
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,220
circles uh perhaps somewhere elsewhere

595
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,860
in your business line uh you know Budget

596
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,380
Finance HR some other place where you

597
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,640
can kind of show tangible benefits

598
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,080
without actually trying to slog through

599
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,900
the Orthodoxy or the org chart

600
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,640
um in this case you're actually hacking

601
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,980
the organization uh you're trying to

602
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,020
demonstrate your value outside your

603
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,460
typical organization structure if you're

604
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,740
in like I.T or in security you're

605
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,419
usually pretty well silent this is an

606
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,160
opportunity for you to kind of like step

607
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,340
out over here like oh hey HR or oh oh

608
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,140
hey here manufacturing or something like

609
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,240
that where you maybe be uh you have in

610
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,740
your organization

611
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,720
some folks I will tell you will get

612
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,700
pissy if you go outside that chain of

613
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,500
command but you need to find those areas

614
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,240
and opportunities where others can help

615
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,860
you carry some of that water and spread

616
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,780
the good words on your behalf for about

617
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,179
your work essentially it's creating your

618
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:25,620
own marketing

619
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,020
so this is the one I will rail on paper

620
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,600
schmaper can you do a thing so screw

621
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,539
certifications yeah man screw them like

622
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,039
really scream I hate them I don't have

623
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,440
any which is why I hate them so much

624
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
um

625
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,919
I do have a degree but it's absolutely

626
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,679
useless in my current role but um I

627
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,960
think maybe early on it helped um and in

628
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,400
those times it was really you know I

629
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,720
wasn't doing anything actually related

630
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,880
to my degree either but you know it was

631
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,039
it was you know a foot in the door but

632
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,080
it also comes from both sides

633
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,220
um you know organizations are putting

634
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,720
too much emphasis on Outsourcing trust

635
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,780
like hey you've got an EC uh EC Council

636
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,940
certificate oh your hacker well no you

637
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,380
took a test you did the labs and stuff

638
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,720
like that like I want to put you in and

639
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,480
have you do the thing and and help solve

640
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,440
a problem something a little bit more

641
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,299
tangible more applied

642
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,880
um and it actually it helps ignore that

643
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,500
experience that knowledge exists like

644
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,360
one before we had this whole run on

645
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,760
certs I'd ask people about like hey what

646
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,260
do you do a home lab what do you do in

647
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,480
the free time do you do you uh word

648
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,700
Drive do you do Hardware hacking any of

649
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,900
these things that shows a level of

650
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,460
curiosity

651
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,840
um you know even as a hiring manager

652
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,460
I've been struck by some of these stupid

653
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,440
interviewing rules for me and my panel

654
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,240
that prevent me from actually asking

655
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,700
about that skill and that's where hires

656
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,159
have horribly gone sideways we hired a

657
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,440
sizzo see so whatever you want to

658
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,539
pronounce it as

659
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:49,380
who came from DHS when I was at HHS and

660
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,480
um like I wanted to drill him like did

661
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,760
you did you do you understand how to set

662
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,679
up like an IDs like even use an old

663
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,600
older individual and it's like did you

664
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,100
have this visual feel of like getting

665
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,960
frustrated with rules or hips when it

666
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,419
blocked everything and I couldn't ask

667
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:04,980
any of those questions it was like all

668
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,000
these little softball management

669
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,039
questions and like man you know I want

670
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,480
to know if you've had this pain that

671
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,039
I've had

672
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:11,700
um

673
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,520
so unfortunately there's no way to do

674
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,559
this without having them take surprise a

675
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,659
certification exam so you're kind of

676
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,460
damned if you do and damned if you don't

677
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,919
but what this does is it kind of uh

678
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,360
nothing does nothing but actually

679
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,159
standardized answers and removes all

680
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,900
that creativity I'm sure a lot of you

681
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,179
run into stuff where you've had to like

682
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,860
kind of throw the book out and come up

683
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,659
with something new that's the kind of

684
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:35,460
stuff that I think that really needs to

685
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,320
be fostered here in our community at

686
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,600
these conferences and at your jobs is

687
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,620
like

688
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,020
you could pull someone from somewhere

689
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,640
outside of security and give them this

690
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,020
problem and they'll look at it a little

691
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,940
bit differently

692
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,980
so it does actually kind of play against

693
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,720
the demands of organizations wanting

694
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,740
these unicorns because you're not

695
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,299
looking inside

696
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:55,919
um and a lot of these times we get these

697
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,780
postings like you know as I mentioned

698
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,460
before you know I want 10 years

699
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,659
experience in a language that's been

700
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,760
around for five years and we love to

701
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,919
roast those things on social media but

702
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,480
we also have to do our jobs about

703
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,039
telling managers and other folks

704
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,140
basically just stop doing this it's

705
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,600
absolutely useless like honestly risk

706
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,860
risk your neck because you're going to

707
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,320
eventually have to work with that person

708
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
so this is where some of that fixing

709
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,919
kind of comes into play and possibly if

710
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,360
you have some extra spoons to basically

711
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,740
go and do it and are involved in that

712
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,659
role or can influence a role in process

713
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,520
and hiring and help change some of that

714
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,559
process I believe actually one of the

715
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,900
folks here she is not in the room right

716
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,340
now but she was sitting right over here

717
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,919
wrote a book on this topic I highly

718
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,980
recommend it Alyssa read it awesome more

719
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,360
in depth

720
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,280
give her some props on that one

721
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,960
so we'll often hear organizations that

722
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,059
use this as a bare minimum you know you

723
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,980
got to be you know just another level

724
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,200
gatekeeping partake in non-traditional

725
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,179
learning you're screwed if you're not if

726
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,520
you're non-neurotypical you're screwed a

727
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,080
whole other folks who just go through

728
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,120
here and card collect all these things

729
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,799
that they need for these job

730
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,179
requirements but not get a full

731
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:01,980
understanding of it and it's a surreal

732
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,679
shame when I do resume review I usually

733
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,260
recommend on Focus to to focus people to

734
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,539
focus on talking about Concepts that

735
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,039
they understand and where they can

736
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,960
improve on things rather than just loads

737
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,059
asserts and and you know stuff that

738
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:18,120
they've installed Express where your

739
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,440
interests lie especially if you're new

740
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,880
if you're someone fresh out of college

741
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,100
or out of a degree program I've had so

742
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,419
many people kind of come up to me and

743
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,220
say where do I start information

744
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,020
security and cyber security is just such

745
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,419
this huge huge huge thing I was like

746
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,220
well do you like chasing down bad guys

747
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,140
okay cool blue team forensics incident

748
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,600
response do you like just the minutia of

749
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,799
just basically grinding away at

750
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,240
something okay cool you know malware

751
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,919
analysis and exploits and stuff like

752
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:42,480
that there's always something if you

753
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,220
have those types of focuses much like

754
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,240
you know trying to get someone

755
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,100
interested in what wine they like or if

756
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,419
they like a certain type of cheese or

757
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:49,799
something like that those are the kind

758
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,059
of questions you kind of need to ask to

759
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,159
help Focus people there

760
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,039
there's always another side to this and

761
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,900
it's the hiring side and I that's a

762
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,100
whole other talk

763
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,840
um but that's another side that totally

764
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,299
needs changing and help with so if

765
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:04,860
there's a follow-on talk to this I would

766
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,059
love to have someone come up and say hey

767
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,039
yeah I've I've cracked the egg I know

768
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,799
how to get HR to do the perfect hiring

769
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,440
uh we have the most amazing team we're

770
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,059
killing it we're going to move on to

771
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:16,200
another organization because they're

772
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,539
entirely secure

773
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,580
so

774
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,179
let's move over here no oh no my remote

775
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,520
got de-paired oh it wants to do a

776
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,299
software update

777
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,159
defer Hells yeah I'm going to defer I'm

778
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,020
in the middle of a talk

779
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,700
there we go

780
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,620
thank you EA

781
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,700
um anyhow

782
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,299
um

783
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,880
so so hacking people it's not what you

784
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,940
think but it kind of sort is so for me

785
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,679
I've been termed sometimes as a

786
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,120
disgruntled employee not an Insider

787
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,260
threat but someone who's been upset at

788
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,700
the organization

789
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,220
so let's be honest we've all been at

790
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,659
this stuff for a while you've been at a

791
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,580
role organization or another situation

792
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,200
that's been deemed a little bit less

793
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,940
than ideal or good or even healthy you

794
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,140
know people's hair are falling out

795
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,520
you're sweating you got zits and all

796
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,600
sorts of stuff

797
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,820
it's a paycheck to keep you from going

798
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,620
home and just playing video games all

799
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,200
day let's just freely admit that okay

800
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,860
um

801
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,659
so the key thing to keep you moving

802
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,640
forward and hopefully up and out of that

803
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,700
situation is being a useful disgruntled

804
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,779
employee

805
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,700
so why would I kind of say that because

806
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,539
it kind of seems a little bit

807
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,000
counter-intuitive but let's take a

808
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,100
moment and examine how you got where you

809
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,400
are when you're that point

810
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,260
um you know where did things go wrong

811
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,480
can you do some self-examination as is

812
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,980
this an organization thing is it just

813
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,080
not a fit for me do I hate my co-workers

814
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,299
is the coffee bad

815
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,159
um but you know sometimes you can adjust

816
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:42,720
a few things and it'll actually make you

817
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,120
want to stick around uh you know maybe

818
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,100
opening up the blinds in your office if

819
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,740
you have a window or you know walk

820
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,539
around after every 10 minutes when you

821
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:52,919
get frustrated with an email from your

822
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:55,140
boss that's some growth

823
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,940
other times you may actually just need

824
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,159
to document like what's off and if you

825
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,480
know you can't hang around to be there

826
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,039
and help find somebody you can carry

827
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,659
that message for it and while you're

828
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,820
there and have moved on that person gets

829
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,840
to kind of carry that water but

830
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,039
eventually they'll have a stack of paper

831
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,360
this High telling you what you need to

832
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,320
fix

833
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,760
if you don't it's just going to get

834
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,100
worse for everybody else there I've seen

835
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,840
it I've actually had one experience

836
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,220
where I told that they needed to fire

837
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,620
this person and three weeks later they

838
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,179
were finally fired and everybody at the

839
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,100
organization was like huzzah and I'm

840
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,539
like yes

841
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,760
it took a while but it happens

842
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,460
so again in short it may really be them

843
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,980
and not you and they may be open for

844
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,539
change or suggestion

845
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,520
the case where that worked especially if

846
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,900
they're moving forward without actually

847
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,460
spending some time re-examining things

848
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,659
and what they do

849
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:40,980
um self-reflection for an organization

850
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,799
is costly uh it doesn't happen all the

851
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,779
time but if there's enough kind of small

852
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,179
kiloton explosions uh you can actually

853
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:49,740
get that to happen

854
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,360
there's also another way of doing this

855
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,360
and that's by burning everything down

856
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,120
I don't recommend that 30 years of

857
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,299
experience not a good idea but I mean if

858
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,700
anyone has a real recent example of how

859
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,840
to do both

860
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,179
it's much

861
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,860
um you know we're letting the simmer

862
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,480
work through that process but you know

863
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,500
as somebody who's worked for An

864
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,580
Inspector General of the federal

865
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,440
government we have whistleblower

866
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,179
facilities for this but for publicly

867
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,740
traded companies like Twitter there's

868
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,419
the SEC

869
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,940
um and Congress and for others some of

870
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,260
your organizations may have an ombudsman

871
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,179
that will document issues and stuff like

872
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:25,980
that collect those things move that

873
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,779
forward as long as it's there that's a

874
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,340
chance that that those issues are

875
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,320
documented and you're kind of out of the

876
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,760
hot water at that point

877
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,159
but don't give up hope entirely

878
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,779
I'm gonna do a time check here real

879
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,179
quick just make sure I'm running long

880
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,340
um so again play with your management

881
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,080
and always win

882
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,299
management isn't as smart as you want to

883
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:47,159
give him credit for I went from a low

884
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,140
end systems engineer all the way up to a

885
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,600
C Level in the government

886
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,159
dumbest people I ever knew were in the

887
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:54,779
top levels of government because they've

888
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:55,919
just progressed that point where they're

889
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,960
just pushing paper and people around

890
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,179
and you're the smart person but don't

891
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:01,620
let it get to your head

892
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,140
a good leader will staff the

893
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,640
organization with people smarter than

894
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,159
them and I love Staffing people who are

895
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,020
way smarter than me because I got to

896
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,880
learn and listen to them and they told

897
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,980
me all the really cool and I love

898
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,360
that and I trust them I trust their

899
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,580
knowledge I trust their skills

900
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,380
but also knowing that but also

901
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,000
understand check your ego at the door

902
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,500
it'll help with the day-to-day work

903
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,240
allow you to understand your impact

904
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,559
without actually playing those types of

905
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,880
politics

906
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,860
Granite you'll actually have to play to

907
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,840
The Blind Side a couple times where you

908
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,399
may push a little bit softly and know

909
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,779
where you kind of need to push them over

910
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:34,820
the edge

911
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,020
recommending do not actually push them

912
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,760
over the edge down the stairs that's not

913
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,279
the way to progress up the ladder

914
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,500
um but some of this is actually also

915
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,779
loaded with some gender and age and

916
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:48,960
other kind of biases women minorities

917
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,820
and so forth some of these have

918
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,559
different qualifying things on there so

919
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,179
I'm going to gloss over that but just

920
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:56,580
make sure you're aware that you know

921
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,440
there's a modified every one of those

922
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,200
kind of comments on that one but in

923
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,179
those cases it's also useful to kind of

924
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:06,000
team up with other folks to basically

925
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,100
work on getting some momentum to get

926
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,260
yourself heard in some of those cases

927
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,000
you can find a peer find someone in

928
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,279
another department

929
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,659
I wouldn't recommend actually looking to

930
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,640
if you're a mid-level manager don't look

931
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,899
to your staff to carry your own water

932
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:21,059
that's kind of bad juju

933
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,980
um but you know definitely look for

934
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,659
other folks who are running in similar

935
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,600
issues brainstorm and move on from there

936
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,000
um but uh other times and again what I

937
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,679
mentioned about kind of the gender and

938
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,220
racial and other backgrounds uh we have

939
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:35,820
um

940
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,080
women in the audience will definitely

941
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,419
know the parenting you'll raise your

942
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,220
hand and say something in a meeting and

943
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,720
you'll be like hey this is a really good

944
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,480
idea and then Bob two shares down will

945
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,100
say the exact same thing and they'll go

946
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,960
great idea Bob

947
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,000
got to be careful about that one but you

948
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,740
if you can find some people other women

949
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,820
in the group they've actually done

950
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,260
they've documented this the White House

951
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,120
that they'll Echo that message that

952
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,399
parody of that message to emphasize that

953
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,740
yes we're all saying the same thing

954
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,820
together we're coming from this

955
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,500
perspective that's one other mechanism

956
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,940
to basically start carrying that message

957
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,279
forward but it's not there to raise them

958
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,200
up your peer or whatever even

959
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,240
potentially a male colleague and not

960
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,860
kneecap yourself

961
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,559
know what credit is worth fighting for

962
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,100
don't get Petty don't get greedy find

963
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,419
the highest value thing you want credit

964
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:24,600
for and focus and fight for that one

965
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,399
again as you see me gesticulating up

966
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,320
here Communications is more than waving

967
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,340
your hands

968
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,860
I know I've been beaten this to death in

969
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,080
other venues I've been back to my alumni

970
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,700
mentoring events and and so forth at my

971
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,340
alma mater and I usually tell if there's

972
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,200
any non-major specific training or

973
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,659
practice I would actually give anybody I

974
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:44,100
would say take a debate or speech class

975
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,679
and a writing class I've never underest

976
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:49,320
I over I underestimated how much writing

977
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,720
and communication I've had to do since

978
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,700
I've become kind of a professional with

979
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,039
the small P but quoted Fingers

980
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:56,700
um

981
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,620
you know much like people kind of joke

982
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,539
about schools not teaching life skills

983
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:03,059
like filing taxes letting young adults

984
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:04,799
know that no matter what career they end

985
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,020
up in communication skills are key those

986
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,700
are the things I'd say if you could

987
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,980
carry that back to your younger self

988
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,539
high schools if you go and volunteer

989
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,640
there or events here just let them know

990
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,559
and this goes from engineered all the

991
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,120
way up to a journalist or a programmer

992
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,659
if you don't get your ideas across well

993
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:22,980
all the items I mentioned you should be

994
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,200
doing about gaining support growing

995
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,640
involving the space or just all for

996
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,960
naught

997
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,740
no one to gesticulate though uh although

998
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,020
I recommend not using the bird too often

999
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,539
uh in meetings uh but you do have a

1000
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:37,860
right to get animated so you know it's

1001
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,720
like

1002
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,500
yes yay not

1003
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,120
 you too

1004
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,940
um properly exfoliating your excitement

1005
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,200
urgency or other attention to a point

1006
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,460
like I'm gonna go to the bathroom type

1007
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,440
kind of thing uh may get that into

1008
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,000
people but if you're grabbing their

1009
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,500
attention uh you got to do it at the

1010
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,600
right moment uh don't interrupt them

1011
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,480
don't tell them the you know years later

1012
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,279
like hey you know that meeting back in

1013
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,919
1994. yeah that idea yeah move that

1014
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,000
forward you got to find that right

1015
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,799
moment to strike

1016
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,419
this can also work for meetings and

1017
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:10,980
presentations

1018
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,539
um although this career space has been

1019
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:13,740
known with all these titles and stuff

1020
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,899
are very well known for catchy titles

1021
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:17,760
and memes and other Witnesses which I've

1022
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,059
extricated from my entire presentation

1023
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,799
um as I said earlier

1024
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,600
what gets you out of bed each morning

1025
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,580
may differ vastly from person to person

1026
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,279
or even your boss knowing what folks

1027
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,200
that have those different priorities is

1028
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,059
key to navigating the daily interaction

1029
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:34,919
with your personal and professional

1030
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:35,940
lives

1031
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,100
it's probably the essence of actually

1032
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,440
social engineering figure out what the

1033
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,539
end goal is and is obnoxious as Sports

1034
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:45,299
analogies are work out a game plan on

1035
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:46,860
how to be avoided being blocked and

1036
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,559
tackled when I was a CTO I work with

1037
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,880
business Representatives more than

1038
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,860
fighting with specific specific techies

1039
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,600
about a point I didn't want to get into

1040
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,740
a technical argument I want to go to the

1041
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,000
business person be like hey what do you

1042
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,080
want what do you need what are you

1043
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,039
starting with what are you finishing

1044
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,779
with

1045
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,640
um I knew my CIO boss was not as

1046
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,440
technical as I was which I'm not very

1047
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,539
technical so it means he was really not

1048
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,280
technical but I used similar business

1049
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,899
language to ensure he was on board in

1050
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:11,879
line with all the business units so it's

1051
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,560
a lot of this kind of observe and react

1052
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,619
type kind of uh interactions

1053
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,159
new slide yes it worked no updates yes

1054
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,839
um it's very easy to for technically

1055
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,280
minded people basically you think you

1056
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,839
can engineer your way out of everything

1057
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,300
whether it's technology use math or

1058
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,820
proper use of detonation material uh

1059
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,560
sadly as noted before communication

1060
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,719
skills are all the easiest and most

1061
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,639
precise to use but are also more

1062
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,800
fungible so it's finding the right tools

1063
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,599
to kind of wield in this place

1064
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,659
we're often not forging ahead uh sorry

1065
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,060
we are often 14 ahead sorry negative

1066
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,219
there introducing new tools Solutions

1067
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,440
gizmos so already muddled process and

1068
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,020
problem and often not taking that moment

1069
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,879
to kind of step back talk about it

1070
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,520
eliminate some things change or

1071
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,140
otherwise reconfigure the entire problem

1072
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,000
to get to that goal we just want to kind

1073
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,619
of slog ahead bang our head against the

1074
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:02,640
wall

1075
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,960
um but that's also assuming everybody

1076
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,820
can kind of use the same tools

1077
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,680
again for some folks language and other

1078
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,380
communication tools may be difficult

1079
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,820
um so assessing where you can meet in

1080
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,260
the middle or assist with bridging gaps

1081
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,420
will be absolutely Paramount

1082
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,160
some of the most amazing and rewarding

1083
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,280
work that can be done is Gap bridging uh

1084
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,780
as it generates an outcome of learning

1085
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,880
and adapting for me my current job I do

1086
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,320
a lot of bringing people together I

1087
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,000
don't get to do Hands-On keyboard as

1088
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,859
much anymore so beating your proverbial

1089
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:30,660
head against the wall just because it's

1090
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,820
the only thing you want or can do is

1091
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,220
going to be absolutely counterproductive

1092
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,960
sometimes it may just kind of be

1093
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,700
pivoting to the side and then going at

1094
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,320
it and trying to figure out the controls

1095
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,180
the console that's the thing is it's

1096
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,040
always you don't just want to kind of

1097
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,599
flog ahead you kind of may have to look

1098
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,040
at things at a different angle there's

1099
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,300
plenty of these movies where you know

1100
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,500
you look at something you move to the

1101
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,820
side and oh my gosh there's the path

1102
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,680
through that's the kind of the the route

1103
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,880
you need to be taking for a lot of

1104
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,079
things

1105
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,960
so again not everything can be solved or

1106
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,359
the popular term in the last 15 years

1107
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:03,660
has been disrupted uh or wants to be

1108
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,640
solved by applications of Technology

1109
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,280
sometimes if that Tech fails or it's too

1110
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,619
ubiquitous Uber

1111
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:11,820
um folks forget that the Alternatives

1112
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,320
have the ability to fall back on

1113
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,240
original methods rendering everything

1114
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,060
unusable and untenable so so planning a

1115
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,280
process with automation or a fancy UI

1116
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,579
may miss actual crucial and more organic

1117
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,980
ways and that methods or processes that

1118
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,900
we're moving along could be more

1119
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,880
resilient and optimized just because it

1120
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,619
has to be teched up

1121
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:32,339
um

1122
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:34,380
I just remember being able to stand and

1123
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,180
like wave down a taxi now I gotta fire

1124
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,940
up an app and just like worry about my

1125
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,619
credit card and worried about you know

1126
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:41,940
is the person who's gonna pick me up in

1127
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,140
the car going to kill me or something

1128
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,060
like that why does everything have to be

1129
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,099
teched up I don't know I've hated this

1130
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:48,839
trend for a while and right now I just

1131
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:49,920
think there's way too much money going

1132
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,140
to that philosophy and it's I'm glad

1133
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,339
we're in Indiana and not California

1134
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:55,200
because I would be pilloried so hard

1135
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,640
right now

1136
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,300
um

1137
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,760
but I do know we we have to reiterate

1138
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,560
the whole trust but verify it's the

1139
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,300
culture and our security in the hacking

1140
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,220
spaces that we have here since anytime

1141
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,320
we've taken things at face value we've

1142
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,480
often been proven wrong or harmed so you

1143
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,680
know we have the really kind of good

1144
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,300
mentality to start with here

1145
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,540
like how many would blindly like load in

1146
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,540
IDs rules or volume scan results or

1147
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,220
generic threat intelligence and make a

1148
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,020
crucial decision on that you wouldn't

1149
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,119
same thing with just throwing Tech at

1150
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,339
stuff think about like who's involved

1151
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:28,500
how it got that way and what your

1152
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,180
possible outcomes could be

1153
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,040
sometimes it's a lot simpler when you

1154
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,380
kind of like take a Beat

1155
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,760
and even take things away from the

1156
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,760
equation like factoring out

1157
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,280
so one of the things the last thing I've

1158
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,660
really kind of learned on this is

1159
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,359
learning how to ask for something I I

1160
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,980
you know it's

1161
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,960
my my spouse is in the audience that I

1162
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,700
want to call it out but a lot of times

1163
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,099
our our things are communicating we need

1164
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:55,079
to learn to ask for things stop doing

1165
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,820
things to do things

1166
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,880
and that starts to foster a really great

1167
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,260
relationship when you get past that

1168
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,359
point of just sitting in silence and and

1169
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,300
just being upset and when you learn to

1170
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,460
basically say hey I need this I need a

1171
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,680
moment alone uh I need some time to

1172
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,240
think on things that's the same way you

1173
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,400
should be behaving at work you can carry

1174
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,140
those tools forward in that way and

1175
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,119
it'll make your life so much better

1176
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,280
but besides learning to also say no and

1177
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,140
managing expectations

1178
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,780
um you got to learn to do this uh we're

1179
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,420
proud folks honestly we we wear pride In

1180
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,920
Our Sleeve and we'd like to toil away

1181
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,540
and we like to spin gold out of spit and

1182
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,760
baling wire and straw but there are

1183
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,619
times when it comes down to it that's

1184
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:36,060
when it's more efficient results in

1185
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,920
better outcomes if you actually ask for

1186
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,500
these resources I mean you know I I

1187
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,180
would basically hate to try to like

1188
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,859
protect my entire network with just like

1189
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:46,260
a pen and a pad of paper I've documented

1190
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,300
everything yes it's here have you

1191
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,700
stopped it no but it's documented

1192
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,980
now mind you you won't always get the uh

1193
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,720
resources you asked for but making

1194
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,099
others aware that there's a need can

1195
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,540
start a process that whole kind of like

1196
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,220
touching the Venn diagram circles here

1197
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,320
your sphere of influences

1198
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,640
um most Orcs are trying to spin away

1199
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,900
from these kind of gut-based

1200
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,520
decision-making Paradigm like Hey we're

1201
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,920
down to the wire uh what does Bob feel

1202
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,660
like I'm picking on if any of you people

1203
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,280
are named Bob I'm sorry it's just the

1204
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,480
first thing that comes to mind all the

1205
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,460
time but you know Bob over here feels

1206
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,720
this way and we've got like two minutes

1207
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,339
to make this decision all right we'll

1208
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:18,900
check with what Bob has to say and he'll

1209
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,280
say some something stupid because he's

1210
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,859
hungry and and we'll go about doing that

1211
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:25,020
you know it's just one of those things

1212
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,000
um but now you know we're moving towards

1213
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,920
database decision making bring up things

1214
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,140
to fix have the data to back it up um

1215
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,940
but also come with Solutions instead of

1216
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,220
just problems uh that's another thing

1217
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,800
I've learned immensely is like hey

1218
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,780
should be broken well okay this is what

1219
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,520
we're gonna do to fix it that's useful

1220
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,619
come with the data show things and that

1221
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,480
that raises your value

1222
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,140
um

1223
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,359
for me it's also kind of a way I give

1224
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:49,859
three options I do a gold silver and

1225
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:51,720
bronze plan as you will

1226
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,760
um the gold is the oh hey if we had all

1227
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,839
the money in the world all the resource

1228
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:55,740
in the world all the time in the world

1229
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,300
this is what would be a perfect role

1230
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,859
when you have rainbows and unicorns and

1231
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:00,300
little happy bunnies jumping all over

1232
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,440
the place

1233
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,640
um but it's usually too much to ask

1234
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,320
you're just basically like gold plating

1235
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,760
essentially

1236
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,020
um the bronze is like the worst case

1237
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,380
scenario like hey like I I know you know

1238
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,640
I'm going to be asking you for a couple

1239
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,619
pennies here

1240
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,180
um you know can you just spare a dime

1241
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,440
you know we can just keep this thing

1242
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,940
running it's on life support I know you

1243
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,500
don't want to do it but we got to do it

1244
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,400
and um and a lot of the stuff is like if

1245
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,900
you don't at least give it some cash

1246
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,119
it'll break and and move some you need

1247
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,940
some love and silver is kind of again

1248
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,560
that social engineering thing flip it in

1249
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,119
there like hey it's not the top level

1250
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,460
it's not the bottom level but it's

1251
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,780
exactly where you want it's that kind of

1252
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,760
Goldilocks spot the the right amount of

1253
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,020
cash to keep something going the right

1254
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,700
amount of people to to get things

1255
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,980
started and fleshed out

1256
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,359
and you most likely always end up

1257
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,520
getting the silver in most cases this is

1258
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,440
I'd say about 10 data points 10

1259
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,900
different jobs for me so you know I'm

1260
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,339
not going to extrapolate on a larger

1261
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,140
data set but that's worked for me and

1262
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,400
sometimes you may even get some of the

1263
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,780
gold options especially if someone has

1264
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,859
some extra money at the end of the year

1265
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,839
and you're like hey this person is able

1266
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:02,400
to execute on the silver plan let's give

1267
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,660
them a little bit more I don't know if

1268
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,700
there's a metal between silver and gold

1269
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,520
copper no something like that the copper

1270
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,740
plan uh Copper Top um yeah that would be

1271
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,660
also the the kind of way so you'll do

1272
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,240
that and sometimes it'll make it uh I'll

1273
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,760
surprisingly successful

1274
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,099
um but the key thing about that is

1275
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:21,359
getting leadership that make it feel

1276
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,619
like they've actually contributed

1277
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:24,119
there's a little bit that social

1278
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,859
engineering aspect of it is like oh hey

1279
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,260
we helped on this problem and instead of

1280
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,400
just making it go away they can actually

1281
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,720
see some tangible benefits because you

1282
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,460
have an execution and a plan

1283
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,920
so again this goes back don't jump

1284
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,900
around wave hands like hey you know we

1285
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,880
need to do this everything's on fire you

1286
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,500
know the dumpster is floating down the

1287
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,700
street with the flames and stuff like

1288
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,260
that or this is fine you know the little

1289
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,060
dog or whatever again I told you no

1290
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,560
memes doesn't mean I don't act them out

1291
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,180
um but uh you know again you got to play

1292
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,440
their game too they're they're working

1293
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,599
mind games on you as well

1294
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,339
so finally I think this is my my next

1295
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,079
the last slide here

1296
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,579
um so check on time make sure I'm not

1297
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:00,900
keeping you too long

1298
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,060
um volunteering for Effectiveness uh we

1299
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,140
saw the people here that was in purple

1300
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,339
shirts

1301
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:07,859
um it's great I love I love volunteering

1302
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,140
I volunteer a lot of conferences as well

1303
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,000
um and uh there's a couple different

1304
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,020
volunteering types there's the

1305
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,940
overzealous you see that parody a lot of

1306
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,619
times in TV shows where you have the

1307
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,180
person in the back there like hey you

1308
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,440
know calling me call me I got all the

1309
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,180
answers there's reluctant one which is

1310
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,099
kind of like all right yeah I'll I'll go

1311
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:24,780
lift this box or move this thing along

1312
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,280
and there's a sign on the ones who just

1313
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,540
kind of toil away

1314
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,099
some will just take on this extra work

1315
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:30,599
because it'll appear that they're eager

1316
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,040
and willing to do what's worthwhile to

1317
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,900
get ahead and improve the situation some

1318
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,220
of those are the ladder climbers some of

1319
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,599
those are just people who are awesome

1320
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:37,740
and good

1321
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,599
um there's plenty of those out there

1322
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,640
The Reluctant ones again as I said are

1323
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,660
kind of resigned and just kind of doing

1324
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,820
it because they're told to or voluntold

1325
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,440
I love that word

1326
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,180
um and figured out these you're gonna

1327
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,680
get it out of the way just like once

1328
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,240
it's done it's done it's out of the way

1329
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,680
and then the silent ones and actually

1330
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,960
Leslie Carhart uh had a really good

1331
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,760
tweet the other day about this which are

1332
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,060
the folks who will just jump in dig in

1333
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,700
silently toil away at this thing and

1334
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,140
um you know until they've affected that

1335
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,579
outcome and just you know they have

1336
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:07,500
enough motivation to keep going and what

1337
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,940
you've mentioned in her tweet there too

1338
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,339
was if you have all your peers and your

1339
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,540
management that aren't carrying their

1340
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,520
own weight they're going to totally be

1341
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,900
taking advantage of you in time so

1342
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,180
there's also times just let it fail and

1343
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,560
that's one thing I didn't insert my talk

1344
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,720
because this tweet was too new but I

1345
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,040
highly recommend going reading the Tweet

1346
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,140
thread it's really good

1347
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,640
um you too can fit in all these

1348
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,200
different categories uh it's also

1349
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,480
important to kind of recognize uh when

1350
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,160
you need to be a little bit of them

1351
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,240
um sometimes you need to be the

1352
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,859
reluctant one sometimes you need to be

1353
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:36,900
the overzealous one in other ones you

1354
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,480
just gotta do it like doing dishes

1355
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,500
um

1356
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,839
so the key thing is to evaluate what

1357
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:44,880
task or problem is at hand and see what

1358
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,440
you want to do and what's the outcome

1359
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,180
that you can affect so that'll throw you

1360
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,400
in those types of category uh being a

1361
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,560
spare body sometimes makes things harder

1362
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,200
especially if you've got nothing to add

1363
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,119
I know I will speak to the conference

1364
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,640
folks who volunteer at conferences uh I

1365
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,599
know there's a lot of standing around

1366
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,880
what can I do to help anything I can do

1367
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,560
without anything I can do to help and

1368
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,000
that's kind of the spare body syndrome a

1369
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,319
little bit but eventually they'll find a

1370
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,420
way to kind of put you out there but

1371
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,760
sometimes it's just gonna step back and

1372
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,200
move away

1373
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,520
um they don't actually ask for specific

1374
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,900
skill sets sometimes here other than

1375
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,700
maybe some networking folks and and some

1376
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,839
of the folks who have the skills in some

1377
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:20,400
of the villages but it's good to be a

1378
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,780
general volunteer

1379
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,640
um other times it's good to just step

1380
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,839
away and know when you're not helping

1381
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:27,000
again I don't want to call out my spouse

1382
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,040
but since they're here I go down in the

1383
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,240
garage a lot of times and ask to help

1384
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,920
and sometimes I'm making it worse so

1385
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,380
I'll step back and get out of the garage

1386
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,940
um so you know it's a good time to

1387
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,200
understand when you're not wanted and

1388
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,520
those are those are things I also

1389
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,319
recommend as well and they're going to

1390
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,640
come back at me a little bit later and

1391
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,319
say see you need to learn from the same

1392
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:45,119
same things you say

1393
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,500
um but this even goes for some of this

1394
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,720
our spare time stuff our Hobbies uh

1395
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,460
coding or programming activity as well

1396
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,960
as work you just need to know when you

1397
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,940
kind of kind of step away it takes a lot

1398
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,440
of spoons and brain Cycles to Be an

1399
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,300
Effective volunteer so don't be afraid

1400
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,940
to be a bystander Observer as well

1401
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,960
sometimes your best learning can occur

1402
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,099
there

1403
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,460
so again be clever be applied be helpful

1404
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,619
this ties again back to volunteering but

1405
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:09,119
also when you get asked or assigned to a

1406
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,280
team for some projects uh I know I

1407
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,599
learned to say I'm not what you want

1408
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,160
back during a major life experience in

1409
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,500
2011 when I was thrown on a project that

1410
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,540
I felt like my skills and role were a

1411
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,859
terrible match with the team and this is

1412
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:22,200
my government government work it took a

1413
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,220
few tasks for me to sit there and

1414
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,079
basically say hey man enough is enough

1415
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:27,960
I'm good I'm I'm I'm out and extracting

1416
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,760
myself in the team and activity I I know

1417
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,960
that probably didn't look great for

1418
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,579
management but it was also like I'm not

1419
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:34,619
making this any better so it's best to

1420
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:36,900
have me out of this

1421
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,119
um however conversely at other times you

1422
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,260
need to inject yourself into certain

1423
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,880
things if you deserve them kind of going

1424
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,040
awry or even ask to give something kind

1425
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,780
of a once over so this is maybe kind of

1426
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,300
the corollary to to Leslie's uh tweet

1427
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,920
from the other day

1428
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,660
um you know like before if you're doing

1429
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,480
this come with Solutions less unless I'm

1430
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,980
calling out some of the problems so if

1431
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,940
you're going to be asked to kind of

1432
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,619
volunteer spend a moment to kind of go

1433
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:00,180
and think through things and bring bring

1434
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,160
solutions to this by the time folks

1435
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,660
usually typically ask you for help

1436
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,220
they're already beating the problem and

1437
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,480
want some different perspectives on it

1438
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,160
so they'll select you because they want

1439
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,240
that different set of skills or

1440
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,339
experiences or fresh eyes or or fresh

1441
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:12,480
fingers that can get burned on the

1442
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,800
breadboard when you're soldering things

1443
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,500
like that don't load that over them but

1444
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,700
understand that you know they're

1445
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,020
bringing you in to be a scalpel to be

1446
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,819
very direct careful and meaningful about

1447
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:21,960
the kind of help that you're going to go

1448
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,280
and provide

1449
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,319
um and and basically think about like

1450
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:26,760
you know I'm not there to just kind of

1451
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,980
disturb the apple cart

1452
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,359
um don't be a bowl in China shop again

1453
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:32,339
essentially

1454
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:34,920
um don't be a mess uh and just don't do

1455
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,060
that to just stir things up that's

1456
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,280
that's the case too sometimes you hey I

1457
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,720
want to I want to be part of this thing

1458
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,460
and you just end up stirring the pot and

1459
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,020
it's just a instead of this really

1460
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,319
beautiful mix of uh cake batter that has

1461
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,760
the red Swirls and stuff and it's just

1462
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,099
this weird god-awful Pepto-Bismol pink

1463
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,800
it's just it's yeah

1464
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,579
um

1465
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:55,619
you know again you know if you do this

1466
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:56,880
you may not be asked to help again and

1467
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,200
maybe that's your ulterior motive you

1468
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,220
don't want to be asked to volunteer

1469
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,420
again

1470
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,640
um so you know it's one way to get out

1471
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,560
of being bothered but again uh you can

1472
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,119
lose respect among your peers and

1473
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:07,680
especially if it's a consistent

1474
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,140
interaction so you will not be asked to

1475
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,579
volunteer ever again

1476
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:12,540
um

1477
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,880
so I did a talk similar to this a few

1478
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,400
defcons ago called uh fire your Rick's

1479
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,140
at mental health hacking Village I don't

1480
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,900
know if any were all there but um I have

1481
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,700
open sources presentation I actually

1482
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,140
have to do more of a script for it but

1483
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,300
it's worked wonders in people who've

1484
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,520
ended up using it about identifying

1485
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,420
burnout

1486
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,920
um and organizations and the stress

1487
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,020
between folks who are a little too

1488
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,000
stressed and are brilliant and love to

1489
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,400
contribute and folks who

1490
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,619
um are realizing looking out from the

1491
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:41,640
outside in going this person's

1492
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,960
Troublemaker

1493
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,339
um so I would love to share that with

1494
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:46,380
folks in another time but it's an open

1495
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,819
source thing to kind of help with

1496
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:49,319
discussing burnout and you get to use

1497
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,780
Action Figures it's awesome

1498
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,380
um

1499
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,020
so again going back to the original part

1500
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,240
of the title here about hot takes uh you

1501
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,920
know if you have a hot take share it so

1502
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,500
it has some meaning uh probably 98 of

1503
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,480
you maybe less now because Twitter's on

1504
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,400
fire and Facebook sucks

1505
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,200
um it's just the nature of industry it's

1506
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,760
a Hallmark you know

1507
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,800
um we we like to to post there and say

1508
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,000
hey we've been there we've done that it

1509
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,920
sucks you know we're this sarcastic

1510
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,480
husks and professional bullshitters at

1511
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,180
this point but in that process hey we

1512
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,980
will say hey this is a hot take and

1513
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,480
we're often in a really good position to

1514
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,040
look at something we have policy experts

1515
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,060
we have people that are very deep

1516
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,740
technically on something we have folks

1517
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,119
who have years of experience on this

1518
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,119
stuff and um hey uh if you squint hard

1519
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:32,040
enough at this thing like maybe you can

1520
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,180
kind of like look at it something

1521
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,380
differently

1522
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,540
and uh you know you want to do that to

1523
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,740
get a little bit more out of it you want

1524
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,000
to poke and prod maybe you can kind of

1525
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,859
spur a conversation well beyond where it

1526
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:42,599
kind of ended

1527
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:44,099
um much like the subtitle of this talk

1528
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:46,140
the hot takes uh can't be just something

1529
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,480
you just throw out uh without context or

1530
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,819
an alternative or well research critique

1531
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:53,099
I know some of you want to do that like

1532
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:55,020
hey here's this big pile of poop I'm

1533
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,819
going to drop on Twitter deal with it

1534
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:59,579
don't just it can be funny it can be

1535
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:01,440
biting just because for many of us you

1536
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,880
know this career space that we find

1537
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,700
ourselves in isn't just a job but it's a

1538
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,560
passion it's something that you know

1539
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,940
really we were impassioned to kind of

1540
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,680
come and do you're here on a Friday

1541
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,359
you're here on a work day

1542
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:14,160
for some of you

1543
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,900
um you know and it you know we tend to

1544
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,220
get a little emotional we get a little

1545
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,680
irrational at times and yeah we see some

1546
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,240
stupid you know like some vendor

1547
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,619
booths at RSA

1548
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:23,940
um but we're fine we're calling that

1549
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,460
stuff out if you try to end up taking

1550
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,619
something down a notch or two try to be

1551
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:30,420
useful or at least somewhat funny with

1552
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,640
it I've seen several people go from

1553
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,800
taking a devil Devil's Advocate position

1554
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,619
uh mentality just to see how much storm

1555
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:40,020
and it can kick up and then they

1556
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,760
just start posting stupid all the

1557
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,839
time and their initials are NB and Naomi

1558
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:46,980
is the first name and you can figure out

1559
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,599
the rest of it

1560
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:49,700
um

1561
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,680
that I had respect for them initially

1562
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,060
and then they just started posting crap

1563
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,280
all the time and I I just I need to

1564
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,900
extricate myself from that because it

1565
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,960
just starts a whole tumbling mess of

1566
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,920
things

1567
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,859
but again extend your reach you're kind

1568
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:06,359
of like security astral projection

1569
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:07,680
you're like if you're not here in this

1570
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,359
place this is a way to kind of get your

1571
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,160
sphere of influence elsewhere

1572
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,660
it's more about planning ideas and

1573
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,920
Innovation and letting it grow and

1574
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,880
expand

1575
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,680
um yeah kind of infect the minds of

1576
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,480
others the kind of the head crap I guess

1577
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,700
there's a there's some video games like

1578
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,560
that hey video games

1579
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,599
um this is a matter of many winning mind

1580
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:27,240
share uh getting changed your ideas and

1581
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,700
deeds knowing that humans don't scale as

1582
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,560
well as ideas this is a carry-on get

1583
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,480
information into the hands of others uh

1584
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,859
much here at conferences I'm trying to

1585
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:36,540
instill infect all these things in your

1586
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,859
heads here

1587
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:39,420
um you know such a way of figuring out

1588
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,339
how to stop a piece of malware I know

1589
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:43,619
with uh Marcus that was the whole thing

1590
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:45,599
he's posted about how to stop the C2

1591
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,460
that was a great way of using that and

1592
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,680
spreading those ideas and you know he

1593
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,059
didn't really worry about credit or care

1594
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:52,680
he just wanted to make sure like this

1595
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,660
was fixed beyond the whole FBI thing

1596
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,160
later but you know there was that other

1597
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,619
side that was really cool

1598
00:50:58,619 --> 00:50:59,819
um there's some other mindfulness

1599
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:01,319
involved in all this kind of take that

1600
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:03,780
beat take that breath think about this

1601
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,160
um you know if there is a good outcome

1602
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,380
for me work your ideas uh the platitudes

1603
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,480
and respect will come back to you

1604
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,980
um you know there's there's no way to go

1605
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,240
out and kind of seek and demand it like

1606
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,280
hey I did this cool thing I did this

1607
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,440
awesome give me credit for it I

1608
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,180
want to be up on stage right now I want

1609
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,460
people tossing flowers at me free food

1610
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,020
hotels all sorts of other stuff thank

1611
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,760
you everybody for the hotel

1612
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,480
um

1613
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,760
but uh you know the other questions are

1614
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,859
well is like you know

1615
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:30,660
if people have questions about it

1616
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,339
they'll they'll find a way to get back

1617
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,420
to you they'll ask the question that's

1618
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,500
the other lovely thing about these

1619
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,640
social networks is if you've done

1620
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,599
something really cool and there's a

1621
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:37,980
couple questions it'll trickle back

1622
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,079
they'll they'll notice you so don't go

1623
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,640
out and kind of seek this stuff

1624
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,960
and it doesn't actually have to be

1625
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,240
technical either you can fix the process

1626
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,640
you can address a widely held attitude

1627
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,040
or misconception uh looking at a concept

1628
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,940
from a different point of view

1629
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,460
everything is open for contributions so

1630
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,319
even if you're not like a Tech head here

1631
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:57,720
you've got input you've got value to a

1632
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,040
lot of this stuff so find that way that

1633
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,359
you can do things

1634
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:02,940
and finally my thing here is you can

1635
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,460
call it out without being an you

1636
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,800
really can I'm a proverbial in

1637
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,559
most stories here prior to 2010 I was a

1638
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,359
bit more Meek I you know I was I was

1639
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:14,040
trying to affect some change but just

1640
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,420
kind of doing a little thing I want to

1641
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,400
grow and advance and expand but was more

1642
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,359
about kind of like squeezing through

1643
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:19,800
those small holes like oh I can get in

1644
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,059
here I can yeah I can get over here and

1645
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:23,460
stuff like that after 2010 and some

1646
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,579
changes in my life I had zero

1647
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:29,520
filter like I say say my mind and I

1648
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,619
realize in some cases when I'm existing

1649
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:35,040
in a space it may be the first last and

1650
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,079
only time I'm in that spot so if I'm

1651
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:38,640
ever there I'm gonna go and take that

1652
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,900
shot

1653
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,280
um if there's anything I want to impart

1654
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,980
here is take your shot when you got it

1655
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,900
um you'd be surprised the kind of ground

1656
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,540
you can make and get those ideas across

1657
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,220
it's also important to recognize kind of

1658
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,660
when to pass and when to shoot in this

1659
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,700
poor sorry about hey I'm in Indiana you

1660
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,980
guys have a great big basketball here

1661
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,599
um and when to be a team player and when

1662
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,040
to Grand stand a bit so you got to kind

1663
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,240
of fit you know where you're going to

1664
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,640
kind of be in in this role here

1665
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,780
um it goes back to language and

1666
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,079
communication style read the room uh I

1667
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:08,460
don't know how many people here but you

1668
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,140
know none of you are dozing out here any

1669
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,420
snoozing right now so that's good

1670
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,220
um but know your audience and know your

1671
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,300
topic and understand where your goals

1672
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,380
are on this one

1673
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,660
uh if it's a selfish way to kind of like

1674
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,640
highlight your ideas and yourself it's

1675
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,800
entirely the wrong tactic

1676
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,480
um you know if it's the further a goal

1677
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,559
uh for the greater good

1678
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,460
um then you're on the right track uh

1679
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,559
look for patterns uh if the loader

1680
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:33,119
concept may be too big to handle on your

1681
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:34,140
own

1682
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,640
um and and try to find people who can

1683
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,440
partner with on that uh it's okay to

1684
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,579
actually make this a team effort

1685
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:43,200
oh I'm really behind time now oh wait

1686
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,439
hold on

1687
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,180
oh yeah I'm I'm sorry I'm going to skip

1688
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,859
some stuff because we're going to run

1689
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,180
out of time here all right sorry about

1690
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,700
that I'm having too much fun up here

1691
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,500
um

1692
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,380
anyhow close to that there's there's a

1693
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,420
uh transcript online of this if you

1694
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,800
wanted to hear the longer version of it

1695
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,220
all but um and generally most of all

1696
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,440
these cases here are

1697
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,099
um you know

1698
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,260
could do the abbreviation here

1699
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,940
if you're curious

1700
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,400
Focus that like white hot laser

1701
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,540
beam

1702
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,400
um the the one thing about being as I

1703
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,960
mentioned earlier about being curious is

1704
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,640
that you may have a different take on

1705
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,920
things that other people do uh write it

1706
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,599
down document share it get a check on

1707
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:28,559
that

1708
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:29,280
um

1709
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,500
if it's a clever hack or clues that you

1710
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,480
have most of our organizations are glued

1711
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,559
together with these clever hacks

1712
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,780
includes that's research and development

1713
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,059
people ask you are you in r d yeah I'm

1714
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:41,099
in r d because I have this little script

1715
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:42,960
that I wrote a while ago I'm developing

1716
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,339
this to kind of save the organization

1717
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:46,740
document it make sure that's being able

1718
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,839
to be passed on to some other folks if

1719
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:51,119
you start off in operations where most

1720
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,680
of us started out and make sure it's

1721
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,640
documented because you're going to move

1722
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,960
on you're going to move up you're going

1723
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,220
to make the other person's life a lot

1724
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,260
easier if you go and do that

1725
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,059
and that gives you much more credit

1726
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:01,260
we're talking about credit and stuff

1727
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,640
where credit's due

1728
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,619
um so if you're able to kind of do that

1729
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:07,079
by all means uh you know focus on that

1730
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:08,400
because it just make your life and

1731
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,960
everybody's life easier and when they

1732
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,400
join you in the vaulted ranks after

1733
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,839
you've moved out to operations and moved

1734
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:14,040
up the ladder

1735
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,020
you know they'll think of you as you

1736
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,579
know the good brother the good sibling

1737
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:19,380
or whatever

1738
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,059
is that the is that the music that cut

1739
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:23,400
me off stage

1740
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,540
damn

1741
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,059
that's vicious

1742
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:28,440
I wasn't waiting for the Queens Another

1743
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,180
One Bites the Dust

1744
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:30,980
um

1745
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,660
too soon I know

1746
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,839
um

1747
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,540
yeah I think the last part I wanted to

1748
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,520
do here I'll yeah like I said I'm really

1749
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,599
sorry for running along I'm having a

1750
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:44,880
little bit too much fun up here um let's

1751
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,400
see yeah there's there's a lot more here

1752
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,740
um

1753
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,619
geez I had a lot more to talk about you

1754
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:54,960
um so I'll just touch on the thing that

1755
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,400
we always touch on here most career

1756
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,680
spaces have a level imposter syndrome uh

1757
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,420
I'm up here on stage I feel like I know

1758
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,040
absolutely nothing

1759
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,420
um my spouse probably thinks you know

1760
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,859
absolutely nothing so I'm like all right

1761
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:05,819
cool

1762
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:07,200
um I feel like I don't fit in a lot of

1763
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,760
times uh you know because I'm no longer

1764
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,859
really technical I'm really overwhelmed

1765
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:12,660
at work but if you got that same thing

1766
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,220
get that out of your head we all have

1767
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,900
something to contribute here

1768
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,160
um you all have a new way of looking at

1769
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,260
a problem or attacking a problem

1770
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,059
um so it's okay to kind of pivot um

1771
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:23,760
switch a new job pick a new gig focus on

1772
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,440
something else uh maybe something more

1773
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,940
entertaining more fun something to get

1774
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,079
you out of bed each morning other than

1775
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,240
alarm jokes again

1776
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,040
um some of the best hires I've ever had

1777
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,780
are non-tech folks uh you know I've

1778
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,760
hired journalism people I've hired other

1779
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,619
folks outside of that

1780
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:38,940
um some of the ones I'd say most

1781
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,980
inspiring for me in this space here are

1782
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,440
people like Katie masuris uh quadway

1783
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,180
Bergie who's over at DHS right now art

1784
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,160
Manion who used to be at sir I think he

1785
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,480
just left

1786
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,200
um

1787
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,240
and they can scrub it on both sides they

1788
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,559
can work kind of the policy side they

1789
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,059
can work on the tech side you know

1790
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:55,440
having that kind of diverse stuff is a

1791
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,780
really great uh bridging thing but also

1792
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,940
like Dan Greer from at stake he was a

1793
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,200
microbiologist before he got into

1794
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,839
security that was a great skill set to

1795
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:06,000
