1
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,340
how's everybody doing

2
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,960
isn't it great to be back here at Circle

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,640
City

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,099
I think this is probably the one

5
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,859
conference that had the longest

6
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,899
lay off because it's been three years

7
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,059
it's been over three years how many

8
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,559
people so this is their first Circle

9
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:38,820
City Town

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,980
welcome this has been good you guys like

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,099
it

12
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,700
I think my first Circle city con dates

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,379
are a little bit fuzzy for me because it

14
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,719
it's old and it's been a rough couple

15
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,340
years but I think it was 2015. uh but I

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,960
and this was technically the first

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,940
hacker conference that I ever spoke at

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,460
so I'm very honored to be able to have

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,519
the the privilege of being closing uh

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,200
Keynote

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,799
um

22
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,600
this is me if you ever want to get in

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,140

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,720

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,880
um I've had my phone up number up on

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,320
this slide for years and somebody

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,540
actually called me one time and we had I

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,979
was out on my front porch we had about

29
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,320
an hour conversation I can't promise

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,759
that every time because I usually don't

31
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,860
answer the phone if I don't recognize

32
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,560
the number but uh you know feel free to

33

um

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,579
be honest how many people have no idea

36
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,520
who I am never heard of me before okay

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,380

38
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,700

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,200
um

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,259
I have been in uh what I call the

41
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,180
information security industry in

42
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,479
business for I count 40 years now it's

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,060
close enough that I'm rounding up

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,759
um I my formative years we're working

45
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,159
with the Department of Defense I spent

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,320
10 years at the National Security Agency

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,259
I'll talk a little bit more about that

48
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,000
that's sort of the first part of this

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,180
talk uh came out into the private sector

50
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,760
about 26 years ago been doing security

51
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,580
Consulting in one way shape or form ever

52
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,440
since uh

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,080
spent a lot I've spent most of the last

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,879
20 years focused on something called the

55
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,060
payment card industry PCI any PCI fans

56
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,560
out there

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
not many

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,300
that's another talk for another day

59
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,080
um uh about gosh it's been nine years

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,480
ago now I went to work for a vendor

61
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,580
which I swore I would never do but I had

62
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,680
a friend that actually owned this little

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,019
company uh called tenable network

64
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,540
security uh that asked me to come work

65
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,519
for him and be a PCI subject matter

66
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,860
expert but he also since I've known him

67
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,080
for many years

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,780
uh asked me to be an evangelist for the

69
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,160
company and go out and do things like

70
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,140
speaker conferences that's how I kind of

71
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,780
got back into the hacker space and the

72
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,760
security space when you're a consultant

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,860
you're billable you don't get to go out

74
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,019
and play so I spent a lot of years not

75
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,959
doing any stuff like that

76
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,940
um before I get too far I do want to

77
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,860
give a quick acknowledge acknowledgment

78
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,300
to the company that I work for because

79
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,980
they let me be here they let me go out

80
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,080
and do this stuff and they actually pay

81
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,540
my way when reasonable and if I don't

82
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,280
abuse it so I work for a company called

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,739
online business systems I work in the

84
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,239
risk security and privacy practice

85
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,300
that's where I do the PCI stuff but you

86
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,400
know we're full service like many other

87
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,400
companies and we're very often hiring if

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,379
anybody's interested but this is not a

89
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,299
marketing pitch

90
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,019
um

91
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,060
since it's been a long time and since a

92
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,280
lot of this well how many people this is

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,400
like the first live thing you've done

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,739
and you know since that's weird covid

95
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,140
thing the last couple years a lot of us

96
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,420
I mean I've I've been to a smattering of

97
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,640
other events but as I said I think this

98
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,799
is the longest stretch three years over

99
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,519
three years between conferences

100
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,159
um apologize many of you don't know me

101
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,980
some of you do know me are aware that uh

102
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,920
last December my 13 year old

103
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,040
granddaughter Hannah uh was diagnosed

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,579
with Hodgkin's lymphoma so just to give

105
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,260
an update on that in case you haven't

106
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,300
heard because it's kind of been where my

107
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,340
head space has been most this last year

108
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,960
she went through six months of

109
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,940
chemotherapy and she is right now cancer

110
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,730
free

111
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,669
[Applause]

112
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,460
I will say this uh you know I know you

113
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,100
are various ages out there

114
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,800
um you expect to bury your parents

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,900
sibling is it's kind of a crap shoot

116
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,620
children suck grandchildren

117
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,300
a whole different

118
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,820
Stratosphere so I I appreciate the the

119
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,440
support that I've gotten from many of

120
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,639
you

121
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,120
um uh this past year uh also in this

122
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,720
past year I happened to turn 60 and uh

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,780
I'm not really happy about it

124
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,960
um but it is what it is I I still on the

125
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,580
inside feel like I'm the same person

126
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,040
that I was 40 years when I got ago when

127
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,500
I got into this business but uh

128
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,479
you know I don't think I passed for 30

129
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,780
anymore and I guess that's okay

130
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,100
um

131
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,860
in in in the before in the time between

132
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,639
you know last Circle City town and now

133
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,139
uh there's a book series that was

134
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,479
starting to be published I think back in

135
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,639
like 18 or 19 called tribe of hackers

136
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,320
anybody have ever heard of tribal

137
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,500
hackers if you haven't I I recommend it

138
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,940
I'll talk a little bit more about it

139
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,860
later but it's it's a series of books

140
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,560
that uh are interviews of a lot of

141
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,639
different people

142
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,860
from all various aspects of the cyber

143
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,320
security industry asking the same set of

144
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,120
questions so you know if you're a

145
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,860
contributor to this book you filled out

146
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,199
a questionnaire essentially and your

147
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,539
responses became a chapter in the book

148
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,180
uh there's four of them and I'm actually

149
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,460
one of two people that are in all four

150
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,620
of the books anybody know who the other

151
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,460
one is

152
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,380
I'm not going to tell you you have to

153
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,780
read all the books and find out

154
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,940
um I was also in the in between times

155
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,479
after to become a member of the board of

156
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,880
an organization called hack for kids

157
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,520
uh as as luck turns out and scheduling

158
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,100
turns out their uh big event was

159
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,080
yesterday up in Chicago and I had to

160
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,639
miss it because I had already committed

161
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,380
to being here but hack for kids

162
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,840
basically puts on hacker conferences but

163
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,080
kid oriented and kid focused so if you

164
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,479
have children uh feel free to look into

165
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,960
it based in Chicago uh we'll be a gurcon

166
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,900
up in Grand Rapids in October running a

167
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,940
conference I think we'd do Cypher con as

168
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,919
well which is Milwaukee and somebody

169
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,139
helped me out as of May April next year

170
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,020
March sometime next year

171
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,800
um

172
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,080
I mentioned I was uh

173
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,479
I've done PCI for a long time when I

174
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,280
went to work at tenable I sort of

175
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,340
stopped doing the active Consulting that

176
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,600
uh when kovid hit and uh my company very

177
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,940
fortunately was able to keep all of us

178
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,000
employed and yeah

179
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,539
but to make sure I was billable I I

180
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:23,280
conceded to becoming a qsa again a

181
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
qualified security assessor if you know

182
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
what that means it means you have to

183
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,819
have not one but two certifications in

184
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,520
order to be qualified uh didn't matter I

185
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,780
had 40 years of experience

186
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,340
but I don't say what my certifications

187
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,259
are publicly because I don't believe in

188
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,819
them that's a whole different topic for

189
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,620
a different day

190
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,160
um also in the in between time uh

191
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,560
gentlemen I met at Defcon a few years

192
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,560
ago he actually lives in the area and if

193
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,880
you happen to notice the lionfish

194
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,039
security booth that's his company he's

195
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,380
ex-special forces Special Forces was one

196
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,199
of my customers back in the NSA days and

197
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,060
uh because of work that I did for

198
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,460
Special Forces he was able to get me uh

199
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,759
into the Special Forces Association as a

200
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,759
an honorary lifetime member

201
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,560
um so that's kind of cool not a lot of

202
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,720
civilians do that

203
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,380
um

204
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,599
I met a guy named Paul acidorian in my

205
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,220
time at tenable he's been doing a

206
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,080
podcast called Paul's security weekly

207
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,479
for I think 16 years I started doing it

208
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,759
I think about seven years haven't been

209
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,139
doing it much lately because of the

210
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,060
granddaughter thing

211
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,458
um but he gave me my own show a couple

212
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,440
years ago called security and compliance

213
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,320
weekly uh and then we got bought out by

214
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,620
a corporate uh Behemoth and they

215
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,799
canceled my show unfortunately

216
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,800
um beginning of 2021 I think I was uh

217
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,100
interviewed on darknet Diaries telling

218
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,100
some of the stories from my NSA days uh

219
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,899
unfortunately I can't get to tell the

220
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,560
whole story today but uh uh you know go

221
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,600
listen to it and you'll you'll begin to

222
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,100
hear a little bit about why I'm up here

223
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,680
I also did another podcast called

224
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,080
malicious life telling you know

225
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,180
different angles of my NSA days

226
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,399
um also in in the interim which is kind

227
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,740
of where this talk came about was I

228
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,540
asked I was asked to be an advocate for

229
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,940
a group hacking is not a crime anybody

230
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,240
know about it affiliated with it

231
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,959
um their their big thing is all about uh

232
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,580
and I'll probably do a horrible job

233
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,640
paraphrasing it but um uh you know

234
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,959
they're basically think that the term

235
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,700
hacking or hacker has been

236
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,620
misappropriated and they want to make

237
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,120
sure that everybody understands that

238
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,820
hackers aren't just the bad guys that uh

239
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,560
you know we do good things we have good

240
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,380
motivations and all that kind of stuff

241
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,420
um but when I joined that and I started

242
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,860
reading through all the stuff that I'm

243
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,600
supposed to be ascribing to it got me

244
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,660
thinking about well you know I've met a

245
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,860
lot of people over the years at

246
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,399
conferences and uh I sometimes think

247
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,080
that the you know people that are

248
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,399
running around calling themselves

249
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,740
hackers perhaps are misappropriating the

250
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,600
term because I don't get the sense that

251
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,519
they're hackers and before you get

252
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,019
offended you know this is sort of the

253
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,740
topic today so bear with me as I kind of

254
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,980
go through my thought process with you

255
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,820
um

256
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,860
but uh

257
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,140
you know you don't have to read all the

258
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,760
fine print you can go out and find the

259
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,740
website but you know some some of the

260
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,540
stuff that I agree with is things that

261
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,240
they say I can read the small print but

262
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,220
you know they talk about hacking the

263
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,680
being more of a lifestyle and a mindset

264
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,920
and that's kind of where I am I I came

265
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,860
to the conclusion a few years ago that I

266
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,560
am a hacker I've always been a hacker I

267
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,779
was born a hacker

268
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,019
um doesn't mean that and I believe you

269
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,200
you are or you aren't a hacker uh

270
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,920
hopefully by the end of the day uh I and

271
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,079
I don't need you to agree with me or not

272
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,820
but hopefully you'll understand where

273
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,500
I'm coming from and you'll be able to

274
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,680
evaluate yourself and determine yes I am

275
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,860
a hacker and or no I'm maybe I'm not a

276
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,200
hacker I kind of believe a lot more of

277
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,360
us are hackers than we think we are and

278
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,899
part of that misappropriation is we that

279
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,779
are the hackers in this community

280
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,920
sometimes think that the hackers are

281
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,420
only the ones that are doing the pen

282
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,880
testing and the red teaming and popping

283
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,820
shells and finding you know all the cool

284
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,980
technical stuff I haven't done the

285
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,200
technical stuff in almost 20 years I

286
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,180
still believe I'm a hacker because I

287
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,880
think I've always been a hacker but you

288
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,440
know go go out to their website and

289
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,120
check it out

290
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,560
um but some of the stuff that they talk

291
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,200
about is uh and certainly I would agree

292
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,500
with is you know whatever this thing is

293
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,800
called being a hacker certainly uh

294
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,300
there's a lot of disagreement and

295
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,680
misunderstanding and different

296
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,399
definitions and terms uh the me you know

297
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,180
the the the movie industry uh certainly

298
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,519
is played a role in that

299
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,800
um you know the the Hollywood portrayal

300
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,800
of hackers kind of helps to build this

301
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,500
image that is often not what we think of

302
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,420
ourselves as

303
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,519
um there's women too uh

304
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,620
fortunately these slides are dated most

305
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,240
of these movies that are up there which

306
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,420
I think are classic and must-see movies

307
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,440
for our our community but younger the

308
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,140
audiences keep getting younger and and

309
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,620
uh I try to keep it up to date but I

310
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,839
don't always do that

311
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,800
um

312
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,200
hopefully most of you have seen these

313
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,660
movies so that we can we can have a good

314
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,579
vote but just out of curiosity there's

315
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,100
no right or wrong answer who thinks War

316
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,800
Games is the best hacker movie ever made

317
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,440
okay good crown

318
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,579
how about sneakers

319
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,060
verbal response okay

320
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,079
and hackers

321
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,880
all right

322
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,860
if any of you watch the podcast Paul and

323
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,660
I have sort of this running bet because

324
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,579
he thinks hackers is the best movie I

325
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,860
think sneakers is the best movie I think

326
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,380
in this audience I've won today and I'm

327
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,820
going to see him this week so I'm going

328
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,680
to make sure I tell them that there is

329
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,480
no right or wrong answer I think it's

330
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,180
actually interesting that uh when I talk

331
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,860
to people about what their favorite

332
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,320
hacker movie is it tells me a couple

333
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,540
things about them one is it kind of

334
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,360
gives me a rough idea of their age or

335
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,740
when they came into the community

336
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,180
there's some other subtle differences in

337
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,040
the movie but I mean if you think about

338
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,860
the red teaming pen testing part of this

339
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,899
industry that's all kind of based on

340
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,339
what they were doing in the movie

341
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,380
sneakers which came out it just had its

342
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,899
30th Anniversary somebody was telling me

343
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,880
this weekend uh you know in the last

344
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,560
week or two or a month or something like

345
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,599
that so what's that

346
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,779
yes uh if you haven't seen the movie go

347
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,279
watch it

348
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,279
um I think most of us would agree that

349
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,260
we have an image problem you know when I

350
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,000
was doing the research for this talk I

351
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,680
went out and you know are there lists of

352
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,660
the world's famous hackers best hackers

353
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,639
and there are and there's quite a few of

354
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,860
them there are hackers that are well

355
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,380
known and sometimes advertise themselves

356
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,339
as being the most famous hackers that uh

357
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,079
primarily are bad guys they're ones that

358
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,940
got in trouble broke the law got

359
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,060
arrested went to jail and nowadays are

360
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,760
hailed as Heroes uh I have opinions on

361
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,620
that I probably you know I won't go into

362
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,320
that too much but can we all agree maybe

363
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,420
that you know the image that's portrayed

364
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,360
needs to be worked on anybody disagree

365
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,339
with that

366
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,440
um of course the media doesn't help too

367
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,699
much

368
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,339
there is that classic image that we see

369
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,560
all the time

370
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,180
of what a hacker really is

371
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,339
but

372
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,139
how many how many black hoodies is too

373
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,740
many to own

374
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,240
seven I lose

375
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,279
I put this out on Twitter a while back

376
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,699
and somebody copied it and uh they they

377
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,920
labeled it you know like Sunday Monday

378
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,180
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday

379
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,638
Saturday weddings funerals specials

380
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,100
um but some of my thoughts on hacking

381
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,199
and again I I sort of try to take a

382
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,639
scientific approach and try to be

383
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,620
open-minded when I consider topics like

384
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,800
this uh I try not to infuse my bias but

385
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,660
I acknowledge that I do have a bias

386
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,339
because if I've taken the time to think

387
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,500
about something and make a conclusion I

388
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,019
kind of think I got the right answer

389
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,820
um which might be arrogant and I

390
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,339
apologize but I looked up the you know I

391
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:45,720
start with the dictionary what does the

392
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,579
dictionary you say is the definition of

393
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,680
hacker and I read that and I'm like why

394
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,660
are we having a discussion about this

395
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,060
why are we claiming to be hackers but

396
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,459
you know there's more definitions but

397
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:57,839
you know notice that the last definition

398
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,660
is the thing that kind of gets most of

399
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,639
us a little bit upset is that there is

400
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,320
this document it's even in the

401
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,060
dictionary perception that hackers are

402
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,220
bad guys

403
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,019
so

404
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,880
um

405
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,980
in the before times hasn't happened much

406
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,680
lately uh I would very often get

407
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,300
approached after talks or in

408
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,459
conversations with people especially

409
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,740
younger people wanting to get into the

410
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,420
business wanting to get into the

411
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,019
industry and it's usually some form of I

412
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,579
want to be a pen tester I want to be a

413
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,680
red teamer I want to be a hacker and

414
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,120
always in the back of my mind I'm

415
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,579
thinking if you have to ask

416
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:39,720
how to do that you might not be a hacker

417
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,060
um part of being a hacker at least to my

418
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,740
way of thinking and I had a conversation

419
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,740
about this with someone this weekend I

420
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,180
think one of the key elements or

421
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,060
indicators that you might be a hacker is

422
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,699
having a Natural Curiosity if you want

423
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,620
to be something and you're curious about

424
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,980
it you would figure out how to do it

425
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,259
that's my take on it

426
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,940
um

427
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,640
the other thing I thought of as I was

428
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,459
putting this talk together is on our

429
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,760
podcast when we interview people we

430
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,199
typically start the interview the

431
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,380
conversation with asking the person so

432
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,760
how'd you get your start in cyber

433
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,980
security and I certainly have answered

434
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,720
that question many times over the years

435
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,240
and I usually just say well I started at

436
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,500
NSA

437
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,299
but at some point I started thinking

438
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,860
especially putting together this talk

439
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,660
but that doesn't really tell the whole

440
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,880
story the the real answer to the

441
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,640
question at least to me is how did I get

442
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,860
to NSA

443
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,600
um so I started looking into that and

444
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,340
you know I mean I certainly know how I

445
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,840
got there but I started thinking about

446
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,539
it and this again where uh you know for

447
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:46,980
those that don't know me and don't don't

448
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,200
know my background bear with me for a

449
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,580
few minutes I'm just going to very

450
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,620
briefly run over some highlights I was

451
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,520
there at NSA from 1986 to 1996.

452
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,799
in my time there I became certified as a

453
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,160
cryptanalyst uh I was involved in at the

454
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,840
time what was called the defensive side

455
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,340
of the house which we actually called

456
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,919
information security there was the

457
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,660
offensive side of the house which was

458
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,940
called operations which is what mostly

459
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,700
NSA is known for you know stealing

460
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,620
Communications in those days it was

461
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,720
mostly intercepting Communications which

462
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,260
was mostly radio traffic out of the air

463
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,299
um and then later on I got involved it

464
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,559
was sort of the beginning of the

465
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,780
internet age and at least the internet

466
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,299
becoming publicly available and sneakers

467
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,160
had come out we started getting into

468
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,080
this whole idea of testing the security

469
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,940
of systems and networks by breaking into

470
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,220
them we called them vulnerability and

471
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,320
threat assessments but we referred to

472
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,000
ourselves as hackers and we were trying

473
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
to build the hacker culture but

474
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,140
when I started at NSA which was in 1986

475
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,480
I had never heard of NSA I grew up in

476
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Maryland and NSA is based in Maryland

477
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,900
um NSA at the time

478
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,960
uh was looking for very specific skill

479
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,380
sets they called them critical skills

480
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,760
mathematicians computer scientists

481
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,440
engineers

482
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,480
they would go out to college campuses

483
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,580
job fairs and recruit people hey

484
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,799
graduate you've got a job come to

485
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,380
Workforce I know many people that I work

486
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,360
with and I'm still involved with many of

487
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,100
them we have an alumni mailing list

488
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,440
email list

489
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,179
a lot of them didn't go through the

490
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,860
process that I went through they simply

491
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,840
showed up at a booth showed their resume

492
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,640
they had they got the degree they got

493
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,160
the job computer science

494
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,020
how many people are computer scientists

495
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,120
mathematics mathematicians or Engineers

496
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,140
here

497
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,820
very few I apologize I'm not uh upset at

498
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,460
you guys in particular but I I have

499
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,740
always been a little bit Frosty about

500
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,020
how as I'm going to tell you in the next

501
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,940
few minutes how all these people got

502
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,400
very special attention

503
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,059
um

504
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,900
my experience was I filled out an

505
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,820
application and it's the standard

506
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,740
application to work at any government

507
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,039
agency I mailed it in

508
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,260
um waited some number of weeks and was

509
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,000
invited to go to Fort Meade which is

510
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,700
where NSA is located to go through two

511
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,940
or three days of testing

512
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,780
um

513
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,419
had to have a physical had to have a

514
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,400
polygraph

515
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,240
um

516
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,220
physical exam was kind of weird but

517
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,900
that's another story psychological exam

518
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,160
but most of the time was spent doing

519
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,280
these skills tests what I what I learned

520
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,740
in my early days at NSA that what NSA

521
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,299
liked to look for in terms of people

522
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,940
that they were looking to recruit beyond

523
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,160
the critical skills primarily were

524
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,900
people with liberal arts degrees I

525
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,700
happened to go to a liberal arts college

526
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,299
so I I had that well-rounded balanced

527
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:49,559
education

528
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,140
but you know polygraph anybody ever had

529
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,000
a polygraph

530
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,559
a few people

531
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,780
it's not at all like they you see on TV

532
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,340
right

533
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,320
um but what was what always stood out to

534
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,600
me was the the aptitude test and that's

535
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,220
what I was focused on as I was putting

536
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,440
this talk together my favorite test that

537
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,400
I took

538
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,380
was they had this test where they would

539
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,140
show a geographic geometric shape a line

540
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,600
drawing similar to this and they would

541
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,400
simply ask you

542
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,440
what does this object look like from

543
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,539
behind or what does this object look

544
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,700
like from below or from the left or from

545
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,980
the right and I'm like oh that's cool

546
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,140
that's easy so I I you know I filled out

547
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,299
the test scored well apparently not

548
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,520
everybody can do this

549
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,020
um there was another test that was like

550
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,840
an artificial language it it it it was

551
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,760
not a Computing language but a spoken

552
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,679
language uh but it was a made-up

553
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,480
language and they would have all sorts

554
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,580
of it was all in the days of again

555
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,059
stealing messages and radio traffic

556
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:49,860
Communications so it was set up to look

557
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,720
like Communications traffic people

558
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,080
talking back and forth

559
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,400
and you were trying to you you were

560
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,200
asked what you know what looks like a

561
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,900
noun or what looks like a verb Can you

562
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,640
spot names you know all sorts of

563
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,039
different questions like that

564
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,679
um another test was more Communications

565
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,179
traffic but simply looking at the the uh

566
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,220
preambles of the messages which would be

567
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,179
something similar to packet headers to

568
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,000
put it in a more technical term or if

569
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,620
you remember the days where people

570
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,299
actually used to write letters and put

571
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,340
them in envelopes it would be the end

572
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,140
the information on the outside of the

573
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,000
envelope the to and from address and

574
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,039
things like that so you'd have

575
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,200
information like that available and you

576
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,600
were asked questions like you know can

577
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,460
you tell who's the boss can you tell who

578
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,500
the headquarters is can you tell who the

579
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,940
grunts are which way are the

580
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,940
communications going things like that

581
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,960
um

582
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,539
I scored well

583
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,400
I'm just grabbing my phone here real

584
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,620
quick so I can keep track of the time

585
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,840
uh I scored well enough that I was

586
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,960
offered a job and I'm like okay I'll go

587
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,900
to work at NSA uh it's hard to see this

588
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,520
is a printout from a DOT trip Matrix

589
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,500
printer from like 40 years ago or 35

590
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,260
years ago but on a scale of one to nine

591
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,780
I got mostly seven eighths and nines so

592
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,480
apparently that was pretty good score

593
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,140
um they had uh lots of job

594
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,720
classifications which was a military DOD

595
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,419
organization and every job you had at a

596
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,520
job calcification and for every job

597
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,039
classification they had a list of sort

598
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,620
of minimum scores that you needed to be

599
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,320
qualified to do the job and I've got

600
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,460
this

601
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,620
might have stolen it I don't know it was

602
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,679
not classified so I think I'm okay

603
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,140
um but you can see I mean most of the

604
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,179
most of the minimum minimum qualifying

605
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,460
scores were four or five sixes I was

606
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,200
seven eight nine so I guess they were

607
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,799
really happy to to hire me

608
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,780
um I tell a story if you want to go out

609
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,340
and find it on YouTube there's several

610
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,640
versions but I I put together a talk a

611
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,880
couple years ago actually a girl con uh

612
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,159
where I talk about what I did the first

613
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,620
couple years at NSA

614
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,720
um and I call it Tales from the Crypt

615
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,700
analyst because I started as a crypt

616
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,220
analyst I'm certified as a crypt analyst

617
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,960
it is the one certification I will

618
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,580
acknowledge

619
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,380
um there's stories to all this but just

620
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,400
as a highlight uh I was at NSA again

621
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,860
kind of pre-internet but certainly IBM

622
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,440
desktop personal computers were becoming

623
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,940
a thing

624
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,039
our primary form of secure

625
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,140
Communications back then the most secure

626
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,620
especially when talking to people that

627
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,320
were engaged in Espionage and spying

628
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,960
which was kind of our business they

629
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,220
would use something called a one-time

630
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,980
pass that paper thing there

631
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,520
um it is the most secure unbreakable

632
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,799
form of secure communication because

633
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,720
there's only two copies of the key one

634
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,760
on each end and as long as you don't

635
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,039
lose it or get it stolen or get it

636
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,980
copied and only use it once you can't

637
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,260
break the communication

638
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,000
um but I had a customer that was saying

639
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,400
you know we're writing out these long

640
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,559
messages and reports and doing it on

641
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,600
this most secure communication method

642
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,400
and these were the guys that were the

643
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,679
handlers the caseworkers not the spies

644
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,659
in the field who literally their

645
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,120
one-time pad was you know one inch by

646
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,919
two inches and they so they could hide

647
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,840
it in their shoe type of thing

648
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,640
they asked isn't there some way we could

649
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,380
on this computer do this encryption and

650
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,820
decryption thing because it takes us

651
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,679
three four five hours sometimes to do it

652
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:31,260
and I'm being young and naive not

653
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,640
knowing any better I said yeah that

654
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,039
makes sense we should do that so looking

655
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,720
back on it this was kind of my first

656
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,799
hack at NSA because NSA at the time

657
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:43,620
built little black boxes uh boxes were

658
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,960
you know plain text messages would come

659
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,779
out garbled scrambled ciphertext would

660
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:50,340
come out the other side

661
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,419
plain text in ciphertext out and most of

662
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,640
the ins and outs were you know voice

663
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,100
traffic whether it was radio or in some

664
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,799
cases telephone or in some cases typed

665
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,840
out messages

666
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,000
um it was all little black box stuff the

667
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,159
organization that I worked in this in

668
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,840
this infosec organization was

669
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,340
fundamentally an engineering

670
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,539
organization

671
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:15,179
and I had a chief scientist that told me

672
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,279
there's really no such thing as Hardware

673
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,799
all we do is I'm sorry there's no such

674
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,740
thing as software all we do is Hardware

675
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,080
but I took on the the project of trying

676
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,760
to come up with a way to write a

677
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,200
computer program that could do the

678
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,059
encryption and decryption and the way it

679
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,980
would make would make it work was that

680
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,100
one-time pad key had to be put on the

681
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,520
save icon I'm sorry the floppy disk and

682
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,640
a floppy disk then would become one half

683
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,460
of the of the of the secure

684
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,159
communication and of course uh if you're

685
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,080
using the paper pad you use the page at

686
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,640
a time and then you destroy it you rip

687
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,400
it up you eat it you burn it we had to

688
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,260
come up with a an equivalent way of

689
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,840
doing that electronically digitally on a

690
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,400
floppy disk

691
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,539
um

692
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,520
I had to go through sort of a design

693
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,860
engineering process it wasn't a software

694
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,480
development process it was a hardware

695
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,559
development process I had to present the

696
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,400
proposal to Senior Management uh so I'm

697
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,980
a young guy in my 20s meeting a bunch of

698
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,440
old mostly engineers and mathematicians

699
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,320
and scientists computer scientists or

700
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,640
engineers

701
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,640
old middle-aged men much like I am now

702
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,419
wearing suits pocket protectors slide

703
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,460
rules and I had to come in and Pitch

704
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,720
we're going to do something new and

705
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,760
different long story short they

706
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,700
reluctantly let me do it and we fielded

707
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,820
this Pro you know computer program to be

708
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,059
used on an IBM PC and we got the the key

709
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,940
the one-time pad key print it up on a

710
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,220
floppy disk so the best of my knowledge

711
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,799
this was the first time NSA produced a

712
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,140
software-based crypto system looking

713
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,820
back on it it might have been the last

714
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,500
because they really weren't happy with

715
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,840
it but I followed the rules that they

716
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,179
gave me and I was able to kind of get

717
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:06,840
through it more more on that story but

718
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,559
um

719
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,419
I mentioned the guy that got me into the

720
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,279
Special Forces Association what I did

721
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,080
for them was they had their own version

722
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,080
of one-time pad and their algorithm the

723
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,360
way they went from plain text to Cipher

724
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,940
was using what was called a visionnaire

725
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,580
table where you would have a way of

726
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,919
taking two letters the plain text and

727
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,080
the key and coming up with a unique

728
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,120
third letter which would be the cipher

729
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,279
and the way a visionnaire table works

730
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,279
which is a to z down row and column and

731
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,500
then the reverse of the alphabet at a

732
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,140
single offset on each line somehow

733
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,820
magically it produces unique

734
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,279
three-letter combinations so if you have

735
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,380
the second and third letter which you

736
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,360
have on the receiving end you get back

737
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,500
to the first

738
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,840
the way Special Forces guys would do it

739
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,279
is they would memorize all these

740
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,919
three-letter combinations which I didn't

741
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,679
wasn't about to do and the table was

742
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,600
difficult to use so I had just been

743
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,120
through uh introduction to history of

744
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,340
cryptography classes and I had learned

745
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,080
about Cipher Wheels I was like there

746
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,340
ought to be a way to make a Cipher wheel

747
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,679
long story short we came up with the

748
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,620
Cipher wheel we ended up making 15 000

749
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,000
of them and they were used by Special

750
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,779
Forces as near as I can tell for about

751
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:20,159
12 years

752
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,899
this is all in like the first two years

753
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:24,059
I'm at NSA

754
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,919
um

755
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,260
I became an intern which was sort of the

756
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,080
second phase of my career at NSA

757
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,159
um

758
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,899
quickly

759
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:34,799
um

760
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,919
I was in operations uh happened to be

761
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,020
during the time of Desert Shield Desert

762
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,760
Storm which was that first encounter in

763
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,279
the desert back in the early 90s that

764
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,100
only lasted like a week

765
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,980
and then I went to uh back to infosec

766
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,539
and I went to work for an organization

767
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,120
called fielded systems evaluations where

768
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,020
we were essentially doing uh you know

769
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,960
what NSA does on the operations side but

770
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,240
to our own systems under the premise of

771
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,500
we should really check and make sure

772
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,240
that everybody's using the systems that

773
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,399
we're producing which we think are the

774
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,200
most secure in the world make sure

775
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,120
they're using them correctly because the

776
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,059
way NSA really very often this is not

777
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,820
really a trade secret I hope but the way

778
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,120
we very often broke the systems of of

779
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,820
the adversary was taking advantage of

780
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,080
the fact that they didn't use them

781
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,960
correctly like to save paper and time

782
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,179
and money they would use a one-time pad

783
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:33,899
sheet for a week or for a month and when

784
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:35,760
you do that you introduce cryptographic

785
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,980
vulnerabilities that make it possible to

786
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,100
to break the the message and get back to

787
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,480
the messages which is what we're trying

788
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,980
to do

789
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,320
um if we were putting out little black

790
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,480
boxes that were supposed to be used in

791
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,580
sequence uh and never pushed the red

792
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,980
button you know what if somebody in the

793
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,899
field because the guy that's doing this

794
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,179
communication is probably 17 or 18 and

795
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,700
19 years old what if he finds a shortcut

796
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,159
so we would test and evaluate all that

797
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,140
stuff and that happened to be the time

798
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,820
when the internet was becoming a thing

799
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,620
so one of the things we were looking at

800
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,779
was Network systems and then Network

801
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:12,779
systems became systems that were going

802
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,059
out over the Internet so that's when I

803
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:18,000
got involved in vulnerability and threat

804
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,980
assessment or pen testing or what we now

805
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,860
more commonly call Red Team

806
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,020
so a couple years ago a book came out

807
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,179
called dark dark territory and in that

808
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,799
book in the fourth chapter which is

809
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,320
called eligible receiver there's this

810
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,059
paragraph

811
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,380
um that somewhere in the middle of it

812
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,760
and I always like to do a dramatic

813
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,799
reading

814
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:41,220
during its most sensitive drills

815
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,260
the red team worked out of a chamber

816
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,960
called the pit which was so secret that

817
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,539
few people at NSA knew it existed and

818
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,580
even they couldn't enter without first

819
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,880
passing through two combinations

820
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,360
well that sounds very fancy but uh

821
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,220
it happened to be that the guys that I

822
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,840
was working with that were essentially

823
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,059
the first red team we nicknamed our

824
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:06,299
office the pit and uh there were six of

825
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,039
us and

826
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,020
um we were just trying to like learn and

827
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,299
live the hacker culture and be cool and

828
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,940
different and nerdy and geeky and part

829
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,260
of that was

830
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,200
we we nicknamed our room I do not know

831
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,779
how we got from that to being named in a

832
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,000
book and I I don't know how to find that

833
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,340
out but but somehow we ended up being

834
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,799
part of the folklore

835
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,020
um we were doing that mostly for the dod

836
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,240
for classified systems frankly we did it

837
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,120
a lot internally we did it for bases

838
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,220
throughout the country

839
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,080
um but it was becoming more of a thing

840
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,260
and and people found out about it

841
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,240
um this is an article that was printed

842
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,399
in 1998 which is actually two years

843
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,980
after I left but you know it talks about

844
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,220
how uh you know NSA is doing stuff that

845
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,020
it shouldn't be doing this is really

846
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,520
stuff stuff that's supposed to be doing

847
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,700
by nist uh so we'd be worried about it

848
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,620
kind of sounds a little bit like

849
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,000
somebody else and something that

850
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,580
happened in the last couple years

851
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,399
um and I I was the first one doing it

852
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,960
because I was sort of the business

853
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,019
development manager of the pit and I was

854
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:15,419
the one working with as it turned out a

855
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,340
civilian agency called the Department of

856
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,340
Justice uh I kept a lot of documentation

857
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,440
uh because I ultimately got in trouble

858
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,380
uh and I wanted to preserve the evidence

859
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,299
but this is a letter that was from the

860
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,480
that was from the director of NSA to the

861
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,000
uh Attorney General of the U.S United

862
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,640
States and if you see at the bottom I am

863
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,860
the point of contact there

864
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,860
uh but before we could go do our

865
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,779
vulnerability and threat assessment the

866
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,840
doj was the victim of the first major

867
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,019
hack against the dod system in the world

868
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,600
and they got their website popped and

869
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,059
breached and there's archives of this

870
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:55,740
out there you can go find it they

871
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,779
replaced Janet Reno she was the Attorney

872
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:01,200
General her picture with Adolf Hitler it

873
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,360
gets a little bit NSFW if you scroll

874
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,760
down but you know this was a major

875
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,239
problem this was a major embarrassment

876
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,980
and I actually ended up taking a

877
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,899
forensics team down to try to help the

878
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,960
doj figure it out and that's where this

879
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,940
whole idea of well the NSA is not

880
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,679
supposed to do this kind of stuff kind

881
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,260
of came to a head and I got in trouble

882
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,179
and I I you know there's a whole story

883
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,179
about it but I let I ended up leaving

884
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,859
so that's what I did in the couple years

885
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,980
that I was at NSA uh hired because I

886
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,399
scored well on a test meanwhile the

887
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,080
hundreds of other and thousands of other

888
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,239
people that were hired by the NSA as

889
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,580
critical skills they started off by

890
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,879
getting paid more 10 15 20 30 more than

891
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,918
I did they were first in line for

892
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,480
promotions they were first in line for

893
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,339
the opportunity to go get an advanced

894
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,899
degree and have the government pay for

895
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,399
them and you were supposed to give your

896
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,379
government time back commensurate with

897
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,660
how much time you spent at education but

898
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,040
the clock was running at the same time

899
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,680
you were going so it was literally as

900
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,180
soon as they got a master's degree they

901
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,980
had to wait like a month and then they

902
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,480
could go out in the private sector which

903
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,119
they did to make even more money and yes

904
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,980
I'm still salty about that so it's not

905
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,859
you personally you guys that are

906
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:14,820
mathematicians and computer scientists

907
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,400
and Engineers but I had to fight for

908
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,980
everything that I did there and and and

909
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,599
I

910
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,579
I did not fit the norm of what they were

911
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,800
looking for and I think that means

912
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,200
something today especially because we

913
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,119
talk about the labor shortage and the

914
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,920
shortage of cyber Security Professionals

915
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,619
and we have to find people that have 15

916
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:37,260
years of advanced of experience for

917
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,060
beginner roles and they need to have

918
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,920
this degree in that degree and that

919
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,079
certification and that training and it's

920
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,180
a mess and that's part of where this

921
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,440
talk is going

922
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,300
but what impresses me uh with NSA

923
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,640
is that they knew how to find me

924
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,920
and I'm still doing the research on that

925
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,480
because I really don't know how they did

926
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,180
it but they did it they had a way of

927
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,579
weeding out and finding

928
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,339
aptitude and potential in me and they

929
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,680
were able to hire me some people call me

930
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,500
a unicorn maybe I am but I I'd like to

931
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,119
believe that there's more people like me

932
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,940
out there and in our modern contemporary

933
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,980
context I think there's a lot of people

934
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,960
out there that could be doing this job

935
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,300
but we don't ever consider them and look

936
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,160
at them because they don't fit the norm

937
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,960
and they don't fit the criteria of what

938
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,820
everybody's looking for you're with me

939
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,980
so far

940
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,660
so

941
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,800
how do I know I'm a hacker uh

942
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,140
let me put it out there for you play

943
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,599
along if you'd like but you know I I I I

944
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,180
I looked at myself and what is it about

945
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,359
me that coincidentally I think we're

946
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,119
indicators and things that NSA looked

947
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,300
for to hire somebody to do that job

948
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,560
strangely enough it seems to be a lot of

949
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,900
the same things that we think of as

950
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,520
people that would excel in this business

951
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:01,619
or or indicators of being a hacker so uh

952
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,180
one thing that I've always loved to do

953
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,119
is puzzles when I was a kid uh as a

954
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,980
whole family we would get this thing

955
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,599
called the Dell crossword puzzle

956
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,060
magazine we would buy one before we'd go

957
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,859
to the beach for a week and everybody

958
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,599
would pass it around on the beach and

959
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,099
take turns doing different kinds of

960
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,960
puzzles and it wasn't just crossword

961
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,780
puzzles there were crossword puzzles

962
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,579
where you didn't not only did you have

963
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,079
to find the words but you had to like

964
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,000
figure out what the grid was a little

965
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,680
bit more challenging love doing that

966
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,720
kind of stuff there were puzzles that

967
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,520
were kind of like cryptography Caesar

968
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,780
ciphers where you're trying to figure

969
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,160
out

970
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,520
um you know answers and unscrambling

971
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,500
things in fact they used to have this

972
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,640
there used to be a thing called the

973
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,320
newspaper anybody remember the newspaper

974
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,900
Funny Pages Funny Pages often had

975
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,760
puzzles in it and there was a daily

976
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,619
crypto quiz which was just a Caesar

977
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,020
sniper but it was a fun thing to try to

978
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,780
solve usually a famous quote you had to

979
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,940
learn how to do that kind of stuff these

980
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,040
days we have Wordle does anybody do

981
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,240
Wordle

982
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,460
I do it every day how about quartile

983
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,339
it's four at once love doing that

984
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,440
somebody asked me a couple weeks ago do

985
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,880
you think that's this is a recruiting

986
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,040
tool trying to say and it may very well

987
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,599
be

988
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:13,320
um

989
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,660
but my favorite thing to do in the

990
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,220
crossword puzzle book was something

991
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,900
called a logic problem

992
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,839
and uh all of us love to do it I'm the

993
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,060
youngest of four boys and my dad was

994
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,640
actually a physicist uh and I'm and

995
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,859
because I have daddy issues I never took

996
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:30,599
a physics class but that's another story

997
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,060
but we all we always used to love doing

998
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,560
the logic problems

999
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,260
and my dad would make us you know since

1000
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,320
it was a magazine and there was tables

1001
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,820
there that you would use to help fill

1002
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,040
out and solve the logic you know nobody

1003
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,540
was allowed to write in the book we all

1004
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,460
had to find graph paper or paper and

1005
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,920
redraw the table so we all had a chance

1006
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,000
to do it

1007
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,520
now interestingly

1008
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,920
um when I worked at NSA when I first

1009
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,859
started and I was looking for a job the

1010
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:01,020
office that I ended up in where I was

1011
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,240
doing the manual cryptography and

1012
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,040
designing the wheel and the

1013
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,260
software-based system there was a guy

1014
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,180
that was temporarily a sign there that

1015
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,400
was a crypto cryptanalyst from the

1016
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,440
operations side of the house but years

1017
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,540
ago he had been an intern and done a

1018
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,000
tour in this office and he was taking a

1019
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,920
diversity tour coming back and helping

1020
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,800
out so I met him this was one of the

1021
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,500
offices that I interviewed for and he

1022
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,420
sort of became my mentor took me under

1023
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,700
my wing and he one of the things he

1024
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,040
asked was where who else is talking to

1025
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,960
you because it wasn't really like job

1026
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,700
interviews it was like talking to a

1027
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,800
series of used car salesmen as it turned

1028
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,140
out it was weird but he kind of like

1029
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,880
helped me navigate and he's like no you

1030
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,020
don't want to work there no you don't

1031
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,579
want to work there actually this place

1032
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:46,140
is a kind of cool place to work and

1033
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,900
that's where I ended up working and you

1034
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,300
know the rest is history but strangely

1035
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,920
enough one of the things that this guy

1036
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,220
did as a hobby on the side was write

1037
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,140
logic problems

1038
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,879
for Dell crossword puzzle magazine

1039
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,200
um

1040
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,079
I'm left-handed so I'm raising my right

1041
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,119
hand I'm left-handed how many people in

1042
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,940
here are left-handed

1043
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,099
surprisingly few in this audience

1044
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:15,480
I don't know if you pay attention

1045
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,040
because if you're not left-handed you

1046
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,839
don't tend to pay attention but our

1047
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:20,940
industry seems to have a propensity for

1048
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,040
attracting left-handed people I don't

1049
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,480
know why but I think you know

1050
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,660
statistically 17 of the population is

1051
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,359
Left-Handed I'm very often in groups

1052
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,780
where you know it might be 30 50 I was

1053
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,280
at a dinner one time there's like eight

1054
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,920
people we were all left-handed I don't

1055
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,839
know what it is about left-handed but

1056
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,180
I'm left-handed

1057
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,880
um oops I went the wrong way

1058
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,099
I do have issues about being left-handed

1059
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:48,960
I'm sort of militant about it because

1060
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,079
the world is right-handed uh when I was

1061
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,180
in first grade one of the cool things in

1062
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,700
first grade was you got a school box and

1063
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,740
you got all sorts of you know pens and

1064
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,900
pencils and you got scissors and

1065
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,520
everybody else in the class got these

1066
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,599
pointy sharp tight scissors and I got

1067
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:10,260
this blunt loose Rusty Lefty scissors

1068
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,720
and they couldn't even they printed

1069
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,000
Lefty right-handed upside down on the

1070
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,020
things

1071
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,640
so all my life I've wanted to have

1072
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,440
left-handed scissors I do have them now

1073
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,960
but I've always kind of had issues with

1074
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,760
that

1075
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,800
um I don't fit in I don't feel like I

1076
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,079
fit in very often uh anybody else feel

1077
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,339
that way

1078
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:31,260
does it feel sometimes that we come

1079
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,000
together as a community because we are

1080
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,040
the island the misfit toy

1081
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,540
you were just talking to me about that

1082
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,700
earlier

1083
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,760
uh I don't like to be told no I don't

1084
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,220
like to be told I can't do something

1085
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,520
anybody else feel that way

1086
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,020
foreign

1087
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,420
this cartoon was given to me clipped out

1088
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,700
and it's somewhere in a box somewhere

1089
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,380
but I had a high school girlfriend that

1090
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,079
clipped this out and sent it to me and

1091
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,000
she out she obviously recognized

1092
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,640
something in 40 some odd years ago

1093
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,200
anybody else have trust issues

1094
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,579
um

1095
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,020
I count things

1096
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,500
I was when we were sitting outside uh

1097
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,780
you know talking I was counting the

1098
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,820
bricks on the post right in front of us

1099
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,040
I I count things if I'm driving on the

1100
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,200
highway I'll just start arbitrarily

1101
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,780
counting the lines the dotted lines I

1102
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,099
don't know when to start I don't know

1103
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:30,839
when to stop I just start counting them

1104
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,900
and just keep going and anytime I'm

1105
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,579
going up and down stairs I'm counting

1106
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:37,320
the stairs anybody else do anything

1107
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,880
weird like that

1108
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,359
it's so good to be in good company

1109
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:45,599
who knows who knows what CDO stands for

1110
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,140
yes

1111
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,339
yeah it's OCD but in alphabetical order

1112
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,079
um because I encounter all these

1113
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:58,079
difficulties in life uh I I sometimes

1114
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,119
come across as angry anybody else have

1115
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,839
anger issues

1116
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,060
be honest how many people rip this thing

1117
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,220
off

1118
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,500
how many people know people that oh my

1119
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,940
God you can't do that

1120
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,800
they are not the hackers in the world

1121
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,819
um a lot of people in this industry are

1122
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:20,220
musicians how many people are Musical

1123
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,380
I grew up in a musical family that's

1124
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,839
that's me wearing a hat that my brothers

1125
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,480
brought home from the New York World's

1126
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,079
Fair which was like I think 1965 or 66

1127
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,599
and they brought me a ukulele and I

1128
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,079
already I always knew I was left-handed

1129
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:38,339
um

1130
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,260
I don't know what to call this but

1131
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,819
because I think because of the

1132
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,339
discipline of doing logic problems I I I

1133
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:47,339
I look for logic flaws and things

1134
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:49,980
especially in processes

1135
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,240
um and

1136
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,119
I I don't know how I do it but I just

1137
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:56,160
see that I see the wrong

1138
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,920
and of course one of my problems which

1139
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,200
leads to the anger issues is once I see

1140
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,839
the wrong that's all I see and everybody

1141
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,300
else has got to see it too

1142
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,619
um

1143
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:09,240
and of course I have to tell people

1144
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,359
about it especially if they ask

1145
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:15,240
um which means I get fired a lot how

1146
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,619
many people have been fired at least

1147
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,859
once in their career

1148
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:23,040
two times three times four times five

1149
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,119
times

1150
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,000
I think I'm up to five

1151
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,060
um and then there's other various uh

1152
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,060
uh issues I have like I said I'm a

1153
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,040
little bit I'm a little bit Frosty I

1154
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,359
have a chip on my shoulder a little bit

1155
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,880
about how I was passed over at NSA and

1156
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,500
didn't get the promotions because they

1157
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,000
had to promote the other guys that were

1158
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,960
going to leave in a year anyway

1159
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,280
and of course hopefully most of us know

1160
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,300
the answer to this question right

1161
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,640
and I'm you know I don't think this is

1162
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,520
exhaustive this is just me doing

1163
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,260
introspection but from from audience

1164
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,940
response I feel like I'm in the right

1165
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,760
place that a lot of us are like this

1166
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,720
um

1167
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,760
but if you're not like that that's okay

1168
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,500
too because ultimately I think

1169
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,300
we need to

1170
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,640
figure out our potential and we need to

1171
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,740
find ways of finding the potential in

1172
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,440
people and there's lots of stuff to do

1173
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,839
in this industry that don't necessarily

1174
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:27,240
mean you have to be a hacker the way we

1175
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,160
think of hackers being you know Hands-On

1176
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,980
and breaking things and and doing all

1177
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,319
the technology stuff I mean I walked

1178
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,599
away from that almost 20 years ago and

1179
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,700
I've been sometimes people call it human

1180
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,420
hacking but that's been also co-opted

1181
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,099
um you know I try to work with

1182
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,020
organizations and work with people and

1183
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,020
try to help them be more secure and

1184
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,760
there's a challenge there's a puzzle

1185
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,520
every time I go into a new customer not

1186
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,020
because they don't have because they

1187
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,520
have new problems everybody's got the

1188
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,380
same problems but because there's

1189
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,819
different corporate cultures there's

1190
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:01,319
different personalities there's

1191
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:03,780
different Power structures and you know

1192
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,700
part of what I try to do is just sort of

1193
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,460
evaluate it and figure it all out it's a

1194
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,260
puzzle

1195
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,060
um I know I'm running out of time and I

1196
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,760
apologize but I am the closing Keynote

1197
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,099
so they have to wait

1198
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:18,420
um

1199
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,440
anybody know who this person is

1200
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,660
it's not Colonel Sanders number one

1201
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,579
answer still wrong

1202
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,980
uh gentleman named Robert fogum I don't

1203
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,599
even know when this book came out but

1204
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,940
it's a it's a great book anybody ever

1205
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,160
hear this book or read this book if you

1206
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,560
haven't I recommend reading it

1207
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,260
um uh you know it's basically I don't

1208
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,060
know I think he's a psychologist and

1209
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,740
he's he's spent a lot of time doing

1210
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,020
studies of young people and grown-ups

1211
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,819
and where things go wrong and stuff like

1212
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:50,400
that so all the life lessons that he

1213
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,780
learned in kindergarten that's sort of

1214
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,520
the premise of the book speaking of

1215
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,760
kindergarten uh here's a fun one this is

1216
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,040
my actual kindergarten class

1217
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,859
from uh can anybody read the date there

1218
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:04,140
it's like 1968.

1219
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,300
anybody want to try to guess

1220
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,680
who's me

1221
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,900
where am I in this photo don't take too

1222
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,540
long because we're running out of time

1223
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,579
sorry

1224
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:16,380
I spent a lot of time in the principal's

1225
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,700
office yes

1226
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,700
where am I anybody spot me in the crowd

1227
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,020
give up

1228
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,760
we can't take too long

1229
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,800
that's me right there I used to have

1230
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,980
hair

1231
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,859
but um

1232
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:33,780
I want to take a few minutes just to

1233
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,760
read something that this gentleman

1234
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,119
Robert fulgin wrote um

1235
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,700
so these are not my words but this is

1236
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,740
something that I I read years ago and

1237
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,200
sort of words to live by I apologize I'm

1238
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,720
reading to you but bear with me

1239
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,540
so he wrote over the last couple years I

1240
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,099
have been a frequent guest in schools

1241
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:55,020
most often invited by kindergartens and

1242
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,660
colleges the environments differ only in

1243
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,359
scale in The Beginner's classroom and on

1244
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:02,099
University campuses the same

1245
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:05,040
opportunities and Facilities exist tools

1246
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,140
for reading and writing are there words

1247
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,359
numbers areas devoted to scientific

1248
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,240
experiment labs and work boxes and those

1249
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,160
things necessary for the Arts paint

1250
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,520
music costumes dance room to dance

1251
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,440
likewise present and available

1252
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,500
in kindergarten however the resources

1253
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,260
are in one room with access for all in

1254
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,119
college the resources are in separate

1255
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,460
buildings with limited availability but

1256
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,319
the most apparent difference is in the

1257
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:33,720
self-image of the students ask a

1258
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,700
kindergarten class

1259
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,800
how many of you can draw all hands shoot

1260
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,579
up

1261
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:41,220
yes of course we can draw all of us what

1262
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,980
can you draw anything how about a dog

1263
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,740
eating a fire truck in a jungle sure how

1264
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,119
big do you want it

1268
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:57,359
words no problem we make them up let's

1269
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,300
sing now why not how many of you dance

1270
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,000
unanimous again what kind of music do

1271
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,339

1272
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:07,440
Dance Now sure why not I did that

1273
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,480
already do you like to act in plays yes

1274
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,760
do you play musical instruments yes do

1275
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,619
you write poetry yes can you read and

1276
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,599
write and count yes we're learning all

1277
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:16,980
that stuff now

1278
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,900
their answer is yes over and over again

1279
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,920
yes the children are confident in spirit

1280
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,740
infinite in resources and eager to learn

1281
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,200
everything is still possible

1282
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,119
try the same questions on a college

1283
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:32,220
audience a small percentage of the

1284
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,660
students will raise their hands when

1285
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,819
asked if they draw or dance or sing or

1286
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:38,099
paint or act or play an instrument not

1287
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:39,839
infrequently those who do raise their

1288
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,339
hands will want to qualify their

1289
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:44,520
response limit with limitations well I

1290
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,099
only play piano I only draw horses I

1291
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:49,619
only dance to rock and roll I only sing

1292
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,839
in the shower when asked why the

1293
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,940
limitations college students answer they

1294
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,460
do not have talent are not majoring in

1295
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,500
the subject or have not done any of

1296
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,599
these things since about third grade or

1297
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,000
worse that they are embarrassed for

1298
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,700
others to see them sing or dance or act

1299
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,220
you can imagine the response

1300
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,280
in an older audience the answer no none

1301
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,359
of the above

1302
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:15,660
so the question he asked is what went

1303
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,480
wrong between kindergarten and College

1304
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,700
what happened to yes

1305
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,280
of course I can

1306
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,200
so

1307
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,240
I could go on and on about this but time

1308
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,640
is running out to summarize

1309
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,760
I think you are you aren't hacker and if

1310
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,500
you are great and if you're not great

1311
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,839
more importantly

1312
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:39,300
figure out what it is that you're good

1313
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,579
at figure out what it is that you like

1314
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:42,480
to do

1315
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,480
hopefully if you're really lucky they're

1316
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,800
the same thing

1317
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,960
but my challenge to us as a community

1318
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,319
though and I'm I'm open to ideas I

1319
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,819
haven't figured this one out yet it's

1320
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:55,520
the puzzle that I'm working on right now

1321
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,680
what are ways that we can work on trying

1322
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,599
to find the potential

1323
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,880
and the aptitude in people especially

1324
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,920
the ones that aren't fitting into the

1325
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,440
preconceived notion of what we are

1326
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,059
supposed to be doing and looking like

1327
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:12,599
for all the roles in cyber security

1328
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:13,500
um

1329
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,140
I mentioned tribe of hackers you know at

1330
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,059
the beginning it's kind of what they

1331
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:19,800
captured in that book The the people

1332
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,020
that are all identified as hackers in

1333
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,300
that book very few of them are the ones

1334
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,819
that are running around in Black hoodies

1335
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:28,200
you know they haven't seen the light of

1336
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,859
day in in years they come from all walks

1337
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:34,079
of the cyber security realm and the I.T

1338
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,240
community and they're experts in their

1339
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,160
field and they all have stories I mean

1340
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,540
the questions asked in the book are like

1341
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,740
you know how did you get your start

1342
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,780
what's your favorite movie what's your

1343
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,040
biggest success what's your biggest

1344
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,440
failure but it's it's a whole cross

1345
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,559
spectrum of people but

1346
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:51,300
they had to do something to get where

1347
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,700
they were today which I think is the

1348
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,680
essence of being a hacker

1349
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,240
so

1350
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,079
um

1351
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,119
like I said let's figure out how we can

1352
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:02,099
do this and how we can find others and

1353
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:04,800
and hopefully uh be comfortable with

1354
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,660
ourselves with what we are and what we

1355
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,660
are not and and yeah I don't want to be

1356
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,099
a downer to anybody's like oh I guess

1357
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:12,780
I'm not a hacker no but you are

1358
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,220
something and you and you'd be good at

1359
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,660
what you do

1360
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,700
um that's kind of it any questions or

1361
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,020
comments

1362
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,740
yes sir

1363
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,940
hey do me a favor I don't know if it's

1364
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,680
illegal but so I can hear you

1365
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,380
right

1366
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,780
right

[Music]

1368
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,598
the

1369
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,980
um

1370
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,020
right

1371
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,559
I think absolutely something like that

1372
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:15,540
is needed I mean there's an old saying

1373
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,480
that the definition of insanity is doing

1374
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,099
the same thing over and over again

1375
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:23,099
expecting a different result and I would

1376
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,880
argue and you know let me go Sidetrack a

1377
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,440
minute we just have the Uber hack I

1378
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,940
don't know all the details but from what

1379
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,140
I've read and what I've heard a little

1380
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,300
bit running around social engineering

1381
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,640
attack I'm like okay what are the two

1382
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,740
main ways that people are breaking you

1383
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,359
know people bad guys breaking into

1384
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,760
organizations I would argue that it's

1385
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,859
something to do with passwords and it's

1386
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:45,720
something to do with trust and I would I

1387
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,359
would I would

1388
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,160
proofer to you that even social

1389
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,440
engineering is it falls under that

1390
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,020
category of trust relationships guess

1391
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:55,800
what

1392
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,020
when I started in this business 30 years

1393
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,359
ago what was the number two what way the

1394
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:03,359
two easiest ways we got in was passwords

1395
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,880
and exploiting Trust relationships so

1396
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,380
what the heck that's a whole other talk

1397
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,720
I guess what are we doing here

1398
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,099
um but yeah we need to try to do

1399
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:13,980
something different and and look and

1400
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,440
this is why I'm going I I I'm you know

1401
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,599
the world's been shut down and I haven't

1402
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:21,059
had access to people at NSA that I want

1403
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:23,280
to talk to but I want to try to get a

1404
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,319
hold of those tests and and are those

1405
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:27,660
tests still there and can we adapt them

1406
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,000
because those tests I think very much

1407
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,180
align to identifying me as a hacker as

1408
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,400
much as anything else and I would love

1409
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,319
to see stuff like that out in the

1410
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:38,700
community and don't don't just give it

1411
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,839
to people that are showing up at our

1412
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,700
conferences but go to all the different

1413
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,559
places I mean I've talked to people

1414
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:45,180
especially the last couple years with

1415
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,819
the shutdown you know people were losing

1416
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:49,980
their jobs and I know people that have

1417
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,720
been retraining people that like used to

1418
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,000
be waitresses in restaurants or cooks or

1419
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,559
you know just coming from different

1420
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:58,500
Industries but they displayed some sort

1421
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,920
of aptitude that that was recognized and

1422
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,940
they're flourishing and they're

1423
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:07,200
blossomed that's what we need more yes

Mississippi

1425
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:16,680
right

1426
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,260
well I wasn't an I.T guy because it

1427
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,839
didn't exist when I was growing up but

1428
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,220
you know

1429
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,380
having said that though I mean it helps

1430
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,180
to come out of the disciplines that

1431
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,740
you're going to work in but guess what

1432
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,960
this business we're in is not just about

1433
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,700
the technology it's about the whole

1434
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,940
business so it seems reasonable that we

1435
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,579
could pull people from every facet of a

1436
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:40,859
business or organization and they could

1437
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:43,200
succeed in doing stuff it's another

1438
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,180
topic for another time any other

1439
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,020
comments or questions

1440
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,300
you've had your share

1441
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,760
somebody else

1442
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,540
all right go ahead

1443
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,080

[Music]

1445
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,140
I think the cognitive blockers and I

1446
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,180
don't know if it's a chicken or egg

1447
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,940
thing but I think collectively in our

1448
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,040
industry

1449
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,559
in the industry that's impacted by cyber

1450
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,260
security so you know everything I think

1451
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,980
we have this belief that a security is

1452
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,619
somebody else's problem it's it's done

1453
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:42,480
for us

1454
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,559
um and we also have this belief that the

1455
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,780
technology will solve everything I think

1456
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,280
those are two of the big biggest

1457
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,920
cognitive blockers because if you don't

1458
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,480
think that you're good at the technology

1459
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,240
you don't think you can do this

1460
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,300
uh if you don't

1461
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,859
thank you

1462
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:04,020
it's sort of the lack of thinking I call

1463
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,359
it willful ignorance if you don't take

1464
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:08,520
personal responsibility in your actions

1465
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,319
whatever your job is because you think

1466
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,119
somebody else is doing it for you in the

1467
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:14,520
organization I think that's also a

1468
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,319
cognitive blocker it may not be what you

1469
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,940
were looking for but

1470
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,540
I hope that's an answer to your question

1471
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,500
okay

1472
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,180
anybody else questions or comments

1473
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:30,920
how many people are encouraged

1474
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:34,079
how many people need to go have a drink

1475
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,160
now and reconsider it

1476
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,579
um

1477
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:41,640
