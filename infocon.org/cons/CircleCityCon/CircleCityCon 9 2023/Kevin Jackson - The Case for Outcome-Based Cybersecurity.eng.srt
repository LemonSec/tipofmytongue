1
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,199
uh I'm Kevin Jackson and this is the

2
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,560
case for outcome-based cyber security

3
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,939
um we're on a little bit of a mission

4
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,600
this is one of those Mission based ideas

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,040
um from a little baby startup over in

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,200
Cincinnati called level six cyber

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,219
security

8
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,020
um this is not a sales pitch this is an

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,300
idea pitch and we're trying to circulate

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,420
an idea a new idea a revolutionary idea

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,719
in cyber security and get people to

12
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,640
think in a new way about how we

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
strategize how we plan how we execute

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,920
cyber security programs at the

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,020
management level at the approval level

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,300
at the budgeting level at the truly

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,319
strategic level and it's maybe ambitious

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,600
it may be crazily ambitious it takes a

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,920
lot of work it takes a lot of data takes

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,119
a lot of information but we think that's

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,420
a really good idea so we are really hard

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,100
really working hard to try to get this

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,060
concept out there and see if well if the

24
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,320
whole industry of all the different

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,939
Industries where cyber is important

26
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,040
which is every industry

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,259
um are able to buy in and take a hold of

28
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,420
this idea and help us run with it and

29
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,680
it's all about outcome-based cyber

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,860
security

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,659
so when the theme was announced as

32
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,100
Saturday morning cartoons I got really

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,060
happy

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,520
because I loved my Saturday morning

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,880
cartoons and some of my friends said No

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,619
One's Gonna understand Foghorn Leghorn

37
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,119
because they were all too young in your

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,500
crowd it's going to understand this

39
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,360
cartoon I said no because the guys who

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,560
named this Saturday morning cartoons

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,780
they remember this and I know that some

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,979
people are going to remember Foghorn

43
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,200
Leghorn so it just so happens that when

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,880
I was little and I was watching Saturday

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,579
morning cartoons that little guy not

46
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,200
Foghorn Lego one but the little guy

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,540
who's apparently called Egghead Junior I

48
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,759
always called him Egbert he was one of

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,060
my favorite things on Saturday morning

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,400
not just because he was always winning

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,560
the day which he was but because of how

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,319
he did it because I was a nerd shocker I

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,760
was a little tiny baby nerd I was

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
watching Saturday morning cartoons and

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,660
when he was around like learning

56
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,480
baseball from Foghorn Leghorn he won

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,379
every time because he used calculations

58
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,800
to do it and I was like yeah the Nerds

59
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,120
are winning he's doing calculations

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,060
Bring It On Egghead Junior was awesome

61
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,760
because you know big old rooster there

62
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,780
was showing him here's how you play

63
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,580
here's what you do he breaks out his pen

64
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,739
and paper and he throws a ball that goes

65
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,360
straight through the bat because he

66
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,459
calculated how to do it right up my

67
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,720
alley so when I was around that age

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,040
watching his cartoons I thought I was

69
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,959
going to be an astronaut I knew I was

70
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,340
going to be an aerospace engineer ended

71
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,599
up being an electrical engineer close

72
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,599
enough and I loved this

73
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,099
one on another of my favorites here

74
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,379
they're playing hide and seek I loved

75
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,300
this why because he brought out his

76
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,000
slide rule he brought his calculator he

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,800
wrote out some equations and he figured

78
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,660
out that if he dug a hole in the entire

79
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,099
different direction

80
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,319
he was going to bring Foghorn Leghorn

81
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,580
out of the ground at that spot and of

82
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,379
course it worked and he showed him the

83
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,360
math and then he showed his work I was a

84
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,860
big fan I'm seven years old I'm like hey

85
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,239
you got to show your work at the end to

86
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,180
get credit so he showed his work I Loved

87
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,959
These cartoons so when it came time to

88
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,720
talk about this little presentation here

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
at Circle city con and I saw Saturday

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,260
morning cartoons was a theme I said oh

91
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,780
I've got the perfect one because it fits

92
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,099
exactly with what I want to talk about

93
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:43,500
it is about why Egghead Jr always won he

94
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,299
always won he was awesome he was great

95
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,540
because he calculated everything

96
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,459
he calculated everything he calculated

97
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,860
baseball hide and seek he calculated how

98
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,140
to get fed he calculated how to win and

99
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,480
in whatever situation he was in and

100
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,659
that's what this talk is about what if

101
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,159
we calculate

102
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,319
everything I mean maybe not literally

103
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,599
everything but darn close what if we

104
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,739
calculate everything what if we

105
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:08,940
calculate

106
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,340
cyber security strategy

107
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,739
what if we give tools to the hands of

108
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,540
the decision makers the Cyber strategy

109
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,760
decision makers not necessarily the the

110
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,858
more tactical team members which is a

111
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,000
whole another set of disciplines that

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,560
are critically important but at the

113
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,900
decision maker level at the budgeting

114
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,419
level what if we can calculate

115
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,000
what the right approaches are what the

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,060
right decisions are based on real

117
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,759
factors Based on data that's what this

118
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,979
is all about so just like Egghead Junior

119
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,720
who I am proud to associate myself with

120
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,120
in a little tiny bit this morning just

121
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,100
like hit Egghead Junior what if we

122
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,560
calculate everything that's what this is

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,300
about

124
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,759
okay so real quick an agenda and I'm not

125
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,020
going to dwell on this because you'll

126
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,600
see it all but in a very broad terms we

127
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,580
want to talk about a little this crowd

128
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,380
is not necessary the ever-growing

129
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,360
challenge of cyber security a little bit

130
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,639
about how Ai and machine learning

131
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,160
basically how data analytics has become

132
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,040
so critical in cyber security and then

133
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,419
we want to shift a little bit and talk

134
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,220
about cyber strategy because I want to

135
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,100
mix data analytics and cyber strategy

136
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,620
hand in hand and talk about a new way to

137
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,520
going about using data to support cyber

138
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,680
strategy we're going to talk about what

139
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,740
I call the worldwide cyber security lab

140
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,560
and then a new term called business poly

141
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,699
intelligence

142
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:30,840
most everyone's heard of business

143
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,520
intelligence bi we're going to talk a

144
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,600
little bit about business poly

145
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,479
intelligence and how we could use data

146
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,100
analytics and AI

147
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,440
apply to cyber strategy data and then

148
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,520
we're going to wrap up by talking about

149
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,560
why all this is hard and it is a hard

150
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,180
problem we're trying to get the whole

151
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,639
world to start tackling but hard problem

152
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,380
is what we're all about just before we

153
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,539
started we were kind of

154
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,280
sitting together in the end those uh

155
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,660
those folks that are here with me on

156
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,520
from our team level six who are talking

157
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,500
about next Generation user interfaces

158
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,960
and as I usually do I looked at um

159
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,940
Jeremy and Drew and Daniel and I said

160
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,160
why don't we have user interfaces that

161
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,320
are like automatic holographic heads up

162
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,180
displays that are right in front of us

163
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,220
whenever we want so that I don't have to

164
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,020
bring out my phone in order to answer a

165
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,060
text like in the movie Minority Report

166
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,100
right when Tom Cruise is moving objects

167
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,960
around you see it maybe in other movies

168
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,820
where there's a full visual heads up

169
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,800
display and I said why don't we have

170
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,620
that now why can't I have a Graphic view

171
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,720
of my interface and I can make it

172
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,580
visible to only me or those around me

173
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,560
and it's three-dimensional and it's full

174
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,360
color and I can watch a video or I can

175
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,740
have it in my car I could switch it over

176
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,780
to a different mode in an airplane

177
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,220
and Jeremy looked at me and said that's

178
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,600
impossible went through glasses I'm like

179
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,800
well maybe through glasses what if we

180
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,660
just did it through light projected from

181
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,680
something we're naturally wearing

182
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,060
something non-invasive not contact

183
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,460
lenses maybe glasses but what if it was

184
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,440
just natural to something we're wearing

185
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,500
or to the area where our phone is

186
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,419
and the guys laughed at me because like

187
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,819
well how would you do it it's impossible

188
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,979
it may well be I don't care though what

189
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,539
I want to do is put that goal out there

190
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:01,800
and I want somebody to go figure out how

191
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,880
to do it

192
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,919
it's a hard problem I don't mind hard

193
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,020
problems what we're talking about in

194
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,780
this is a hard problem that may not be

195
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,400
so difficult to solve it's something we

196
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,280
can solve but I love putting out there

197
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,259
the goal so that smart people can start

198
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,699
working on it and start thinking about

199
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:18,900
it and we can start moving in that

200
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,818
direction even if it is a hard problem

201
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,520
so these first slides In This Crowd I

202
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,900
don't even know what we necessarily need

203
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,639
to dwell on them does anyone not know

204
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,800
that cyber security is hard

205
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,539
in this kind of environment we all know

206
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,160
the numbers we know the figures this is

207
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,840
one of you know the 30 different slides

208
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,440
of figures that every CSO puts up that

209
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,419
describes why it's a hard problem how

210
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,160
hard it is how expensive how many more

211
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,860
breaches how insurance is leaving

212
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,300
everyone stranded coming up with more

213
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,160
and more exceptions that latest that

214
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,840
everyone knows about of course the

215
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,580
potential exceptions for ransomware

216
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,500
breach coverages if it's a nation-state

217
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,180
actor involved because it's related to a

218
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,340
war potentially so yet another way that

219
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,660
you might not get supported and

220
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,280
ransomware from an insurance perspective

221
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,380
and on and on and on and on the rising

222
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,860
costs the complexity it's a ridiculously

223
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,199
complex situation and again I'm more

224
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,680
focusing on the the CSO level strategic

225
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,599
level because that's my background I'm a

226
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,280
virtual CSO now and have been for the

227
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,319
past five years or so I was a full-time

228
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,539
CSO for many years before that before

229
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,160
that I was an I.T Enterprise architect

230
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,020
and cyber security specialist for the

231
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,419
dod and then did some work in commercial

232
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,539
as well in compliance and cyber that's

233
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,059
where I come from it's even more complex

234
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,620
when you get to the lower levels when

235
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,700
you get to the Tactical when you get

236
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,440
under the hood there's a talk going on

237
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,659
next door to us right now that's about

238
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,760
protecting the Windows registry and when

239
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,320
you get down into those levels of

240
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,320
details about detection about response

241
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,300
about prevention about monitoring and

242
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,220
log management about incident response

243
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,019
about all the different tactical aspects

244
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,720
the complexity is exponential

245
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,940
so you have all these threats all these

246
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,459
complex internals to manage the Tactical

247
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,500
level and then you have this very

248
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,600
complex strategic level that needs to be

249
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,459
managed the decisions that have to be

250
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,300
made

251
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,820
we look at those challenges again at the

252
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,080
Strategic level

253
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,940
in three broad buckets and it's the

254
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,740
typical buckets you'll see of people

255
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,580
process and Technology human factors

256
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,040
operations factors technology factors

257
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,200
and I put some lists here basic bullet

258
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,180
items of some of the things that fall

259
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,760
into each of those dimensions of cyber

260
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,940
security they all apply at once and in a

261
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,680
best case scenario you've got a cyber

262
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,620
security program as a CSO that has a

263
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,320
balance of focus on all these areas that

264
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,940
pays attention to human factors and

265
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,399
culture change management to cyber

266
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,320
education to cyber branding cyber

267
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,660
culture emotional intelligence while

268
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,820
it's strong operationally and all the

269
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,800
processes and procedures and the

270
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,860
policies in the execution aspect of a

271
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,080
cyber security program while it's

272
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,640
supported by all the right technological

273
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,100
factors all the tech and tools of which

274
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,560
that's a list of that could be thousands

275
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,339
law

276
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,120
so very multi-dimensional very complex

277
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,420
with that as a starting point and I'm

278
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,680
not even going to dwell on this because

279
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,500
again you guys know it's an ugly picture

280
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,720
with that as a starting point let's talk

281
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,040
a little bit and this is one thing I

282
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,080
love about this whole talk let's talk a

283
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,360
little bit about Solutions

284
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,220
so something I usually complain about

285
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,140
behind closed doors of people on my team

286
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,899
it's so easy to do a cyber security talk

287
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,180
about how bad the problems are

288
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,700
and when we went to listen some of the

289
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,500
talks and some of the vendors of black

290
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,380
hat we went to isaka isaka's North

291
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,480
American Conference in New Orleans back

292
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,360
in May and we were at Blue Team con back

293
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,420
in Chicago just last month

294
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,300
so many of the talks are very useful but

295
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,399
focus on the problem and kind of end

296
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,920
with a solution that we have to find a

297
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,399
solution or we have to do better well we

298
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,019
want to talk about a solution at least

299
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,060
at the Strategic level again that might

300
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,459
be difficult but that can really we

301
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,380
think change the playing field and

302
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,240
provide answers where there haven't been

303
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,459
real answers before and we're talking

304
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,279
about using data to make that happen

305
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,440
so to make that transition let's talk

306
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,620
about a brief history of AI and how data

307
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,899
analytics AI machine learning have been

308
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,180
applied to cyber security Again In This

309
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,440
Crowd most of you know these things

310
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,440
already quick definitions data analytics

311
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,839
is all about extracting meaning from raw

312
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,720
data using tools more and more powerful

313
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,000
tools than a human can use much more

314
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,880
fast than a human can to extract data

315
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,600
Trends correlations from data AI then

316
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,360
leverages those same Technologies to

317
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,279
mimic the problem-solving capabilities

318
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,620
of a human artificially artificial

319
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,720
intelligence within AI you have machine

320
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,060
learning which is more about

321
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,640
the capability of a machine to imitate

322
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,800
intelligent human behaviors to actually

323
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,140
learn and respond in an intelligent way

324
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,959
now over the past few decades data

325
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,579
analytics of course became huge coming

326
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,800
right out of the 80s and 90s

327
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,540
artificial intelligence became a really

328
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,060
big thing coming into the 2000s and into

329
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,579
the the Decades of the of the teens

330
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,560
machine learning and its capabilities

331
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,380
have grown in lockstep because cloud

332
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,420
computing cheaper Computing cheaper

333
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,940
access to powerful processing and new

334
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,040
algorithms have made all of us more

335
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,440
reachable more understandable easier to

336
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,420
grasp the bar of Entry is much much

337
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,200
lower

338
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,880
and all of this has had a pretty big

339
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,880
impact within cyber security and again

340
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,279
at the Tactical level you're probably

341
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,160
pretty familiar with how data analytics

342
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,279
and a little bit of AI has impacted the

343
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,040
tech and tools Arenas email and breach

344
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,839
investigation intrusion detection and

345
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,279
vulnerability management

346
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,620
it massively in financial markets for

347
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,620
detecting fraud for detecting outliers

348
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,300
AI is great at that looking at massive

349
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,240
amounts of data Big Data Collections and

350
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,920
looking for the outliers looking for

351
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,620
trends of specific natures and then more

352
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,000
recently maybe in the last decade

353
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,860
getting better at better I have a

354
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,320
learning using machine learning what the

355
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,600
patterns are and what to look for and

356
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,120
recursively feeding that Loop so that

357
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,620
the detection schemes get better and

358
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,639
better

359
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,920
uh Sim tools and of course that do

360
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,079
actual data correlation across many many

361
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,380
different log aggregation sources that's

362
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,779
a big use of AI and machine learning to

363
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,000
help improve those statistics and of

364
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,800
course in Insider threats behavioral

365
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,680
analytics it's all a massive Improvement

366
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,120
in the last few years

367
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,339
but here's the thing

368
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,639
all of those applications of AI machine

369
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,860
learning data analytics they're very

370
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,100
tactical they're in a very specific

371
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,440
domain in a specific Silo and I'm not

372
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,540
saying that's bad it's a good thing that

373
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,220
the Technologies are there the tools are

374
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,620
there but is there a strategic

375
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,279
application to the power of AI that is

376
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,399
higher than is a given Silo not just for

377
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,860
email not just for spam detection not

378
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,220
just for Sim and log correlation but at

379
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,019
another level of abstraction or two

380
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,480
higher than the Tactical

381
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,720
why have we not seen much use of data

382
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,360
analytics and AI at the Strategic layer

383
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,860
so this next section I call

384
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,320
what is a cyber strategy and why every

385
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,600
organization has one

386
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,000
I remember I sat through a talk several

387
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,940
years ago before I started our current

388
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,700
company and it was a talk on how you

389
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,399
develop a cyber strategy and it was a

390
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,959
very good talk of presentation on the

391
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,060
steps for a mid-sized organization and

392
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,699
up to the Enterprise sale a scale on how

393
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,740
you start from scratch and build a cyber

394
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,360
strategy what are the components of your

395
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,620
strategy what are the domains you need

396
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,600
to look at how do you balance personnel

397
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,420
and budget and focus on specific threat

398
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,279
and threat management Concepts and

399
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,540
understanding the business and

400
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,760
integrating with the business becoming a

401
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,339
business enabler which is obviously the

402
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:00,839
should be the goal of every cyber

403
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,040
program

404
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,019
but I had one negative takeaway from

405
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,079
that talk because I didn't like the idea

406
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,680
that you had to go and find and create a

407
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,300
cyber strategy I was a little more of

408
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,699
the mindset that every company already

409
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,680
has a cyber strategy it just may be a

410
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,120
really bad one

411
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,000
like a lack of doing things

412
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,519
omitting things not understanding things

413
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,019
purposefully hiding your head in the

414
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,339
sand from things

415
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,680
that may well be your strategy it might

416
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,720
be a bad strategy but it may well be

417
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,519
your strategy

418
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,399
so from my perspective I kind of

419
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,199
formulated this opinion

420
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,720
and I think it's supported by evidence

421
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,820
that an organization cyber strategy is

422
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,279
really the sum of all of the cyber

423
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,320
security and security domain related

424
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,260
decisions that leadership makes

425
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,240
and that's all leadership not just the

426
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,579
CSO or not just the CIO or the it

427
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,199
manager that's responsible for cyber

428
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,420
security but the sum total of all the

429
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,300
decisions that affect Personnel

430
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,060
facilities policies and procedures uh

431
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,160
all the actions the business processes

432
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,560
themselves the corporate culture

433
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,019
the sum of all those decisions rather

434
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,120
their affirmative decisions omissions

435
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,220
gaps or plans

436
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,800
that's your cyber strategy

437
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,180
of course there's always that slight

438
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,399
twist people say that uh culture Trump

439
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,800
strategy I see culture as a big part of

440
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,600
determining what your strategy is

441
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,000
because what really happens the

442
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,980
decisions that are actually made I think

443
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,899
that's really your cyber strategy and a

444
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,820
very poor culture is going to help drive

445
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,980
a very poor

446
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,139
cyber security strategy

447
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,600
so with that in mind if we look at the

448
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,839
idea that if you've got an email address

449
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,759
you know a domain name

450
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,860
if you've got an LLC behind your name or

451
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,019
even you don't if you're doing something

452
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:51,959
as an organization to keep your people

453
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,240
your information secure and functioning

454
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,519
and up and running you have a cyber

455
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,500
strategy of some kind

456
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,540
someone is making all these decisions

457
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,419
and all of these relevant categories and

458
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,220
all of these domains they may be

459
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,900
terrible decisions maybe a lack of

460
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,179
decisions but someone's making these

461
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,679
decisions

462
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,980
if that's true what are people using as

463
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,380
a source for those decisions

464
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,540
again at the Enterprise level on down to

465
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,400
the very very small you know small

466
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,859
business where are they getting

467
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,740
the inputs to make these decisions the

468
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,960
easy to sim the example that is often

469
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,720
thrown around cyber security training

470
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,000
most people probably coming out of the

471
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,679
2000s and of the teens begin to embrace

472
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,120
the idea that you've got to do a cyber

473
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,280
awareness training event once a year

474
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,200
and that kind of became the thing and

475
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,100
then in all of the insurance

476
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,660
questionnaires and all of the general

477
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,580
rundowns there was a question do you do

478
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,840
an annual cyber security training you

479
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,360
click the Box yes where did that come

480
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,400
from doing that once a year is that a

481
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,660
good idea

482
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,600
is is that General understanding that

483
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,539
Trend that has became a kind of a truism

484
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,720
is that the is that the right answer and

485
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,760
where did that come from so of course we

486
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,559
have standards our standards give us a

487
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,320
lot of foundational information of what

488
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,260
to do what decisions to make at a high

489
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,400
level and sometimes a little more

490
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,660
prescriptively

491
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,059
with our cyber strategies we go to

492
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,980
conferences and that's why we're here

493
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,660
I've been going to conferences for my

494
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,039
whole career the first conferences I

495
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,400
went to were back in about 1994.

496
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,559
um because I'm really old and you know

497
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,419
going to back then DOD conferences for

498
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,220
the Air Force to learn things and bring

499
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,320
those back to help the organization one

500
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,120
conference one week you know next year

501
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,200
go to another conference for another

502
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,960
week now we've gone to full this is our

503
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,820
fifth conference in the last five months

504
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,640
personally it's been fun love it

505
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,520
and we're learning things right but what

506
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,780
exactly are we learning and how do we

507
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,460
apply it how do I know that my

508
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,840
conference what I learned from my

509
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,460
speaker how do you know what you're

510
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,039
learning right now from me is actually

511
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,860
better or worse than the guy next door

512
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,539
the conference on the west coast the

513
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,740
simultaneous conference is happening

514
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,600
right now in Japan you're not going to

515
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,160
know because you can't do all of them

516
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,720
and you can't take it all in you're

517
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,940
going to get what you can get your good

518
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,900
ideas

519
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,419
and get some assistance implementing and

520
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:13,860
try to do the best you can for your

521
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,820
program

522
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,679
headlines and articles professional

523
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,780
counsels friendly advice these things

524
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,940
are good and they matter but they are

525
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,580
very very piecemeal and they're siled

526
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,400
they are just what they are are they

527
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,919
right or wrong I don't know most csos

528
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,679
like me I was an upper mid Market CSO

529
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,240
for a pharmaceutical company they did a

530
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,980
billion dollars in business it only had

531
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,660
about 200 employees because they had a

532
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,980
great business model

533
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,539
I was making decisions left and right

534
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,220
for that cyber program and I used all

535
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,140
these kinds of sources but mostly I

536
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,080
relied on my experience the things I

537
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,240
liked and I knew that worked from prior

538
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,640
instances and working in cyber which

539
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,500
vendors did the best job at convincing

540
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,299
me their approach was great

541
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,280
what the headlines and trends of the day

542
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,960
were you know when people started

543
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,539
talking about moving to the cloud and

544
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:01,919
it's all everyone talked about you know

545
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,380
back in what was it 2015 we started

546
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,240
moving to the cloud when zero trust

547
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,380
became a thing everyone said oh we got

548
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,840
to do zero trust it's the trend of the

549
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,160
day I don't really know what it meant

550
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,500
but they love talking about the words

551
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,820
because it sounded so cool and they

552
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,860
could sell it to their bosses

553
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,360
how do we know those are the right

554
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,980
answers and then when we actually

555
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,419
Implement those things what are the

556
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:22,559
right ways to do them how do we get

557
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,840
these answers we hire Consultants which

558
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,760
I've been one for five years I love that

559
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,100
we hire Consultants it's great it keeps

560
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,539
my family fed

561
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,580
but then you're still getting a siled

562
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,140
best approach from one's source

563
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,720
what is missing is outcomes what if we

564
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,080
had data Centric performance information

565
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,820
for the strategies for the decisions

566
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,400
that we use to orient the bigger picture

567
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,660
program

568
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,799
and that's where we're going to try to

569
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,600
blend all this together by talking about

570
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,820
the worldwide security lab

571
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,220
so kind of like that floating in mid-air

572
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,160
user interface I described

573
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,559
we have a concept that we are broadly

574
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,059
talking about and trying to create

575
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:06,419
interest for about using the entire

576
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,980
world

577
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,500
as a cyber security lab

578
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,020
and the analogy I like to use is and

579
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,700
it's actually in an article that got

580
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,860
posted on the isaka website a few months

581
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,059
ago

582
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,340
what if you're an engineering team and a

583
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,720
manufacturing team and you're building

584
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,539
the next airliner okay you're building

585
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,700
the next really great big plane that's

586
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,620
going to move people and objects around

587
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,020
the world when you go to design an

588
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,140
airplane that needs to be so safe and so

589
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,940
secure and work so well and you're

590
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,280
making decisions say on what the

591
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,960
material structure will be for the

592
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,000
fuselage for the belly of the plane for

593
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,200
the wings

594
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,840
are you going to just look at what the

595
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,000
great Trends are at the time and what

596
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,320
you're familiar with and what you're

597
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,120
comfortable with and go with those

598
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,159
designs and build it and then put people

599
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:55,500
in it and fly it right away

600
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,419
that's not how engineering is done and

601
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,520
again I'm an engineer by by Nature so

602
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,559
this really kind of works for me

603
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,059
conceptually because I know that when

604
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,860
you go to build something that's a

605
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,260
critical component of an aircraft or

606
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,299
something else where safety is key you

607
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,120
do a lot of tests you get that material

608
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,799
you structure it you build it you

609
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,260
reinforce it and you test it you put it

610
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,720
under pressure you beat on it you drop

611
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,360
it you stomp on it you catch it on fire

612
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,520
you find all the ways it will fail you

613
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,860
know all those failure mode analyzes you

614
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,679
do all the math you simulate it until

615
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,740
you see what the actual outcomes are and

616
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,659
you go back and you tweak it if it fails

617
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:35,280
and you do it again if it fails worse

618
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,679
you try something else and you iterate

619
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,900
on that forever in a day until you get a

620
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,860
design

621
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,799
a structure in the right materials that

622
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,840
are safe and secure

623
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,240
it's a test bed right in engineering you

624
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,120
use test beds and you use data from test

625
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,700
physical tests simulations so you so

626
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,320
that you know that your approach

627
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,440
actually produces good results

628
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,159
well guess what the entire world is full

629
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,520
of organizations doing cyber security

630
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,100
because for our earlier slide everyone's

631
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,900
got a cyber strategy

632
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,299
everyone's doing something or failing to

633
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,419
do something and they're getting results

634
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,159
you blend that with the idea that we

635
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,140
have data analytics we have ai we have

636
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,059
tools that can look at correlations

637
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:24,120
between data points and other data

638
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,220
points and can learn those Trends over

639
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,980
time and that's where this concept comes

640
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,640
from

641
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,120
what if we looked at the world's

642
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,860
organizations of any type in any

643
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,980
industry public or private as that test

644
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,880
bed

645
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,780
as a live test bed that is testing

646
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,299
cyber security strategies there's

647
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,799
companies out there that are instead of

648
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,960
doing training every year or doing it

649
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,580
every month there's some that are doing

650
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,559
it weekly via email there's some that

651
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,299
haven't started doing training yet

652
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,620
there's some that are using third

653
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,299
parties that come in and teach people in

654
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:58,980
person there's some that are buying of

655
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,200
course know before and using pre-canned

656
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,760
videos or one of them will force

657
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,260
competitors using their can videos or

658
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,179
some that are mixing these things there

659
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,860
are some companies that are instead

660
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,480
using their internal staff to deliver

661
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,740
training

662
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,080
there are some that are doing this and

663
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,880
are making it separate for the

664
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,039
executives and doing really in-depth

665
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,480
training for the executives and their

666
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,860
key personnel

667
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,140
there's some that join it with a massive

668
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,600
amount of repercussions if you miss your

669
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,880
training and they're using threats there

670
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,140
are some that are using carrots and

671
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,539
offering gifts benefits gift cards if

672
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:31,620
you do

673
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,960
all those decisions

674
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,600
decide what your cyber security training

675
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,480
strategy are or is right

676
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,700
every one of those combinations of

677
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,919
decisions is going to have a correlation

678
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,740
to a certain set of outcomes

679
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,799
there are hundreds of thousands to

680
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,260
millions of companies doing cyber

681
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,480
training in different ways with

682
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,400
different tweaks on all those levers you

683
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,260
can pull and they're going to be getting

684
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,640
different outcomes and when they change

685
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,260
things the outcomes might change the

686
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,320
actual Behavior dynamics of the users

687
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,360
are going to get affected positively or

688
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,700
negatively over time based on those

689
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,580
changes if we can collect the data from

690
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,140
the worldwide lab at a high level

691
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,480
anonymously and begin to correlate how

692
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,980
the changes of different strategies

693
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,820
affect the outcomes then we can have

694
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,580
what Eggbert Jr and Foghorn Leghorn land

695
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,039
would call a calculated

696
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,440
set of results for what works best in

697
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,720
cyber training and then we can expand

698
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,940
that to all the other domains we can

699
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,039
figure out and see data wise what

700
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,380
actually works best for a given industry

701
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,600
a given company a given set of people a

702
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,179
given level of organizational complexity

703
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,400
if we can parameterize all of those

704
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,960
things

705
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,600
then we can really calculate the best

706
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,140
results we can calculate everything

707
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,760
which is again

708
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,340
my Egbert Junior Egghead Junior Foghorn

709
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,260
Leghorn analogy

710
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,500
so cyber strategies in general again

711
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,840
it's not just your information security

712
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,760
mission and vision which again a lot of

713
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,840
people say that's a key part of your

714
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,299
strategy that's fine your risk

715
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:14,039
management program your risk-based

716
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,559
program that's absolutely but it's more

717
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,179
than that it's more than all the project

718
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,640
plans in your roadmap it's more than

719
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,919
your objectives again if it's the

720
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:24,840
decisions that you make in your cyber

721
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,520
program that really are your cyber

722
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,940
strategy then why don't we apply data

723
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,820
analytics to that

724
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,299
collection of decisions

725
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:39,120
so now we get to our closing section

726
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,380
here

727
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,820
business intelligence again everybody

728
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,799
knows about

729
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,659
that's a given company

730
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,100
they've got a bunch of data they've got

731
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,779
marketing data they've got sales data

732
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,600
they've got information about how they

733
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,340
uh structure their supply chain how they

734
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,039
generate Revenue where their losses are

735
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,200
and they analyze that in a bi platform

736
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,299
they'll use Tableau they use power bi

737
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,279
whatever and it's business intelligence

738
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:06,240
bis data analytics for a company

739
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,360
business poly intelligence looks at data

740
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,120
analytics across lots of companies for

741
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,520
example every company that has a cyber

742
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,700
security program collects that data

743
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,880
in a multi-industry multi-company way

744
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,880
and does poly intelligence analysis on

745
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,820
much much more broad data sets and

746
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,080
that's

747
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,080
the big idea that we're talking about

748
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,020
we can gather massive amounts of

749
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,720
worldwide lab data on Cyber strategy

750
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,200
again the decisions made on Cyber gather

751
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,039
the resulting cyber outcome information

752
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,080
anonymously from the same sources

753
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,360
and perform business poly intelligence

754
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,980
analyzes

755
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,080
on that data to determine what decisions

756
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,200
lead to the best outcomes based on that

757
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,299
data and then it gets even more fun

758
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,779
because we can correlate cost with that

759
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,880
it's not very hard

760
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,419
to estimate or to calculate the cost

761
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:09,360
profile of a given cyber strategy and

762
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,059
look at the outcomes breaches near

763
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,440
misses

764
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,299
lack of breaches and lack of near

765
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,860
whatever it might be the different

766
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,720
outcomes the cost of the program the

767
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,059
cost of tools cost of personnel and the

768
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,679
impacts of negative things when they

769
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:25,559
happen and correlate those with specific

770
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,900
cyber strategies if you have that then

771
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,419
you can calculate Roi

772
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,460
you can calculate return on investment

773
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,059
through cost avoidance loss avoidance

774
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:38,640
and real cost of investment of a

775
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,919
specific cyber strategy

776
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,960
and then you can use Ai and you can

777
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,179
train an artificial intelligence engine

778
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:48,240
to learn those Trends over time

779
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,539
in every cyber domain and across cyber

780
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:54,440
security domains

781
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,880
so how do we get there

782
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,100
to analyze the worldwide lab cyber

783
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,659
strategy data you'd have to have it in a

784
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,340
consistent repeatable format you have to

785
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,140
parameterize

786
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,720
cyber strategy change all of those

787
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,299
hundreds thousands of decisions that you

788
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:10,500
can make

789
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,360
as a cyber security decision maker into

790
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,059
parameters into measurables and gather

791
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,760
those the cool thing is a lot of this is

792
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,919
actually open source there's open source

793
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,179
intelligence that organizations

794
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,220
willingly share about what their cyber

795
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,020
strategies are and thanks to

796
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,940
unfortunately the proliferation of

797
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,799
breaches out there there's also a lot of

798
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,480
information about outcomes particularly

799
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,000
negative outcomes that can then be

800
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,919
correlated with specific cyber

801
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,600
strategies but of course the goal would

802
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,919
be to move Beyond open source

803
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,419
intelligence and have organizations

804
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,480
share with a single Source a data

805
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,559
aggregator

806
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,899
strategy details and outcome details in

807
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,000
an anonymous way in a secure way so

808
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,260
these analytics can be done

809
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,899
some quick examples and again this is

810
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,539
looking from the Cyber strategy decision

811
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:00,779
maker level you always are trying to

812
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,760
answer questions like these and this is

813
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,880
a tiny little slice and I already made a

814
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,799
lot of a lot of sport of the topic of

815
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,539
cyber security training but think about

816
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,600
incident incident response you know all

817
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,919
the different ways you can design

818
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,080
Implement and manage an incident

819
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,020
response program

820
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,000
proactively before you need it hopefully

821
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,820
there are so many variables so what you

822
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,279
can or can't do in an IR program for how

823
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,020
you do or don't use third-party support

824
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,480
for how you structure the team for what

825
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,460
you include in your IR plan and the

826
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,020
policy that drives in what you don't

827
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,779
there are so many variables but you know

828
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:38,640
with the with the size of cyber

829
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,880
Security's extent across all Industries

830
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,799
right now we're going to be able to find

831
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,620
examples of so many different ways that

832
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,419
real organizations

833
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:51,779
have tried to implement their IR program

834
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,520
and where that failed and where it

835
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,799
succeeded where the response times were

836
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,659
short where they were ridiculously long

837
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,580
where the IR program just flat failed

838
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,380
and they had to make changes and when

839
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,419
those changes are made I want a huge set

840
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:05,820
of data points that is it turns out we

841
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,740
need to have our IR plan include these

842
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,899
things because when the crap hit the fan

843
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,360
this didn't work

844
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,539
sharing that again at a very broad scale

845
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,340
amongst thousands and thousands of other

846
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,380
organizations anonymously contributing

847
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,360
this information allowing us to

848
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,860
calculate and see what those Trends look

849
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,840
like and have an AI learn what the

850
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,419
trends are and what works best and

851
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,940
answer specific questions for the Cyber

852
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,460
decision makers instead of based on

853
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,779
I hate to say a set of based on

854
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:34,980
conferences that I'm speaking at a

855
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,840
Converse but instead of just based on

856
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,860
what they learned at a conference

857
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,600
instead of just based on the trend of

858
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,520
the day and the latest acronym that's

859
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,559
dominating the Cyber headlines

860
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,360
based on

861
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,860
a thousand other companies in their

862
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,020
industry that are near their size based

863
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,820
on what has actually worked we kind of

864
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,399
coined a little phrase Chase what works

865
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,940
what if we can chase what works in cyber

866
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,020
security

867
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,840
like how great would that be again at

868
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,299
the highest levels to be able to look at

869
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:05,520
what approaches work the best and use

870
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,360
that

871
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,320
as our guide

872
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,779
and then you can take it even further

873
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:15,000
you think about budgets

874
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,760
teams how you organize and use socks

875
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,919
what you do in the cloud what you do in

876
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,779
multi-cloud what you do in hybrid Cloud

877
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,299
environments and how you approach those

878
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:27,539
operational aspects and security aspects

879
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,460
how you manage your assets

880
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,320
your vendor management vendor management

881
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,860
alone is such a huge part of this puzzle

882
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,679
again this is not at all a tactical part

883
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,360
of cyber security but four is it a

884
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,580
critical one in the mid-market upper mid

885
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,200
Market at the Enterprise I mean just how

886
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,760
many hundreds of vendors is a typical

887
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,860
organization use to the thousands of

888
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,620
vendors a lot of progress has been made

889
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,240
I would say in the past 10 years a ton

890
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,700
of progress has been made forced by

891
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,380
large vendors onto the smaller and

892
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,000
smaller ones to begin doing actual

893
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,980
vendor cyber security management

894
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,539
we're looking at these companies to

895
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:01,799
provide us services and we're making

896
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,020
sure that they have cyber programs and

897
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,100
we're checking with them annually

898
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,360
hopefully

899
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,340
maybe twice a year we're doing

900
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,440
questionnaires we're sending them VSA

901
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,880
we're doing a Sig light we're doing

902
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,620
something we're using one of these 30

903
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,940
different vendors that's popped up now

904
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,140
that we'll do it for you that'll send

905
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,120
out questionnaires we're Gathering data

906
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,159
we're hoping it's working

907
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,159
I want to know right now as a CSO which

908
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,440
of those 25 different variables I just

909
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,519
named

910
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,679
gives me the best results for keeping my

911
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:30,659
vendors secure and keeping my company

912
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,340
secure that uses these vendors which one

913
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,360
works best

914
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,159
should I use a third party should I do

915
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:36,360
it myself

916
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,460
should I be sending out the Sig light

917
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,100
should I be a VSA person should I build

918
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,840
my own I don't know

919
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,760
and I will never know if someone doesn't

920
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,799
start collecting the data and looking at

921
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,179
the correlations for what gives the best

922
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:50,100
actual results who's done these things

923
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,080
and been like oh my gosh we haven't had

924
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,880
an issue with a vendor in five years or

925
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,679
we've done these things and we keep

926
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,080
having vendor problems because of how

927
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,700
we're doing vendor management those

928
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,200
answers are out there the data

929
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,120
correlations exist and no one's looking

930
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,500
at them

931
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,000
there's another cool piece of this

932
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,980
puzzle that I kind of left out and

933
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,500
that's academic research which also I

934
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,699
don't even know if I included in the

935
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,500
slides that might be my mistake

936
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,320
on top of all of that worldwide lab of

937
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,460
organizations

938
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,639
you've got thousands and thousands

939
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,139
of peer-reviewed Journal articles that

940
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,399
are produced every year in cyber

941
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,599
security

942
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,859
and you know where they're getting used

943
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:28,320
they're only getting used typically when

944
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,060
a startup comes along that wants to do

945
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,739
something related to something one of

946
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,780
those articles or the authors want to

947
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,859
start a company based on the

948
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:36,359
dissertation work they did and the

949
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:37,859
journal article they did for a cool New

950
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,300
Concept and they're going to leverage

951
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,460
that heavily they've got you know case

952
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,839
studies they've got peer-reviewed

953
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,639
research they've got well-defined

954
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,260
confidence intervals and all the data

955
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,359
quantitative and qualitative analyzes

956
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,239
for what works great in this part of

957
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,440
cyber

958
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,679
why as a c so why can't I see that why

959
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,720
can't I see someone go around and

960
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,099
collect all of that fully cited

961
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,060
peer-reviewed journal and research date

962
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,560
all those case studies all those

963
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,900
analytics on specific cyber domain

964
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,359
strategies and feed that into the same

965
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,500
engine

966
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,420
parameterize that data use it as

967
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,820
weighting factors as appropriate

968
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,640
to help feed the answers so that I can

969
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,380
simultaneously see not only what works

970
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,140
best from specific organizations

971
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,060
and then analyzing that data but I can

972
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,800
look and see what the researchers have

973
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,320
found and have that Blended in and maybe

974
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,579
even go a little deeper and find out

975
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,200
what was behind that because there

976
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,700
you've got again you've got specific

977
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,680
confidence intervals you know what

978
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,079
worked and why how they did it

979
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,900
that's a ton of data but I know is a CCO

980
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,160
I didn't have time for that for that

981
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,619
much I think maybe once or twice in the

982
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,359
five years I was the CSO of that

983
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,040
pharmaceutical company I really leaned

984
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,420
into some academic research because I

985
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,740
didn't have time at one point I had

986
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,720
someone who worked for me do some but

987
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,300
how great would that be if we can get

988
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,940
access to not only that worldwide lab

989
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,460
but the Academia as well

990
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,380
and again that point that I mentioned

991
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,720
earlier blending in the cost factors

992
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,599
that is a tremendous opportunity because

993
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,619
then

994
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:10,940
you can look at Roi

995
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,060
okay well I kind of already said all

996
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,300
this once parameterized you can do a lot

997
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,240
of great stuff and again the AI the

998
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,339
machine learning person portion takes us

999
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:25,079
a little further because then you can

1000
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,500
use the results you get to train a

1001
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,300
machine learning algorithm over time to

1002
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,160
get better and better at seeing and

1003
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,099
advance and doing Predictive Analytics

1004
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:36,780
particularly maybe in an industry maybe

1005
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,520
in a vertical maybe in a sector for an

1006
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,700
industry in a size range for what looks

1007
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,359
right what trends show success what

1008
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,920
decisions give the right outcomes and

1009
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,800
why and with data supporting it so what

1010
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,740
I Envision is

1011
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,599
outputs from a tool like this that not

1012
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,839
only show me real world Roi based on

1013
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,359
actual data from other organizations

1014
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,579
taking that and putting into a nice

1015
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,680
deliverable graphic format and when it's

1016
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,359
time for me to start initiative a or

1017
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,579
initiative B in my cyber program taking

1018
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:11,099
that to my CEO and CFO who don't want to

1019
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,960
hear another budget requests taking that

1020
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,940
to the board of directors and saying

1021
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,579
hi this is what we need and here's why

1022
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,880
because the data says so because the

1023
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,520
organizations are showing the ROI it's

1024
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,920
the cost Factor we have to spend money

1025
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,660
we have budget needs sure but guess what

1026
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,900
there is a return on this we very rarely

1027
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,720
see a negative Roi for good cyber

1028
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,520
initiatives because good cyber

1029
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,540
initiatives the ones that really have

1030
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,700
high impact the cost of avoidance Factor

1031
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,920
the losses the the the things that are

1032
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,200
avoided cost wise and loss wise are

1033
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,700
tremendous

1034
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,200
that this is something that's kind of

1035
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,060
well known but it's it's one thing they

1036
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,380
just have a bunch of assumptions and do

1037
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,140
it as an individual what if we have a

1038
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,140
massive collection of worldwide data a

1039
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,940
global data pool

1040
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,859
that we can then show those decision

1041
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,820
makers and say hey this is the ROI and

1042
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,740
it's not just this is looking at data

1043
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,359
from all over the world

1044
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:09,660
so we want to spend this and this is the

1045
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,160
return on it

1046
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,960
I see that as a powerful potential

1047
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,300
weapon so not only do we increase the

1048
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,280
security of organizations by chasing

1049
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,339
what works we also are able to have a

1050
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,640
very clear analytical tool

1051
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,380
a weapon in the hands of those decision

1052
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,500
makers to get Forward Motion in their

1053
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,280
cyber programs

1054
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,300
okay let me move on to barriers here in

1055
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,740
the last few minutes of this

1056
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,140
conversation again I mentioned earlier

1057
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,720
we were talking about my dream of a

1058
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,060
graphic floating in air in front of me

1059
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,119
UI I still want that and I want somebody

1060
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,099
to design it before I die and so I'm

1061
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,960
going to keep pushing for it

1062
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,660
that's really hard right it may have to

1063
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,220
start with us having you know a puck in

1064
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,780
our hands that can project a holographic

1065
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,520
image that we can look at and interact

1066
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,200
with right like we do with a smartphone

1067
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,760
I would take that in a heartbeat that

1068
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,260
would be so cool

1069
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,480
am I crazy I might be crazy I think that

1070
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,400
would be so cool or a heads-up display

1071
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,320
in my car which you can already get in

1072
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,060
really nice cars how great would that be

1073
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,280
there's barriers to all these things we

1074
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,800
have some very specific barriers to

1075
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,599
outcome-based cyber security being real

1076
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,640
here in the world right now

1077
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,900
um you have the potential for some very

1078
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,700
big data and I don't mean big a new

1079
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,020
volume

1080
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,940
um those who have a data analytics

1081
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,400
background you'll probably know that uh

1082
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,920
data Big Data as a definition is not

1083
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,680
just volume they usually use one of the

1084
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,020
v's or the three V's model to describe

1085
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,980
big data in this case data velocity

1086
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,440
date of veracity the truthfulness and

1087
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,660
accuracy of data and the value density

1088
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,760
of data would be the three V's that

1089
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,380
might make this a very challenging Big

1090
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,820
Data scenario

1091
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,280
the way that you can parameterize cyber

1092
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,500
strategy data may not lead to massive

1093
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,900
volume of data in terms of you know how

1094
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,660
many terabytes or gigabytes of data but

1095
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,880
the velocity with which such changes

1096
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,099
occur on a global scale

1097
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:08,099
understanding the truthfulness the

1098
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:11,220
veracity of that data Big Challenge and

1099
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,740
value density is a big thing

1100
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,240
particularly in social media and on the

1101
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,820
open internet there's so much news

1102
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,960
there's so much social media

1103
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,119
conversation about cyber strategies and

1104
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,579
outcomes about incidents about losses

1105
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:26,160
about insurance about varying strategies

1106
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,960
in every single cyber domain and again

1107
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,460
you can pick a domain and you only have

1108
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,859
a ton of available data just about that

1109
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:34,619
domain it Asset Management IR Dr

1110
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:36,619
vulnerability management and patching

1111
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:38,880
whatever it is there's gonna be a ton of

1112
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,339
data out there but how much of that do

1113
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,079
you need to absorb

1114
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,240
to get a certain level of value out of

1115
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,339
it that's value density and that's a

1116
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:49,619
challenge dealing with massive amounts

1117
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:51,660
of data in order to get relatively small

1118
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,339
amounts of value out

1119
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:56,240
is a value density challenge

1120
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,200
confidentiality is obviously a challenge

1121
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,460
as well I've mentioned the word

1122
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,200
anonymously several times during the

1123
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,540
talk but it's still a challenge getting

1124
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,359
the worldwide lab to share even

1125
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:09,800
anonymously at the Cyber decision making

1126
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,940
level is a challenge

1127
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,560
that needs to be overcome now the good

1128
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,119
news about that is

1129
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,099
and this is something I've learned a lot

1130
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,839
more in the past six months

1131
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,339
may not be a biggest challenge as the

1132
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:21,900
Big Data challenge because in some of

1133
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,760
the others because

1134
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,339
it's not that rare we're discovering

1135
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:30,119
that companies are willing to share for

1136
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:33,060
such a benefit we've had in particular

1137
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,560
some very large organizations that have

1138
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,880
said this sounds really good are you

1139
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,260
sure you can do it like heck yeah we can

1140
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,680
do it let's talk further

1141
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,680
complexity parameterizing all of these

1142
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,200
decisions all the Cyber strategy domains

1143
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,240
that might be the number one challenge

1144
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,040
that's why I put it in the middle that's

1145
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,619
a big challenge the complexity piece is

1146
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,720
phenomenal starting off with a rather

1147
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,420
core set of parameterized decisions in

1148
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,740
each cyber domain is a great starting

1149
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,420
point but it's going to grow in

1150
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,000
complexity it needs to grow because the

1151
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,560
the decision space that you'd want to

1152
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,460
model

1153
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,099
still staying strategic are tremendously

1154
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,260
broad so there's a lot of complexity to

1155
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,880
track there's a lot of there's a lot of

1156
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,040
meat there there's a lot of gold to be

1157
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,660
mined as you get deeper and deeper into

1158
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,440
how you structure decision chains one

1159
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,000
key aspect that

1160
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,619
um that I think is really useful is

1161
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:27,180
looking not just at the pure yes no and

1162
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,820
numeric strategy decisions again like in

1163
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,920
cyber training a number of times per

1164
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,260
year

1165
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,060
flags for how you conduct it rather it's

1166
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,000
third party or internal rather it is a

1167
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,619
carrot or stick driven and things like

1168
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,140
that but another useful area that adds a

1169
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,880
lot of complexity but that seems to be

1170
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,440
very powerful is looking at more

1171
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,180
qualitative aspects from the decision

1172
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,700
maker level like what's the confidence

1173
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,500
level that you as a decision maker have

1174
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,300
in your current cyber security strategy

1175
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,040
if you had to give yourself a grade from

1176
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,560
zero to 100 like and you look across

1177
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,960
your current strategies in a given realm

1178
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,020
confidence levels level of revisit and

1179
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,180
review of your own internal outcomes

1180
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,640
visibility tracking things like that

1181
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,160
again at the decision maker level we can

1182
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,200
parameterize those and cross compare

1183
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,940
them even though they're qualitative and

1184
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,819
not really objective

1185
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:22,619
Trends can still be determined by

1186
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,240
looking across massive amounts of them

1187
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,880
we may be able to correlate Trends such

1188
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,160
as when a given collection of csos in a

1189
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,380
given Industries really have a low

1190
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,839
confidence in their own implementation

1191
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,060
and given cyber Street a cyber strategy

1192
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,579
area they're often really right or maybe

1193
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:40,680
it's the converse maybe low confidence

1194
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,660
areas are not aligning with poor

1195
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,880
performance those seem to also give

1196
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,319
great insights

1197
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,540
but boy is it complex there's a lot that

1198
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,460
can be done there

1199
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,020
uniqueness

1200
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,180
a significant challenge the idea behind

1201
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,119
mining the data of the world cyber

1202
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,099
security programs

1203
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:00,900
kind of mandates there's only one of

1204
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,680
these

1205
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,300
if you have two collections of

1206
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,099
information like this

1207
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:07,980
you've cut the capacity you've cut the

1208
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,540
analytic power

1209
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,280
by more than half

1210
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,440
so that's a little bit of a challenge as

1211
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,359
well and then of course novelty this is

1212
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,160
a very brand new idea this is not

1213
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,800
something that's been looked at before

1214
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,240
it very well might be the right time to

1215
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,680
look at it which is why we're here while

1216
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,660
we're talking about it but it's a very

1217
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,480
new and novel concept how to make and

1218
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,700
execute on it is all brand new

1219
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,619
and of course that's the the mission

1220
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:33,839
nature of of what we're trying to do

1221
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,060
spread this idea spread this concept and

1222
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,220
get buy-in from organizations that might

1223
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,819
want to try it want to look for a future

1224
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:43,560
we tend to call it like the the cyber

1225
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,420
security strategy Revolution might want

1226
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,760
to be a part of revolutionizing how

1227
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,160
cyber strategy decisions are made

1228
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,200
uh last piece of this

1229
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,079
um before I wrap up uh is kind of the

1230
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:56,819
the more forward-looking aspect of this

1231
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,200
which is both a barrier and an

1232
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,579
opportunity

1233
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:01,140
um in a lot of ways what I've described

1234
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,880
sort of talks about what you would do if

1235
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,520
you are designing and launching a cyber

1236
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,079
security program from scratch and you

1237
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,220
wanted to answer those kinds of

1238
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,740
questions another aspect of this

1239
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,599
capability particularly

1240
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,460
getting it mature and getting to the

1241
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,440
place where your your AI has learned a

1242
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,119
lot about the nature of different

1243
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:21,060
Industries strategies and outcomes is

1244
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,460
what it can do in a forward-looking

1245
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,520
change management perspective

1246
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,260
and it's this is a barrier in a way

1247
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,060
because getting there is also a big

1248
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,240
challenge but imagine the idea as a CSO

1249
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,740
as a decision maker

1250
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,839
you are looking at massive business

1251
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:39,359
change say an acquisition or spinning

1252
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,400
off of a company or a massive wave of

1253
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,500
new hires or significant technology

1254
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,460
change

1255
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,680
uh deciding you're going to go from your

1256
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,300
current cloud-based approach for almost

1257
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,859
all of your business systems to a hybrid

1258
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:51,960
approach or coming back to an on-prem

1259
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,839
approach or any of these massive changes

1260
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,660
once again organizations all over the

1261
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,359
world have made these changes before

1262
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,760
and have had strategies to do them from

1263
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,380
a security perspective and have had

1264
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,640
outcomes

1265
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,560
so we also have then this change

1266
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,440
management tool that I as a CSO I can go

1267
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,359
in and say hey this is about to happen

1268
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:14,400
this category of change I'm about to go

1269
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,220
through and again parameterizing it

1270
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,220
complex but doable and then finding out

1271
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,900
what the best approach is for managing

1272
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,660
that type of change might be growth

1273
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,819
shrinking splitting dividing hiring

1274
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:29,099
firing massive change of different types

1275
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:31,380
change of course is the enemy

1276
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,960
of any cyber security program the more

1277
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,940
Broad and dynamic the change typically

1278
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,520
the more risk best example might be the

1279
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,660
pandemic

1280
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,160
how do I wish that someone was

1281
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,680
harvesting what happened to all those

1282
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,380
organizations and how they managed their

1283
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,099
covid transitions to work from home we

1284
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,260
all know a lot of breaches resulted in

1285
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,359
the months and now still years following

1286
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:57,060
Mass work from home with poor execution

1287
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,000
poor enablement turning on tools buying

1288
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,740
things randomly buying new laptops and

1289
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,119
wondering why six months a year later

1290
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,640
everybody's got ransomware that kind of

1291
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,720
change

1292
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,780
if we had that data when it happens you

1293
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,280
can get a starting point for what the

1294
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,160
best strategies are at what cost

1295
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,339
what the ROI is for a specific set of

1296
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:20,520
strategies to manage that change

1297
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,180
so early on mid-stage mature programs

1298
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,819
regardless the benefit can be there if

1299
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:28,260
we're willing to kind of chase after

1300
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,160
this

1301
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,859
Revolution

1302
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:35,340
and that is all

1303
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:39,860
[Applause]

1304
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,300
are we supposed to do q a

1305
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,319
was anybody now

1306
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,520
I'm out of time so I mean I supposed to

1307
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,020
beat all 1050 but I guess the next talk

1308
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,240
doesn't start till 11. so

1309
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,799
anybody have questions yes

1310
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,300
I love that little

1311
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,140
people talking about

1312
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,780
yes

1313
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,920
they're collecting at least some

1314
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,260
generic information and a very

1315
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,440
consistent way that might help you

1316
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,540
answer some of those basic questions

1317
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,980
and if you can get visibility from other

1318
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,000
writers you might

1319
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,319
you could not be more right and both

1320
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,940
things you just said the first piece

1321
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,940
there's never a way to get 100 of the

1322
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,240
human aspects parameterized at least not

1323
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,040
yet I shouldn't say that because I still

1324
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,720
think I want to get my 3D user interface

1325
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,339
sometime in my lifetime too maybe

1326
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:13,319
someone will do that but you're right

1327
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:15,720
that level of complexity I don't know if

1328
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,940
the value would be there the ROI might

1329
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,380
not be there if we've been trying to go

1330
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,240
there and that's why and this is an

1331
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,380
interesting point earlier this week

1332
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,599
someone said to me are you trying to

1333
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,520
replace these those with this tool

1334
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,339
and I'm like there's no way people are

1335
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:31,079
the core of all of these things and

1336
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:32,880
humans are the center of cyber security

1337
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,420
this is a tool to be in a cso's handbag

1338
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,520
so that they understand and can see what

1339
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,780
works best in different areas of

1340
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,640
strategy but the human factor you can

1341
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,160
never fully emulate and that's okay I

1342
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,660
don't mind that the second piece the

1343
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,260
insurance that is a gold mine and I have

1344
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,020
no hesitation in saying that yes that is

1345
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,420
true and partnering with us on this are

1346
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,220
some insurance companies for exactly

1347
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,119
that reason

1348
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,099
they are a gold mine of data and they

1349
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:00,720
are so interested in whatever can be

1350
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,420
done to help reduce this type of

1351
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,579
strategic risk for their organizations

1352
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:06,780
they underwrite

1353
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,000
so those conversations are a live thing

1354
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,400
happening right now and is is fantastic

1355
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,079
so 100 agree

1356
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,839
anybody else

1357
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,800
yes

1358
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,760
through a back

1359
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,579
I've got the you know

1360
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:40,680
you know commotion of density of

1361
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,480
properties

1362
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,280
realistically we've got around 350

1363
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,140
you're taking those calculations testing

1364
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,940
them put it into the real world

1365
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,599
applications seeing if they still work

1366
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,520
you and I say how to apply to those that

1367
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,260
hurt too with those kids on Saturday

1368
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,619
morning one of my questions

1369
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:08,040
with AI and this propensity to create

1370
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,859
algorithms that are biased sort of that

1371
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,460
are incorrect

1372
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:19,500
that's 100 right

1373
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,319
um and the answer is a lot of iteration

1374
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,960
a lot of testing uh it's one of the

1375
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,520
challenges that honestly comes below

1376
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,839
that complexity

1377
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,339
Banner in the middle of the challenge

1378
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:31,619
screen because there it is this is such

1379
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:34,319
a New Concept and the data load required

1380
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,960
in a parameterized sense even when you

1381
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,460
start with a core set of parameters that

1382
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,559
you have well-defined the data load and

1383
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,920
then understanding and uh and rating the

1384
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,920
confidence levels the accuracy and the

1385
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,400
reliability is a major load luckily

1386
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,599
um we got data scientists that are

1387
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,280
working on exactly that to get a

1388
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,960
starting point but it's going to take

1389
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,119
time it'll take time and iterative

1390
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,579
development to get to the point where we

1391
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:02,760
know what we have at a certain level of

1392
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,440
confidence and can communicate that in

1393
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,940
the same way luckily it made I think a

1394
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,400
super long time because we can structure

1395
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,020
the parameters that we are measuring in

1396
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,240
such a way that you know kind of baby

1397
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,980
steps starting with structures that are

1398
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,839
kind of easier to manage and easier to

1399
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,700
verify and validate easier to get the

1400
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,420
veracity factors known for analyze and

1401
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,400
iterate on those and then expand and

1402
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,040
expand and expand so it's iterative and

1403
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,480
yes it's going to take time but at the

1404
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,460
same point we know we can start

1405
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,960
kind of start in a safe space start

1406
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,960
where we know we are good and show that

1407
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,579
value and then move on and run on from

1408
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:39,059
there so but no question about it it is

1409
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:41,700
the the more broad we get as we try to

1410
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,680
model more and more complex interactions

1411
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,200
and when we start modeling across cyber

1412
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,540
domains which is that's the big thing

1413
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,160
it's one thing to say for example we

1414
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,200
want to look at our the best strategies

1415
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,079
and outcomes for uh for changing human

1416
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:57,599
behavior through cyber training or for

1417
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,160
the best outcomes and incident response

1418
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,540
by how you align your program but what

1419
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,280
about when you cross analyze all those

1420
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,200
factors and I want to see the optimal

1421
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,180
correlations for cyber training and

1422
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,000
awareness and incident response ndr

1423
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,859
and homopolitism procedures are arranged

1424
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:12,240
on my compliance program my risk

1425
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,319
management program and I want to take

1426
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:15,240
all seven of those factors

1427
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,819
and cross-correlate them at once

1428
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,400
for the best outcomes that's the

1429
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,200
complexity level that we get to quickly

1430
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,839
which I absolutely love and our data

1431
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:26,760
scientists think I'm crazy but it's

1432
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,319
doable

1433
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,220
um and that's where we're heading

1434
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:37,099
anybody else last minute questions

1435
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,619
um so here in the room are three people

1436
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:42,420
from our little team and if you want to

1437
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,980
talk more about any of the above we'll

1438
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,359
be here in the room afterwards and out

1439
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,099
Friday there's Jeremy and Drew in the

1440
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,140
back they're hands up and here is Daniel

1441
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,579
up front

1442
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:52,200
um these guys are here with me key

1443
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,880
members of our team and we would love to

1444
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,079
chat with anybody who wants to talk

1445
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:57,420
further about any of this and we brought

1446
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,040
some swag with us which is pretty cool

1447
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,079
stuff that we're just going to give away

1448
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:02,760
while we're walking around today thank

1449
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,900
you guys

1450
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,110
for coming greatly appreciated

1451
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:09,239
[Applause]
