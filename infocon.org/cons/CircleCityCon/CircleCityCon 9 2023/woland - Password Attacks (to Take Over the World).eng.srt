1
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,000
brief introduction name is wolin from

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,340
the square State as I said I work

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,859
professionally as a pin tester

4
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,080
before I was in cyber I was working as a

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,300
journalist and in hospitality

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,280
I have some other qualifications and

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,800
certifications but I don't really think

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,120
those are that important to mention

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,379
right now

10
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,940
what I can tell you is I have

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,280
successfully exploited password attacks

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,980
in the field against clients

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,440
and I will be posting the slides to that

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,600
uh Twitter address after the

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,280
presentation so don't feel pressure to

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,260
take any pictures

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,600
uh to get the perfunctory disclaimer out

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,520
of the way nothing I say or do not say

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,320
today is a reflection of the views of my

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,739
employer

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,939
okay

22
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,780
so I want to go back 20 years ago

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,060
like a little flashback sequence

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,220
I'm a jerk teenager

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,740
I'm barely a teenager

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,020
and I really enjoy what we called

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,860
surfing the whip back then

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,259
and some of my favorite places to hang

29
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,780
out were online forms

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,759
they're basically Message Board systems

31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,200
that were hosted by the web for people

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,520
who don't know

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,680
you'd have multiple forums with

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,900
different subjects and then you could

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,360
register as a user on the platform

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,299
you could take on an identity and you

37
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,400
could post about whatever you wanted and

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,259
other users would usually respond back

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,040
and some of the people who are on these

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,200
platforms were hackers some of them were

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,560
Tech enthusiasts and some were just

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,960
people who were you know wanted to write

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,119
about and talk about some of the movies

44
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,680
or music or whatever it was they were

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,799
into

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,080
so every so often on these forums we'd

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,660
have a new user register right and then

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,980
they'd go to one of the forums and

49
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,500
introduce themselves

50
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,440
and it often went like this

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,180
hello

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,940
my name is Nutter butter 5000 or

53
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,800
whatever it was

54
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,200
uh do any of you have any tools for

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,060
hacking Hotmail

56
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,580
I think my girlfriend is cheating on me

57
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,280
or partner or a partner whatever

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,560
and uh you know I really just want to

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,660
find out any help or tools you can give

60
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,920
me would be much appreciated thanks

61
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,599
and it was usually way less coherent

62
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,420
than that I'm just summarizing here

63
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,680
foreign

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,300
the members of the community when they

65
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,500
would see posts like this they didn't

66
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,959
usually take it very well that person

67
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,480
was usually you know insulted or called

68
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,879
a bunch of names

69
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,459
and one day when this happened I got the

70
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,200
bright idea to try and break into that

71
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,738
person's account

72
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,819
so I logged out of the Forum under my

73
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,360
username and I put their username in

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,280
and then I put the first password that

75
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,019
came to my mind

76
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,420
it was password

77
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,480
I clicked enter and my heart stopped

78
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,819
it worked

79
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,799
I was in that user's account

80
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,599
and the first thing I did was go and

81
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,040
change the password so they could never

82
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,659
get back in again

83
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,239
and then the second thing I did

84
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,519
uh was go to the post that they had just

85
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,159
made edit it and write a real immature

86
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,260
message saying how much they sucked and

87
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,019
hacked by so and so you know probably an

88
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,060
elite speak probably terrible

89
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,560
and a lot of the community members found

90
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,480
it quite humorous

91
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,420
so I kept doing it anytime

92
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,700
anytime we get like you know someone

93
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,159
coming in just wanting tools or you know

94
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,220
for bad purposes we would I would

95
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,080
attempt to break into their account I'd

96
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,360
use password like password one password

97
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,799
one two three

98
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,140
variations of their username

99
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,019
and I swear 70 of the time it worked

100
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,640
and keep in mind this was 20 years ago

101
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,738
this was before there were any lockout

102
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,540
policies or really password policies

103
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,959
certainly not on a web application

104
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,220
and I just I had so much fun with that

105
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,800
and going forward 20 years later

106
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,600
I still get a warm and fuzzy feeling

107
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,639
every time I find a user's password

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,300
every time I pop it pop someone right

109
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,280
the only difference is today instead of

110
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,860
doing it to be you know as as opposed to

111
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,660
doing it to be a jerk today I'm doing it

112
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,880
to generally help people

113
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,220
uh you know see their weaknesses and

114
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,780
strengths and their security

115
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,160
and that's why I wanted to do this talk

116
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,139
today

117
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,479
so we have uh two characters up here

118
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,060
from the cartoon Dexter's Laboratory we

119
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,520
have Dexter representing infosec

120
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,919
he's very intelligent he has a secret

121
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,380
lab that he built under his house

122
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,960
and he's a big follower of processes and

123
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,720
systems like that's you know he does

124
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,180
he's not very um

125
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,060
sporadic or spontaneous

126
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,919
and then representing hacking we have

127
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,440
his older sister Dede

128
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,400
who often breaks into his lap she dances

129
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,520
around gracefully while touching buttons

130
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,500
just to see what they do

131
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,560
and she often like breaks things

132
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,900
foreign

133
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,060
in my industry and even with myself I'm

134
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,199
oftentimes more of a Dexter than a DD

135
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,840
and I love both of these characters uh

136
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,699
you know they're foils to each other one

137
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,380
can't really exist without the other

138
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,539
right

139
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,340
but what I'm really trying to strive to

140
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,740
when I am hacking is being a little bit

141
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,259
more of a deity than a Dexter

142
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,639
and that's kind of how I want this

143
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,220
presentation to be I want it to be kind

144
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,660
of fun where we're not going to take

145
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,639
ourselves too seriously

146
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,199
so I'll get started on what we're going

147
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,360
to cover today or tonight I should say

148
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,960
uh we're going to talk about password

149
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,180
spraying and guessing and what the

150
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,380
difference is we're going to talk about

151
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,880
word lists

152
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,440
we're going to talk about what a hash is

153
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,139
in cracking hashes

154
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,000
uh we're going to talk about some tools

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,620
that I use in the field

156
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,880
we're going to talk about credential

157
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,580
stuffing and breach data

158
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,720
and then we're going to talk about some

159
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,039
defenses against these attacks

160
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,960
some things we're not going to talk

161
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,340
about in this talk and I hope you're not

162
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,199
too disappointed are phishing and social

163
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,819
engineering attacks

164
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,759
uh Cloud stuff in general and identity

165
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,500
and access management

166
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,940
we're not going to talk about Hardware

167
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,280
to crack the hashes

168
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,139
I'm not going to do crabturing or

169
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,699
cracking Wi-Fi handshakes and I'm not

170
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:54,840
really going to go over authentication

171
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,100
protocols

172
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,720
and it's not that I don't think these

173
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,220
things are important

174
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,979
it's because I only have a finite amount

175
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,199
of time and also all these subjects

176
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,220
could be talks in their own right

177
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,880
they're really good

178
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,380
all right so why do passwords matter

179
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,460
I had to add this slide I'm sorry I just

180
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,940
had to

181
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,740
um so Uber unless you know about 72

182
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,020
hours ago allegedly I say allegedly

183
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,280
because we don't know everything that

184
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,780
has happened

185
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,479
uh had a breach apparently someone's

186
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,340
credentials their password and username

187
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,139
got fished

188
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,539
and although multi-factor authentication

189
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,560
was enabled the person the attacker kept

190
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,960
sending uh pushes to their cell phone

191
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,759
and then contacted them and social

192
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,620
engineered them to

193
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,419
approve the push and it allowed them

194
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,740
access

195
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,840
so once on the internal Network through

196
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,360
the VPN they came across some Powershell

197
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,500
scripts that were just sitting around

198
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,699
there

199
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,919
don't really know why they had

200
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,960
hard-coded credentials in these scripts

201
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,660
with passwords in clear text

202
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,000
and that basically gave them the keys to

203
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,639
the kingdom and game over

204
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,800
uh Uber hasn't been having a great week

205
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,840
just this week they're also in court

206
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,639
relating to a case of one of their

207
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,240
security officers who allegedly again

208
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,879
hit a breach in 2016.

209
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,800
and this one's going to be a little bit

210
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,300
harder to hide though because the 18

211
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,819
year old who allegedly did it uh live

212
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,199
tweeted all about it and showed

213
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,179
screenshots

214
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,179
so they matter

215
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,598
still

216
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,080
ending

217
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,680
look good

218
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,180
for them

219
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,339
I would never work for them but that's

220
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,140
just me

221
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,800
uh they're Secrets right they're they're

222
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,260
secrets that we have to memorize their

223
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,060
secrets that have been used for computer

224
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,120
access control since the 1960s

225
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,680
these things are results of the Vietnam

226
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,940
War right

227
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,339
uh they're shared because in order to

228
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,200
authenticate someone else on the other

229
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,700
side whoever you're authenticating to

230
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,580
has to know those your secret

231
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,320
they're prolific there's not one person

232
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,880
in here who doesn't have a password on

233
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,339
some type of platform

234
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,380
and because we as humans are the ones

235
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,700
who create them they're going to be

236
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,560
inherently flawed

237
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,940
and that's going to produce a lot of

238
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,480
weaknesses

239
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,300
so let's say there's a system we want to

240
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,980
break into maybe it's a web application

241
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,380
maybe it's a FTP server web service

242
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,300
anything like that

243
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,640
uh do you have permission to do so do

244
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,839
you have permission to break into that

245
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:43,740
system

246
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,880
is it in writing and do you have a copy

247
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,820
and what does the Target you're trying

248
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,740
to break into is it actually owned by

249
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,500
the people who gave you that permission

250
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,700
uh please please please please please

251
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,740
please with the cherry on top make sure

252
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,600
you cross off all of these check boxes

253
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,519
before you attempt to break into a

254
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,380
system I'm not talking ctfs or things

255
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,000
you're meant to hack I mean actual in

256
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,100
production systems I don't want anyone

257
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,360
to have to go in through any legal

258
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,100
trouble it's not fun

259
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,060
thank you

260
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,060
rip Phil Hartman man tragic last

261
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,480
so when I'm attempting to break into a

262
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,839
client or a Target

263
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,899
there are two things I do first and they

264
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,480
seem pretty obvious but I I guarantee

265
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,060
you that I see this a lot

266
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,459
are there any default credentials that

267
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,459
are available for this target

268
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,740
and also are the passwords just hanging

269
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,360
out anywhere there on the internet like

270
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,920
any like for one of their platforms is

271
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,459
that possible

272
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,880
this I'm not going to name the vendor

273
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,680
this is a business intelligence

274
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,480
framework

275
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,459
they have a number of user accounts

276
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,260
outside of their admin one

277
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,120
they have one called Susie one called

278
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,100
Pat one call Tiffany I'm not sure where

279
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,200
the names actually came from I'd like to

280
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,100
think it was like female 80s rock stars

281
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,779
but guess what the password is for all

282
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:13,920
those

283
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,320
it's password

284
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,899
so you know you can and this is this is

285
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,240
a screenshot taken from their manual

286
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,100
so the first thing I'm going to do if

287
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,959
I'm trying to break into that system is

288
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,720
try all those usernames and see if maybe

289
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,660
an admin didn't uh you know shut them

290
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,839
down

291
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,899
so searching for passwords let's say you

292
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,640
have a Target in this case the example

293
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,100
is domain.com

294
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,140
I'm going to use some Google dorks just

295
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,820
to see what's out there

296
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,320
um those are just parameters you can put

297
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,640
into Google some of you are probably

298
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,200
pretty familiar with them

299
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,680
to see if they have any you know to see

300
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,420
if there's the string password anywhere

301
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,399
on their domain and what that entails

302
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,740
and the file type is basically looking

303
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,240
for certain files like maybe there's a

304
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,920
PDF that mentions password that's tied

305
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,300
to their domain

306
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,700
those little things you can do to search

307
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,579
uh dork search is one that makes those

308
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,140
kind of search queries for you some of

309
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,120
them get pretty Advanced so it's an easy

310
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,940
way to do that uh kind of Open Source

311
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,839
Intelligence on your own

312
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,339
another thing I really like to do if I

313
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,019
have a Target I want to find their

314
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,579
address maybe a few of their addresses

315
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,200
or a headquarters address and I want to

316
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,640
put it in Instagram

317
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,440
or Google photo

318
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,420
you'll get a lot of interesting pictures

319
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,339
that are tied to that location

320
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,200
uh you could get pictures of badges as

321
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,459
you will see on the left here I'll go

322
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,279
into that in a second uh desks

323
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,079
people taking pictures of their kids at

324
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,100
work

325
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,480
um and then they have a desk right there

326
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,160
with a bunch of papers on it you know

327
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,600
fun things like that their intent was

328
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,160
not to share that information but they

329
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,880
did

330
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,240
uh desktop pictures my company got us a

331
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,860
new computer isn't it awesome I'm like

332
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,779
oh I can see you sportygate

333
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,860
cool see your icons on your desktop

334
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,779
the picture on the left was taken from

335
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,459
the federal law enforcement training

336
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,579
center in Glencoe Georgia it's a big

337
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,860
Federal facility that trains local state

338
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,579
and federal law enforcement

339
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,440
uh I redacted this information because

340
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,940
I'm not here to name and shame anyone

341
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,279
but this employee with the Bureau of

342
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,800
Prisons was clearly very excited

343
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,639
to go to training there

344
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,980
and you're it's not the worst thing you

345
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,899
could share on social media but also

346
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,300
what if you have a login portal

347
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,880
that requests the four last four numbers

348
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,139
of your ID your badge and your last name

349
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,860
well then it could be right there right

350
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,440
uh also this is a great way to find out

351
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,200
info on uh Target's password policy like

352
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,940
do they require capital letter do they

353
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,620
require require a special character

354
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,660
anything like that

355
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,019
uh password list ideas like if it's

356
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,820
you know at school do they have mascots

357
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,120
what is their mascot what is it called

358
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,100
if they do have like pictures of their

359
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,779
kids or dogs at work

360
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,240
yeah I'll I'll use those names to try to

361
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,139
create a password list

362
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,639
all right I just want to talk about some

363
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,019
basic lingo

364
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,839
there's password guessing

365
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,440
all that is is you're submitting a list

366
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,180
um you're submitting a password and a

367
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,980
username and you're seeing if it works

368
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,360
simple enough

369
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,339
uh you can often use automated tools to

370
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,260
do that a lot quicker than the manual

371
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,120
way

372
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,120
and it can be a little bit loud and if

373
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,680
there is any kind of lockout policy on

374
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,360
the system you're targeting uh you could

375
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,180
end up blocking out an account

376
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,420
passwords range just another type uh

377
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,980
password guessing except it's a little

378
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,260
bit more careful you have a bunch of

379
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,240
user names and one password and you

380
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,860
might try that one password against all

381
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,260
of them to see if anything pops

382
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,240
and then you'll usually you know wait 15

383
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,860
to 20 minutes or so depending on the

384
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,899
lockout

385
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,639
it's a little bit stealthier too but

386
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,560
they can be you know it can be loud too

387
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,880
depending on the alarms you have enabled

388
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,420
in your environment

389
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,040
credential stuffing

390
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,720
so all credential stuffing is it's

391
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,560
usually in publicly available

392
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,240
credentials that have usually been

393
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,000
leaked in breached data to break into a

394
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,940
system to see if they still work

395
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,100
uh you do want to be somewhat careful

396
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,839
with this

397
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,639
if you work for a local state or federal

398
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,220
government even if it's widely publicly

399
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,779
available information that's been around

400
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:42,000
for ages it could be still considered

401
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,139
stolen

402
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,480
again I'm not a lawyer

403
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,060
uh you know so I I can't offer any legal

404
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,360
advice on that there is a big difference

405
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,880
uh between like collecting a torrent of

406
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,760
some old passwords and breach data uh

407
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,980
and then also going on the dark web to

408
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,079
buy breach data from someone who you

409
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,300
don't know with cryptocurrency I don't

410
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,019
really recommend doing the latter

411
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,519
but just make sure if you're going to

412
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,380
use breach data uh

413
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:15,260
that you are cleared to do that

414
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,699
I honestly haven't had a lot of luck

415
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:20,399
using the credential harvesting honestly

416
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,980
like it's usually pretty old data and a

417
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,060
lot of it

418
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,060
uh isn't real doesn't really apply to

419
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,800
password policies but I have found it's

420
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,540
most effective when targeting a specific

421
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,740
individual

422
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,820
so if you're looking at someone's

423
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,560
individual email email address and

424
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,240
they're using the same word with numbers

425
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,579
at the end or special character that's

426
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,139
usually a pretty good indication that

427
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,300
they're using this they're using the

428
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,220
same pattern

429
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,959
there are a few sites where you can get

430
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,540
these this uh these data dumps uh

431
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,880
leaklookup.com is One D hash this one

432
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,279
they'll let you search like a domain or

433
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,800
email for nominal fee

434
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,500
and there's also a giant torrent out

435
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,139
there uh I want to say at least a few

436
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,820
terabytes of data

437
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,699
uh from past breaches and then uh Heath

438
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,579
Adams has written a little script to go

439
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,079
through that data and search through it

440
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,459
and so there's a link to that torrent

441
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,260
there as well

442
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,299
so generally the resources I uh look at

443
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,220
all right Brute Force attacks being the

444
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,500
lingo out of the way this is a very time

445
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,419
consuming password attack

446
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,460
uh you're basically trying every single

447
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,220
combo that exists of a password

448
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,260
but it can be effective if there's no

449
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,539
lockout mechanism and if there's no

450
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,820
capture anything that allows you know so

451
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,080
you're allowed to have infinite login

452
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,780
attempts and you couple that with a bad

453
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,220
password policy and you got a big

454
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,900
problem

455
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,760
and we I have seen that in the field

456
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,059
all right so we're going to break into a

457
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,919
system

458
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,900
we are going to eventually make a

459
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,280
password list

460
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,559
a potential passwords but we also need

461
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,480
users to go with that list and maybe you

462
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,720
might not know who how to get those

463
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,059
if it's like for a web application or

464
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:10,980
something that would relate to uh

465
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,380
targets you know company email addresses

466
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,400
I'll usually go to phonebook.cz they uh

467
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,200
it's free with an account and they list

468
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,000
quite a bit of addresses based off of

469
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,860
the domain

470
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,140
uh Hunter IO does the same thing but

471
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,600
it's very limited for free what I do

472
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,340
like about them is they will tell you

473
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,960
usually what pattern

474
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,940
uh that Target is using like their

475
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,799
naming convention is it a first last

476
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,900
name is it first initial last name what

477
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,059
have you so that's also very useful

478
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:43,140
we've gone over public breach data

479
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,840
oftentimes look at the company website a

480
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,160
lot of schools

481
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,860
will have uh you know directories a lot

482
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,660
of companies will have directories

483
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,400
and they're just publicly out there it's

484
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,840
a great way to get that information for

485
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,220
current users

486
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,679
linkedin's another great uh resource you

487
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,480
have a bunch of people you can usually

488
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,960
write a script to put those names from

489
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,240
the website into whatever naming

490
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,700
convention their email addresses are

491
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,380
and then there's a harvester it's a

492
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,840
Nifty little python script that can

493
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,460
search through basically all those

494
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,340
resources some require API keys

495
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,320
but I put an example of the command you

496
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,059
could put in there Dash D for your

497
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,559
domain domain.com being our Target

498
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,900
domain as an example and then B will go

499
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,419
through all the options

500
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,160
now if I'm attempting to break into like

501
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,740
an FTP server SSH server something like

502
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,480
that a web service I'm going to use and

503
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,919
start anyway

504
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,200
uh with some usernames on the right

505
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,179
there those are usually some very

506
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,799
generic ones that may have not been

507
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,080
disabled

508
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,260
okay

509
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,020
user enumeration so we from the past

510
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,780
slide we have a list of potential users

511
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,640
but we don't really know if they're

512
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,000
valid on the system that we're targeting

513
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,460
and user enumeration is just a fancy way

514
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,400
of finding valid users of a system

515
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,620
that's all it is and it usually involves

516
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,260
submitting input to a host and our

517
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,299
application or system and looking at the

518
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,280
responses you get back

519
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,500
so the password and our username is

520
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,059
incorrect if you're logging in that

521
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,679
doesn't tell us anything I don't know if

522
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,059
it was a username that was wrong or the

523
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,559
password

524
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,360
maybe I'm trying to reset a password

525
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,299
that says invalid user well that might

526
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,220
be a good indication

527
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,799
that that user doesn't exist but we

528
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,840
don't know for sure

529
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,520
uh okay so we're doing user

530
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,260
registrations

531
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,480
uh the user account already exists

532
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,640
that's perfect that tells me that that

533
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,820
user is valid and on that system

534
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,620
and if you put all this into like an

535
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,020
automated tool like a web proxy or

536
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,580
anything and you're or whatever and

537
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,080
you're doing it quickly you can usually

538
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,820
get a good idea of what users are about

539
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,860
on the system and what aren't sometimes

540
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,179
you don't have the opportunity to do

541
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,440
that sometimes you have to go in blind

542
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,220
it really depends

543
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,320
all righty so this is like my favorite

544
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,120
part about password attacks is creating

545
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,500
Word lists

546
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,840
uh there are some ones like default ones

547
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,179
that you can see uh then downloading use

548
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,760
for your own purposes uh SEC list is the

549
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,940
de facto repository for password list

550
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,280
they have a ton of stuff there a ton of

551
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,960
different protocols different use cases

552
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,900
what have you uh weakpasswords.net is

553
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,820
also a useful resource that trusted SEC

554
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,580
puts out it's a quarterly kind of list

555
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,799
so we'll like right now it have like

556
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,980
August 2022 exclamation point and like

557
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,600
Seasons uh dates months and it's really

558
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,400
useful if you are targeting a place

559
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,780
where they change their passwords

560
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,460
quarterly the employees are forced to do

561
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,500
that

562
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,740
custom list I think custom lists are

563
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,840
going to be the best way to break down

564
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,460
into any system

565
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,919
truly

566
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:57,600
seasons and months are popular sports

567
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,860
teams

568
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,080
like if I was here you know I was doing

569
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,640
an assessment today in Indiana I'd

570
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,740
probably say Kohl's 2022 exclamation

571
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,679
point go Colts you know things of that

572
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,299
nature because football season has just

573
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,159
started right

574
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,100
uh pets like I said children

575
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,559
school mascots uh variations of default

576
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,659
passwords so sometimes people are lazy

577
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,659
if your default password is let me in

578
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,000
maybe try different variations to let me

579
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,340
in with uh numbers at the end see if

580
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,799
anything takes

581
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,919
yep company name's a good one

582
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,380
uh and then there are a few tools

583
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,760
cool

584
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,039
um will actually scrape a website so

585
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,960
kind of go into that company name or

586
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,820
terms that they like to use

587
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,760
uh it will generate a list for you you

588
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,220
can also find emails crunch is my

589
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,500
favorite tool to use on the command line

590
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,780
uh Linux command line I'm not sure if

591
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,580
they make it for Windows crunching cup

592
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,740
for both Linux I'm fairly certain

593
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,600
uh but you can just make that's where

594
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,400
you can automate the process of making

595
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,860
all those lists like oh I want this word

596
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,039
with from zero to you know 2022 at the

597
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:05,640
end

598
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,260
simple enough

599
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,120
cup I really like because you can

600
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,039
actually put an interactive It'll ask

601
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,600
you questions and you can put in answers

602
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,580
and then it will make password uh

603
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,260
passwords based off of that so like

604
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,900
someone's kid's name someone's birthday

605
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,559
[Music]

606
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,740
Etc

607
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,419
word lists are only going to be as

608
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:27,059
effective as much as they are customized

609
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,790
and applicable to your environment

610
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,120
[Music]

611
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,280
that's why we do a lot of intelligence

612
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,960
and Recon right we want to we want to

613
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,780
know and make sure that we have we know

614
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,280
how the company culture is or the

615
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,120
target's culture is

616
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,140
so if we're going to attempt password

617
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,260
attacks against the web application

618
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,260
uh there are a few tools that we can use

619
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,700
um there's burp Suite professionals

620
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,380
Intruder function

621
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,600
unfortunately that does require a

622
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,320
license

623
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,760
and you do have to pay money the

624
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,980
Community Edition that they have

625
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,260
is uh not good for password attacks

626
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,539
uh but that's okay because oasp the open

627
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,520
web application security platform also

628
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,960
has a web proxy tool called zap and

629
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,940
that's the fuzzer functionality that you

630
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,000
would use for password guessing

631
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,919
and all these are these are just proxies

632
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,960
so they sit between you and the website

633
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,659
or web application and you can look at

634
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,580
the traffic going to and from

635
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,080
and you can also modify that traffic

636
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,640
uh here's an example burp I've redacted

637
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,200
some things just because it was a

638
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,000
instance I had spun up and I didn't want

639
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,740
people really messing with it

640
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,919
uh but you can see a post request for

641
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,799
with HTTP HTTP at the bottom you can

642
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,539
kind of see the email and the password

643
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,520
and that's how it's submitted to this

644
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,960
application

645
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,480
and in this box over here we can see it

646
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,919
just trying things and what the status

647
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,059
is

648
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,179
uh 401 is the HTTP status meaning it's

649
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,900
not authorized

650
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,419
and then zap is similar

651
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,039
um it's not as intuitive I don't feel

652
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,780
like they're they're they've come a long

653
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,760
way the user interface isn't exactly

654
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,559
intuitive to me but it's the same

655
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,600
principle you have these little fields

656
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,520
and then you have a list in those little

657
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,260
items in the list go into those fields

658
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,460
and then you're trying different

659
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,020
payloads with a username and password

660
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,200
foreign

661
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,799
is THC Hydra formerly Medusa

662
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,779
this is a command line password

663
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,720
attacking tool it can be used in any of

664
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,260
the uh popular operating systems

665
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,000
uh I like it because it supports

666
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,480
multiple protocols like ldap minus MySQL

667
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,179
things like that

668
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:02,460
and so that First Command there we're

669
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,260
going to take a list of users and we're

670
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,700
going to take one password this is an

671
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,440
example password spring

672
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,779
the

673
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:11,279
1270.0.1 is not a real address I'm just

674
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,020
putting it there as an example obviously

675
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,640
it's a loopback address

676
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,980
so the capital L we got a list of users

677
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,140
these are users I found either for user

678
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,299
enumeration or through open source

679
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:22,559
intelligence

680
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,360
then I'm just trying to see if password

681
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,240
321 exclamation point will work on an

682
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,080
FTP server

683
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,760
and then down below we just kind of have

684
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,580
a example of Rapid guessing we have a

685
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,659
user's list and then we just have a

686
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:37,919
password list and we'll try that

687
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,480
password for every single user on there

688
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,120
and that would be through SSH so you put

689
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,520
the protocol at the end

690
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,520
foreign

691
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,860
65 spray this is something that's used a

692
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,320
lot for client for people who are using

693
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,260
office 365. it can also do user

694
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,200
enumeration but it depends on how it's

695
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,880
implemented uh if they have like a

696
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,559
Federated mail server it's not going to

697
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,678
work

698
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,299
but all you do is you can I like Office

699
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,340
365 spray because you can set it and

700
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,820
forget it uh you can figure out what the

701
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,220
lockout is if you go to the domain and

702
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,600
you validate the domain it'll tell you

703
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,520
how many minutes the lockout is which is

704
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,440
useful

705
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,840
and so this one might have been like 15

706
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,940
so I'm going to set it to spray one

707
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,760
password every 20 minutes

708
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,299
and we have a list of user emails there

709
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,779
and then we have some weak passwords

710
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,059
and the count is I'm having to do one

711
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,640
password at a time each 20 minutes the

712
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,100
lockout is 20 minutes and the domain is

713
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,500
their domain and it will just it'll do

714
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,779
its uh sprain it'll wait 20 minutes and

715
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,860
it will go on to the next password

716
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,520
so that was online uh password attacks

717
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,500
but then there's also offline password

718
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,419
attacks that relate to cracking and

719
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:04,919
hashes

720
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,900
so I wanted to go over that a little bit

721
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,279
because I think there's some confusion

722
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,760
what is a hash

723
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,380
well

724
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,900
passwords uh generally have had some

725
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,940
issues like they originally stored on

726
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,679
systems and clear text

727
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,120
well the problem with that is if someone

728
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,799
breaks in they have access to all your

729
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,480
passwords and they can read them right

730
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,500
there

731
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,000
but passwords have to be stored

732
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,260
somewhere

733
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,880
at least at this point

734
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,000
and so the best way that we've come up

735
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,179
as humans to do that is through hashing

736
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:42,059
and all it is is it's a one-way function

737
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:45,419
that takes a string like cartoon

738
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,940
it does some math stuff to it

739
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,520
and it comes with a result like that and

740
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,520
that's an md5 hash by the way

741
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,840
in

742
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,700
when I say one way I mean it can't be

743
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,279
reversed and it does this by trap or

744
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,900
math functions

745
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,240
so this is an extremely simple example

746
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,500
but if I gave you 1093 Times 1039 and

747
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,299
said tell me what the answer is you can

748
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:10,380
tell me

749
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,360
oh it's a million you know 135 627. but

750
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,100
what if I just gave you that answer and

751
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,500
said okay I need you to find two prime

752
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,480
numbers that multiply together to get

753
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,799
this result

754
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,299
not as easy

755
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:25,980
hashing does the same thing except it's

756
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,980
way more complicated

757
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,840
and sometimes like with hashing

758
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,120
algorithms it algorithms are just the

759
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,860
way that the mathematical way it gets

760
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,140
hashed some of them are called md5

761
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,480
Shopify 12.

762
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,039
and then some a lot of times when things

763
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,360
are hashed then the hash will be hashed

764
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,279
and the hash will be hashed and it it

765
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,779
does that keeps doing that over and over

766
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,580
again for security purposes

767
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,720
that's all that is

768
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,678
yeah isn't that fun

769
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,120
yeah I've seen it

770
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,419
so I just wanted to highlight it's

771
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,039
it's related hashing is related to

772
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,000
encryption it's not the same thing

773
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,039
though again we're talking about a

774
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:17,340
one-way function where clear text isn't

775
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,480
supposed to be able to be recovered

776
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,059
right and that's the entire point if

777
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,320
someone breaks into a system and they

778
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,299
see a list of hashes

779
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:25,559
they're not going to immediately know

780
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,000
what those passwords are

781
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,740
and encryption it's a two-way function

782
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,720
you're made to be able to decrypt that

783
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,580
data if you're you know if you have the

784
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,820
keys

785
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:39,059
okay so that's great but if it's a

786
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,580
one-way function then how how do you

787
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,100
know how do passwords work between you

788
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,480
know someone who's trying to

789
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,860
authenticate and the survey the

790
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,620
studently authenticated

791
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,299
well what basically happens is when you

792
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,460
input a password somewhere it will get

793
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,899
hashed

794
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,299
uh that's usually called the crib

795
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,760
and then that hash will be compared to

796
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,679
the hash that the authenticating party

797
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,320
is stored has stored and then they'll

798
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,039
see if it matches

799
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,080
cracking hashes is the same way

800
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,480
very similar uh what you'll often do is

801
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,500
you will take a word you'll hash it

802
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,360
and then you'll look at the hash that

803
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,940
you have and see if it matches and if it

804
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,960
does

805
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,940
it's obviously the it's the same thing

806
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,340
if not it's not

807
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,919
uh keep in mind I have some really easy

808
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,720
examples over there but as the password

809
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,240
complexity increases it's going to be

810
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,260
harder to crack that hash

811
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,779
but if we look at

812
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:42,779
those strings and their hash equivalents

813
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,760
those are called rainbow tables that's

814
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,039
all it is you have strings of the

815
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,320
regular word and then you have the hash

816
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,380
it would be under whatever algorithm

817
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,720
uh project rainbow crack has a number of

818
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,140
very useful rainbow tables

819
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,779
and then crackstation.net that's an

820
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,520
online tool that you could use the crack

821
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,779
hashes

822
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:06,299
um usually it's simple word list simpler

823
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,740
wordless

824
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,960
but it can also be pretty useful it

825
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,299
depends on the complexity of your hashes

826
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,980
and whether or not they're salted

827
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,720
uh rainbow tables won't work with salted

828
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,600
hashes and let's talk about Saltine

829
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,120
let's talk about what salting is

830
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,520
so like the example before I have the

831
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,460
word cartoon

832
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,860
and say I have like a random thing I'm

833
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,539
going to append to it and it's it's

834
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:38,820
random for every user

835
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,880
so maybe moo at the end

836
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,700
and then that gets hashed

837
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,260
say someone else has the cartoon

838
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,140
password in it they put in Boo at the

839
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,340
end

840
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,779
and that gets hash those hashes are

841
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,279
going to be different

842
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,279
salting is just injecting randomness

843
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,919
into the password before it's hashed so

844
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,720
that way rainbow tables won't work

845
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:10,020
hashes where do they come from how do

846
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,340
you get them

847
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,320
well usually if someone has your hashes

848
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,799
there's been a little bit of a boo-boo

849
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,360
um

850
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,480
yeah I had to sorry

851
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,700
um but you know usually compromise

852
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,679
happened and the hashes were dumped or

853
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,179
copied by someone

854
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,399
uh maybe they were intercepted via

855
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:31,500
traffic depending on the hash

856
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,240
they were left exposed somewhere where

857
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,100
someone could just download them

858
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,200
or in a good scenario maybe you're doing

859
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,120
a password audit and you extracted them

860
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,980
yourself that would be the more positive

861
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,720
scenario but usually if I have someone's

862
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,700
ashes it's not a good thing

863
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,200
and that's when you can start cracking

864
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,320
them

865
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,299
I want to go over

866
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:54,179
um some ways to crack hashes and it's

867
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:56,760
going to start with Linux and two files

868
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,440
that are very important to doing that

869
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,539
and of course I have the penguin logo

870
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,760
for Linux

871
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,320
this also applies to Unix as well but

872
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,200
not all flavors of Unix

873
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,179
so here we have the Etsy password file

874
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,699
any user on the system

875
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,980
at least by default can access this file

876
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,679
it is made to have a list of registered

877
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,560
users on that Linux machine

878
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,020
uh here we see some users and then we

879
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,239
see an X next to it and those actually

880
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,699
that used to be where passwords were

881
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,440
stored way back when

882
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,060
in the olden days

883
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,500
now there's just an X there because

884
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,879
passwords are no longer stored in plain

885
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,619
text but that's why that file is also

886
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,659
called password

887
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:41,060
so we have a list of users that's useful

888
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,659
now we have the Etsy Shadow file and

889
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,679
this should

890
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,139
and usually is by default hopefully

891
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:53,219
only accessed by a super user like root

892
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:55,139
and this is where the salt and the

893
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,879
encrypted or the hash passwords are

894
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,040
stored

895
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,020
and it's kind of hard to see the line I

896
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,720
know but we have that first little field

897
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,119
is uh tells us the hash type in this

898
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,520
case it's a shop i12 this was taken from

899
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,680
an Ubuntu system every flavor is

900
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,000
different with the hashingly Implement

901
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,680
and then we see the salt

902
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,520
and that's useful to have if you're

903
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,040
trying to crack up some passwords right

904
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,400
uh but think about it like this if only

905
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,339
if a super user can access this then you

906
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:27,839
already own the system anyway right so

907
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,940
why not have the salts there

908
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,079
then you have the Salted hash after that

909
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,579
and so when we're attempting to crack

910
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,260
hashes on a Linux machine those are the

911
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,339
two files that we want

912
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,500
yep yep I see that on Cali I haven't

913
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,640
seen that on Ubuntu yet

914
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,540
but yeah it depends and so that that

915
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,980
first field you can always look that up

916
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,660
and find out what hashing that they are

917
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,960
using

918
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,400
so I'm I'm going to talk about some

919
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,680
windows hashes as well

920
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,440
uh active directory

921
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,480
stores a lot of different types of

922
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,099
hashes but I'm going to focus on two

923
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,480
and this is like this output you see at

924
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,460
the top that would be like if I had

925
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,619
taken over a Windows machine and dumped

926
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,839
the hashes from the memory

927
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,760
like using maybe metasployed or another

928
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,920
tool so I've already compromised one

929
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,560
machine right I dump the hashes and they

930
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,020
look like that

931
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,940
well first we have the username field

932
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,000
for administrator we got a user ID

933
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,980
didn't we have what's called a landman

934
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,119
hash

935
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,460
this is a very very old uh weak hash

936
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,020
yeah and this one's actually empty

937
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,480
usually when you see 404 e and 404e

938
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,339
that's a good indicator that it's empty

939
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:52,980
but they are still kept around every so

940
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,680
often for legacy systems

941
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,140
then we have NT hashes they're also kind

942
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,060
of kept around for legacy purposes as

943
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,220
well but it's a little bit more secure

944
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,700
than a lanman hash land man's ancient NT

945
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,099
is only slightly old

946
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:10,980
uh and a lot of people call them ntlm

947
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,020
hashes technically in tlm is the

948
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,579
Authentication Protocol not the name of

949
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:17,339
the hash but semantics in tntl in tlm

950
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:19,079
patch whatever you want to call it

951
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,060
I'm not going to be picky

952
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,460
uh

953
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,839
yep so and now oh yeah here's what I was

954
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,220
going to highlight okay so Windows

955
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,960
doesn't salt their hashes

956
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,900
Linux says Windows doesn't

957
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,160
uh a lot of times like I said these are

958
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,260
used to make sure old programs will work

959
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,960
well with the domain and they just have

960
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,180
not implemented that it's more for ease

961
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,419
of use

962
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,720
basic cap uh password cracking tool is

963
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,099
going to be John the Ripper named after

964
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:57,320
an older program called Jack the Ripper

965
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,119
um and so here's where these two Linux

966
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,800
Files come into play so say we

967
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,660
downloaded them we gain access to that

968
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,520
lytics machine

969
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,339
uh John has a a program called unshadow

970
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,079
and basically it takes these two files

971
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,760
and it puts them into one little file

972
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,339
that can be cracked

973
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:17,640
so here we're using unshadow and taking

974
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,260
those files and putting them in a file

975
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,780
called passwords.txt

976
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,180
and then John is uh you can I usually

977
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,040
use it for some simple stuff that's not

978
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,420
as complicated but you can use word

979
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,859
lists there there are a variety of

980
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:30,780
options but if I just wanted to crack

981
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,220
those passwords with a word list there's

982
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,339
a way to do it uh if you are cracking

983
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,800
into your land man uh you want to make

984
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,960
sure the format's correct there by

985
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,180
default I believe it does landman

986
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,760
so that's why you want to specify NT so

987
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,079
you're taking that list and then you're

988
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,940
taking those hashes and you're tempting

989
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,099
to see if anything matches and with

990
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,660
Windows because they're not salted you

991
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,740
don't have to worry about that

992
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,560
all right hash cat hashcat is by far the

993
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,359
best password cracking tool that is out

994
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,700
there today and it it can it will

995
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,740
continue to be it is an amazing tool

996
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,260
it's very customizable it works well

997
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,700
with a lot of hardware and it can get

998
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,220
very complicated

999
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,740
I'm only going to go over a few modes I

1000
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,839
can't do a whole talk on hashcat as much

1001
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:19,920
as I'd like to

1002
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,440
uh Dash m is the type of hash that is

1003
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,560
being used this is specified by numbers

1004
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,140
and dash a is the type of attack that's

1005
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,180
being used and we'll go over those right

1006
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,359
now

1007
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,640
I just want to give some examples of

1008
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,440
those commands so like say you have Dash

1009
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,800
M that's going to be md5-1000 NT 1800

1010
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,480
sha 15 or 5 5 12. sorry

1011
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,220
then we have a tax

1012
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,140
one is just a basic word list attack

1013
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,119
three Brute Force then we have word

1014
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,400
listed mask and mask and wordless

1015
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,599
I'll get into that soon

1016
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,880
so masks these are basically little

1017
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,260
characters that you can put in there

1018
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,520
that will symbolize a bunch of

1019
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,660
characters right

1020
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,660
uh we got one that would be lowercase

1021
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,400
one that's going to be uppercase for

1022
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,760
alpha alpha characters there we have a d

1023
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,980
for numbers

1024
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,720
and then we have an S for special

1025
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,140
characters

1026
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,099
so here's an example like a word list

1027
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:27,599
attack

1028
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,119
uh you're using Dash a0 and then you

1029
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,160
have hashes and you have a list

1030
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,560
and then we have a Brute Force attack

1031
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,119
where you're just trying to guess every

1032
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,220
single combination there's going to be

1033
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,440
no word list there and so we have our

1034
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,359
Mass there so we have one uppercase

1035
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,460
character two three lowercase characters

1036
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,160
one number and one special character

1037
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,200
oftentimes when special characters and

1038
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,520
numbers are required people are going to

1039
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,180
put those at the end

1040
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,540
and then the same can be said like if

1041
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,460
you have a word list and a mask you can

1042
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,440
combine them to where you have the mask

1043
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,180
after the words on the word list or you

1044
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,640
can do the opposite

1045
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,280
so like at the bottom you would have the

1046
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,880
uh you'd have four numbers and then you

1047
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,800
would have a the words on the word list

1048
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,460
afterwards that

1049
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,000
all right security practices uh believe

1050
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,380
it or not this is kind of a contentious

1051
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,900
issue it's one where people browbeat a

1052
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,540
lot uh their beliefs on people and kind

1053
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,440
of

1054
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,000
to the point where a lot of people kind

1055
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,200
of tune it out

1056
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,920
I'm not gonna try to get into that but I

1057
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,900
do think unique and strong passwords are

1058
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,400
the key here

1059
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,099
uh don't reuse them

1060
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,740
that's the big thing

1061
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,619
uh password managers are Nifty I'm not

1062
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,680
going to you know endorse any specific

1063
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,119
one but I'd recommend doing your

1064
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,339
research these are programs that store

1065
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:55,260
passwords for you in random and make

1066
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,940
sure they're all random

1067
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,680
and they can generate passwords on the

1068
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,040
Fly too which is really useful

1069
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,000
uh please if you do have a password

1070
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,980
manager it can be a possible single

1071
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,480
point of failure if someone accesses

1072
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,820
that that is a concern but at least try

1073
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,140
to make sure you have multi-factor

1074
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,960
authentication on those

1075
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,540
and then multifasker authentication is

1076
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,280
awesome uh

1077
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,579
it is the main it it stops about 99 of

1078
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,720
password tax

1079
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,400
unless of course you know you're

1080
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,560
continuously pushing unless you're uber

1081
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,480
and usually pushing them on a cell phone

1082
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,640
then people just apparently approve them

1083
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,260
but it's better than nothing and there

1084
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,119
are certain types of MFA like SMS people

1085
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,619
are worried about oh Sim swapping

1086
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,000
someone's going to take over your phone

1087
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,460
it's possible but it's certainly better

1088
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,560
than nothing so generally what I'll

1089
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,599
recommend is just if you have it even if

1090
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,880
it's only based off of phone messages

1091
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,900
just enable it

1092
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,160
and you can do a lot of that with the

1093
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,420
passing manager you can audit yourself

1094
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,000
if you actually have an environment I'm

1095
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,880
a big fan of d-pat uh what it will do is

1096
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,800
you take hashes and then you crack them

1097
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,960
and it will analyze those and find

1098
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,700
patterns

1099
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,560
and you can see kind of where your weak

1100
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,819
points are like if there's a default

1101
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:07,020
password you're seeing a lot in your

1102
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,940
company it's very useful

1103
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,480
foreign

1104
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,140
thing I want to talk about the elephant

1105
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,359
in the room uh you could say well and

1106
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:20,040
what about those those passwordless

1107
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,920
applications I I hear that's the future

1108
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,900
secure and passwordless Future

1109
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,900
uh it is uh you have Fido which is a

1110
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,579
trade group that has partnered with the

1111
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:32,940
World Wide Web Consortium which does a

1112
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,380
lot of international standards for the

1113
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,339
web

1114
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:37,800
and they have come up with webassin

1115
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,079
which is going to be a passwordless way

1116
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,960
to authenticate yourselves on the web on

1117
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,180
on applications right

1118
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,339
uh it was only approved as a standard in

1119
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:48,900
2019

1120
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,540
and it can break things too and

1121
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,460
implementing it's going to take a lot of

1122
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,240
time

1123
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,460
change costs money change usually

1124
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,960
relates to change management at a

1125
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,500
company it can be arduous and I I see a

1126
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,940
lot of applications and systems that

1127
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,980
don't even have multi-factor enabled

1128
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,780
it's going to be a while before we see

1129
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,540
this enabled like Google windows hello

1130
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,579
you know they they have it and I'm not

1131
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:13,260
worried about the bigger dogs here it's

1132
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,819
going to be the littler people who are

1133
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,520
going to take a while to implement this

1134
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,680
but all it is is asymmetric encryption

1135
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,480
it's a private key and a public key

1136
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,560
and if someone did get access to your

1137
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,940
private key then it'd be the same as

1138
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,440
having your password

1139
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,180
but it is I do think it's a step in the

1140
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,880
right direction and uh I'm looking

1141
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,800
forward to see uh to see more of what

1142
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,920
Fido is going to come up with

1143
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,440
I did want to dedicate this talk to my

1144
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,859
grandmother uh he uh was born in or

1145
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:46,020
she's from Indiana she graduated from

1146
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,359
Purdue in 1942.

1147
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:50,760
traveled around the world Iran and China

1148
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,680
all kinds of crazy places

1149
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,780
and so I just really enjoyed being able

1150
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,460
to speak in Indiana sorry about the late

1151
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,700
start

1152
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,540
and if we have time that's going to be

1153
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,640
my presentation and I know we all have

1154
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,839
parties to get to but if there are any

1155
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,099
questions or concerns feel free to let

1156
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:06,890
me know

1157
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:10,009
[Applause]
